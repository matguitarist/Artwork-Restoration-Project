            fitness fans with busy schedules, in an affordable and fun way. 10 Minute Solution combines the ease of the
            popular fitness DVDs with casual gaming fun. The game allows players to construct regimens from a wide
            variety of 10 minute routine blocks, organized into three main categories: cardio boxing, mixed games and
            aerobics. 10 Minute Solution is designed to captivate fitness enthusiasts and gamers alike with intense
            routines that play as a game, unlike other fitness games that simply have the player following a trainer on

        <story>Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None is the title of a 2005 point-and-click adventure game developed
            by AWE Productions and published by The Adventure Company for Microsoft Windows. It was the first in The
            Adventure Company s Agatha Christie series. The game is a detective murder-mystery; it begins with nine
            people, including Patrick Narracott, the playable character, who meet and journey to the fictional Shipwreck
            Island. There, two additional onscreen characters are introduced, and the story then follows the events that
            unfold.

            And Then There Were None retains most of the basic plot elements of Agatha Christie s novel of the same
            name, with the major differences being the inclusion of the playable character, Patrick Narracott, and the
            creation of a range of possible endings. In order to further the connection between the game and its source
            material, Christie s novel is included in the North American release of the game.</story>

            The game s plot follows Poirot as he investigates the murder of a noted actress on an island. It is divided

            people. Despite being brothers, both sons have very different personalities; where Edward suggests fighting
            to collect the resources they need, his brother William offers a more peaceful approach, suggesting they
            explore new and unsettled lands to the south.With the agreement of his father, William heads south, where he
            discovers the Oriental culture. He befriends the locals and, in return, they teach William new technologies
            and secrets to take back to his father's kingdom. However, the Sultan is suddenly kidnapped, and his
            aggressive sister takes over control of the Orient. She cuts all friendly relations with George's empire and
            expresses a desire to attack. Having not totally met his needs for resources, George sends both of his sons
            abroad to procure more goods for his empire in whatever manner possible, in order to be prepared for

        <story>Band Hero is a karaoke/rhythm based game, similar to the Guitar Hero games, but directed at the pop
            loving teenage crowd, as well as a more group based party game (unlike with guitar hero, full band
            instruments are included from the beginning of the series).

            The instruments are the same as in the more recent GH games. You have the microphone for vocals, guitars for
            either lead or bass guitar and the drum kits for drumming along. Accordingly, each instrument has its own
            'career' path in game.

            If you are doing the vocals for your band, you have to sing along in time to the music, matching the pitch
            as closely as possible. Lead and bass guitar is played by holding down the fret buttons and strumming as the
            appropriate fret icons cross the strike line on screen. Drums are done similar to the guitars, hitting the
            correct drum pad's/cymbals at the correct time. The better you do, the more points you score, however if you
            make too many mistakes, you will fail the song.

            You can either play alone on any of the instrument careers, or you can play with up to three friends on one
            console or online to compete with other players and bands from across the world.

            Songs featured include Duran Duran's Rio, Don McLean's American Pie, Evanescence's Bring Me To Life and
            Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love.</story>

        <story>This sequel to Battalion Wars plays much like its predecessor, blending real-time strategy with
            third-person shooting. The game's plot traces decades of war among six factions (Solar Empire, Western
            Frontier, Anglo Isles, Iron Legion, Tundran Territories, Xylvania), and unfolds through contemporary
            missions that advance the conflict and flashback missions that reveal its history.

            Players control a soldier or a land, sea, or air vehicle to engage in combat directly and to command other
            units. The Wii Remote is used to target and fire, but selecting and ordering units is performed through
            conventional button presses. The Wii Nunchuk's thumbstick controls player movement, and evasive maneuvers
            are handled through gestures.

            In the single-player campaign mode, the player assumes control of the various factions at different points
            in the conflict's history. The game also features three online multiplayer modes. Skirmish mode is a timed
            two-player match to score more points than the other player by destroying opposing units. Assault mode is a
            timed two-player match in which one player attempts to destroy the other player's resources and
            fortifications while the other defends. Co-Op mode is an untimed two-player match in which both players work
            together to complete special online missions that are not part of the single-player campaign. Offline local
            multiplayer is not supported.</story>

            combat), additional weapon types can be collected on the arena. The player can modify a robot s parameters
            in the single player mode as well as in the multiplayer to fit its possibilities to his/her own fighting

        <story>The Beatles: Rock Band allows players to perform simulated rock music by providing up to six players with
            the ability to play three different controllers modeled after music instruments (a guitar controller for
            lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay, a drum controller and up to three microphones for vocals). Players
            simulate the performance of rock music by using their controllers to play scrolling on-screen notes.[2][3]
            For lead and bass guitar, this is accomplished by holding down colored buttons mimicking guitar frets and
            pushing the controller s strum bar; for drums, this requires striking the matching colored drumhead, or

        <story>The Biggest Loser video game is a fun and engaging way for players to get in shape and maintain their
            ideal fitness. Set at The Biggest Loser ranch, players can take The Biggest Loser challenge and compete in
            4, 8 or 12 week programs against former contestants from the television show, or workout with a friend to
            form a support system to see who really is The Biggest Loser. Players will work-out to a series of
            structured routines with special weekly challenges, weigh-ins and eliminations, or they can even create
            their own workouts. Workouts include upper, lower and core body exercises, as well as cardio and yoga
            exercises. Progress is documented on a calendar that keeps track of in-game achievements, upcoming training
            and weigh-in dates. Players can also receive credit for any progress made while not playing the video game,
            such as going for a walk or a bike ride.
            The video game also features 50 healthy recipes from the BiggestLoserClub.com and The New York Times
            best-selling book series The Biggest Loser to help users learn how to eat right for optimal weight loss.
            Throughout the Wii workout program, suggestions and tips from contestants and trainers will also help guide
            players as they transform their lives via diet and exercise. The video game also features an interactive
            calorie counter that tracks what players are eating and recommends their daily intake based on individual
            goals.</story>

        <story>The BIGS is an arcade-style baseball game that is less focused on the intricate details of the game and
            more on the actual gameplay, proven by the inclusion of power-ups and turbos during gameplay. All 30 teams
            from MLB and their stadiums are included, as well as their player rosters. The Wii version of this game is
            controlled by flicking the Wii remote and Nunchuk. These motion controls include drumming the remote and
            nunchuk when trying to speed up and using the remote as a bat when hitting.

            Instead of a traditional season mode as in many other baseball simulations, in The BIGS there is a mode
            titled Rookie Challenge, where the player creates a ballplayer and tries to lead him and his team to the
            World Series. Another mode, Home Run Pinball, puts a hitter in the middle of Times Square, New York, with
            the aim to hit balls into windows and neon lights.</story>

        <story>The Darkside Chronicles is an on-rails shooting game. In the Resident Evil series it is the second title
            exclusive to the Wii platform. The game s plot revolves around the personal stories and tragedies in the
            series, with its main focus on retelling the events of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Code: Veronica.

            A new chapter called Operation Javier fleshes out the plot further and explains the motives of Resident Evil
            4 villain Jack Krauser. It takes place in 2002 and is set in the waterside village of Mixcoatl, located in
            the South American Amparo. It tells the story of Leon S. Kennedy teaming up with Jack Krauser to investigate
            the connections of crime lord Javier Hidalgo to a former Umbrella researcher.

            Just like The Umbrella Chronicles players do not control the character s movement, but only the shooting
            aspect, shown from a first-person perspective. The player s partner is also shown on the screen and there is
            an cooperative option for two players.</story>

            It is unknown if the game will be released outside of Japan. Scans depict a roster of characters in line
            with the manga and anime storyline, featuring Nelliel, Nnoitra, Ichigo with his Hollow mask and Grimmjow's
            released form, (Pantera) to name a few. The gameplay appears to have been changed substantially, showing a
            split-screen during multi-player fights. It is a one-on-one fighter, but players pick a partner character
            for various team-up attacks and other maneuvers as well as being able to switch between them. It supports
            Wi-Fi play and can be played with the Classic controller or Gamecube controller in place of the Wii-Remote
            and nunchuk. Unlike other instalments before this, it is developed by Treasure Co. Ltd.</story>

            Nintendo DS and Wii.[1]

            Though similar to Mario Kart, the game offers some unique gameplay features, such as a Story Mode (similar
            to the rebooted Need for Speed series), basic car and character customization, and the ability to transfer

        <story>Boogie is a dance and Karaoke game. Unlike most similar games, which use special pads to control the
            dancing, the Wii version makes use of the Wii remote. The nunchuck can also be used to control the facial
            expressions in Strike-a-pose sequences, but is not required. For karaoke, Boogie includes a USB microphone.
            Each song can be played as a dance or a karaoke game. Players either match the rhythm and pitch, or match
            the song's beats to dance. Variation and combos are encouraged, as too many similar moves will lower the
            score. By performing well in the dances, a Boogie meter is filled. When full the player can execute a
            special move. While dancing, bonus items appear such as multipliers, tokens and meter boosts.

            The game features a story mode centered around an intergalactic singing and dancing competition. There are
            five different characters, each with a unique story. For all other modes of play, players can create custom
            avatars based upon the five base characters, with a chapter in the story mode for each of them. Token
            collected during gameplay can be traded in for new songs, stages and outfits. There is also a mode where
            players can manipulate the camera to record their own music videos.</story>

            The game utilizes a realistic physics-based system. Depending on how a projectile is thrown and at what

        <story>Like the original BOOM BLOX game Bash Party is based around fast-paced gameplay that utilizes players'
            reflexes, dexterity, and problem-solving skills. During the action players use the Wii Remote to direct
            objects and forces toward structures made of blocks in order to knock them over. There is also Jenga like
            gameplay during which players pull blocks, with the goal of toppling as many of them as possible, but
            without bringing down the whole structure. In doing this players have to deal with the different types of
            blocks in play. Some of these include: gem blocks, blocks with point values attached, explosive blocks that
            detonate on contact, vanishing blocks that disappear when struck, wood blocks, and steel blocks. In
            addition, as the game progresses strategies may change, meaning that players must be flexible in order to
            succeed.</story>

        <story>The far-off kingdom of Blobolonia is threatened by an evil emperor. An alien blob escapes from
            Blobolonia, searching for help, and he crash lands on planet Earth. There he finds a young boy. Help the
            pair save Blobolonia from the Emperor's tyrannical reign!

            A Boy and his Blob is based on David Crane's Nintendo game of the same name. As the nameless Boy, you have
            control over an alien blob who can transform into different objects when you feed him different flavored
            jellybeans. The transformations are usually based on puns (for example, punch is a hole, apple is a jack and
            licorice is a ladder) or similar sounding names (such as tangerine trampoline and pear parachute). Using the
            different tools that Blob can transform into, it's up to the player to reach the exit door at the end of
            each level.

            Each level also has three hidden treasure chests in it. If all three are found, a bonus level is unlocked.
            The bonus levels are Challenge Levels, which are more difficult, and often based around using a specific
            skill or jellybean flavor. Completing these levels unlocks special rewards such as concept art, videos and
            new game modes.</story>

        <story>Busy Scissors is the first hair cutting and styling game of its kind for the Nintendo Wii and DS.
            Aspiring stylists of all ages, are you ready to train with Bizzy at the Busy Scissors salon? Put your best
            hair forward and see if you can make the cut! Are You Ready To Get Busy? Get ready to color, shampoo, cut,
            blow dry, and style hair with the Wii remote. Players earn reputation and advance their career in a
            Hollywood based salon by meeting the demands of their glamorous and eccentric clientele, from celebrities to
            high-end fashion designers and world famous rock stars! The game progresses as they help unlock each
            client's inner potential by finding their unique outward style. The game features over 30 hairstyles, 20
            mini-games and 6 career levels, which provide a dynamic combination of realistic gameplay, humor, and
            entertainment. Manifest Oranj, the game's developer, spent months working with industry experts to emulate
            the real hair styles used in the game. Each salon technique was demonstrated and filmed by the team, before
            it was re-created in 3D and designed as a mini-game.</story>

        <story>Crafted to be a party game, Cabela's Adventure Camp, like Cabela's Survival: Shadows of Katmai, appears
            as a rather unconventional Cabela's-themed title. Rather than the typical heavy emphasis on hunting,
            firearms, and dangerous animal species, Adventure Camp focuses on the more "outdoorsy sportsman" and camping
            aspects of the Cabela's brand. Here, the only hunting is with a bow and arrow, and the targets are merely
            cardboard shapes of animals like deer--when the targets aren't simple round concentric circles.

            There are six playable characters, all children or young teens who are "attending" a Cabela's-themed camp.
            Hair and clothing colors can be changed, and stats are recorded. Another child, known as Greg, exists to
            grief the player during some points in certain events, which includes things like dropping boulders into the
            river during a kayaking event. Greg takes no active role in the gameplay, rather, unusual challenges or
            obstacles are "blamed" on the character.

            Events in the game include kayaking, skeet shooting, archery, bicycling, and others. Two somewhat more
            "unusual" games also exist, one of which is a form of Whack-a-Mole combined with the memorization of the
            classic electronic game Simon. The other is a variation on Rock-Paper-Scissors called "Bear-Hunter-Ninja"
            and requires the players to stand in predefined stances to pose as a Bear, a Hunter, or a Ninja. Aside from
            the Whack-a-Mole and Bear-Hunter-Ninja games, all the other games have at least two variations, typically a
            different course or set of challenges, and can be played by two to four players. Coins/Emblems can be
            collected in many events, along with large gems for extra points.</story>

        <story>Cabela s Survival: Shadows of Katmai is a departure from typical Cabela s gaming fare in that its focus
            is not on hunting. Rather, Survival is designed more as an action-adventure game with Cabela s-themed
            hunting elements.

            The story revolves around Logan James, a private pilot flying a doctor (Doctor West) though Alaska to
            deliver highly important cargo to an important destination--where people s lives are at stake!
            Unfortunately, sans flight plan and going into a storm, the plane crash lands near Katmai Mountain and
            forces the pilot to venture into an adventure to survive and escape the mountain alive and with their
            important cargo intact. Wild animals such as bears, wolves, cougars and even birds threaten survival, and
            require the pilot to dredge up any hunting and survival skills he has.

            The game is designed to be compatible with the Top Shot Elite gun peripheral, and as such, there is a
            targeting cursor onscreen that the player uses to hunt or even use some equipment, with all the aiming done
            manually with the Top Shot Elite. With a controller, the targeting cursor is controlled in a manner similar
            to a Third-Person Shooter. The player has the ability to perform "Focus Shots" which slow down time and
            allow for visible placement of internal organs of the animal being hunted or defended against.</story>

            installment.

        <story>Carnival Games (known in Europe and Australia as Carnival Funfair Games) is a video game for Nintendo s
            Wii console and the Nintendo DS. It was published by Global Star Software, before GSS was absorbed into
            Take-Two Interactive (and what is now 2K Play).

            Despite poor reviews by most gaming websites and critics, the game was a commercial success. The Wii and DS
            versions of the game have combined shipped over 7 million copies to date,[1] which according to the NPD
            Group, is the third best-selling third-party game on the Wii.

            As a result of the original s success, a follow-up for the Wii was announced, and launched in the fall of
            2008, titled Carnival Games: Mini-Golf.[2] A proper sequel, New Carnival Games, was released on September
            21, 2010 for the Wii and Nintendo DS.[3]</story>

        <story>This is a mascot brawler fighting game bringing together several playable and assist characters from the
            Cartoon Network Multiverse in one epic battle that plays very similar to the Super Smash Bros. series. Up to
            4 players (human or CPU controlled) can control a character and fight on a multi-tiered 2D stage. Players
            may use various items that appear randomly to get the fighting edge over their opponent. Additionally, the
            stage may use set elements in order to take out other players. For example, in the Dexter s Lab Stage
            players can pull 2 different levers, one setting off a conveyor belt, and the other firing a deadly laser.

            When players strike one another, glowing cubes will fall out of them. If players collect enough of these
            cubes, they will fill up their special meter that, when full, unleashes a powerful "Punch Time Explosion"
            (the equivalent of a Final Smash in Super Smash Bros. Brawl) attack against their opponents. For example,
            Ben Tennyson turns into Ultimate Humungosaur and launches missiles all over the stage.

            In the XL version, fighting characters can team up with certain assist characters (the equivalents of Assist
            Trophies) and do Synergy attacks. For example, Madame Foster brings a plate of cookies to the arena, Chowder
            eats them, turning fat, and Madame Foster rolls him around the stage.

            Each playable character has their own special move set that uses different elements from their respective TV
            shows. Each has an up, down, side, and neutral attack. Most characters have a projectile attack. Captain K
            nuckles is the only character who has a disabling attack.</story>

        <story>Chicken Shoot is a gallery shooting game based on free 2003 flash game of the same name. Played from the
            first-person perspective, the player points the Wii remote and shoots all chickens that fly across the
            screen. Different kinds of guns can be picked up and every now and then enemies thrown an egg towards the
            screen that needs to be blown up quickly. Extra points are awarded for shooting certain background items,
            bombs destroy everything on the screen, food can be picked up to refill energy (Arcade) and clocks add more
            time (Classic).

            The game uses hand-drawn graphics. There are different settings, such as the desert and Antarctica, and
            three game modes with different difficulty levels, but quite similar. In single-player, there is Arcade
            (shoot a specific number of chickens), Classic (time limit) and Catch an Egg (a mini-game where eggs need to
            be caught before they drop on the ground). The first two can also be played in split-screen multiplayer.

            such as Scorporilla, Ratcicle, Magamadon and Shellephant. While in control of a monster players can throw

            enemies with a massive scorpion tail - use all of the creatures special abilities to defeat Neo and Nina
            Cortex.

            even toss Aku Aku on the ground to surf, skate, grind and shred.
            Wacky Co-Op Action . At any point in the game, a second player can join in the fun and play as Carbon-Crash
            to help unleash total chaos! In a totally innovative twist to co-op action gaming, Crash can even jack

            In CrashÂ® of the Titans, players will fight a nefarious plot hatched by Crash s arch nemeses Neo and Nina
            Cortex to mutate the local creatures into titanic abominations. Using Crash s legendary mix of outrageous

        <story>Super Smash Brothers takes familiar Nintendo characters such as Mario, Kirby and Donkey Kong, and gets
            them to fight to the death. There are 8 fully-interactive landscapes, with one for each character, with
            noticeable links to their games. Controls are analogue-based, with different moves executed depending on the
            direction and how firmly the stick is pressed. Items like baseball bats, Bob-ombs, and healing items drop
            into the arenas at random, aiding any nearby characters than can make use of them. The game uses a fixed
            viewpoint which scrolls, although characters are rendered in 3D.

            The one-player mode has 14 stages to work through. Up to 4 human players can do battle at once, with team
            play as well as all-against-all action. Hidden characters are thrown in for good measure, as are bonus
            rounds, and a battle to the end with a giant hand (you read right).

            Playable characters include:

            1. Captain Falcoln* (F-Zero series)
            Donkey Kong (Donkey Kong games)

        <story>Welcome to a brawl for the ages, where anything can happen, anyone can show up and all bets are off.Game
            storyline: In multiplayer games, characters from all Nintendo universes meet up in Nintendo locales to duke
            it out. In the solo mode called "The Subspace Emissary," the world of Smash Bros. is invaded by an entity
            called the Ancient Minister and his army of creatures, called "The Primid." Normally, characters come alive
            in the world of Smash Bros. to do battle, then turn back into trophies when defeated. However, the Ancient
            Minister starts turning characters into trophies to harness their power, then detonates bombs that suck
            pieces of the world back into his realm of Subspace. Eventually, all the characters must work together to
            defeat the invading creatures from Subspace - this is accomplished by playing through side-scrolling
            levels.How to progress through the game: For multiplayer games, players pick characters, set rules and
            locations for where they want to play and then duke it out. In Solo Mode, characters play through a long,
            side-scrolling adventure, beating up enemies along the way as they watch short cinematics starring their
            favorite characters.Characters: Mario, Samus, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Solid Snake, Meta Knight, Kirby, Pikachu,
            Zero Suit Samus, Link, Zelda, Pit and Wario, to name just a few. Anyone and anything from a Nintendo
            universe could appear in this game in one form or another.Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Anything
            from a Nintendo game could conceivably be in this game, whether it's a musical score, an obscure item or a
            character that shows up to help the fighters. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is eminently customizable, so players
            can choose the frequency of items appearing, adjust musical scores and basically play the game however
            they'd like. Items range from baseball bats to proximity mines to Poké Balls to Assist Trophies, which spawn
            characters like Hammer Bros. and Sim City's Dr. Wright to attack others.Super Smash Brawl Tournament

            The application tracks player performance using the Wii remote and Wii Balance Board.

            The application also features a selection of diet and exercise tips along with various extras, such as being

            Revolution is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance genre in video games. Players stand on a "dance
            platform" or stage and hit colored arrows laid out in a cross with their feet to musical and visual cues.
            Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to
            choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score. Dance Dance Revolution has been given much
            critical acclaim for its originality and stamina in the video game market. There have been dozens of
            arcade-based releases across several countries and hundreds of home video game console releases, promoting a
            music library of original songs produced by Konami's in-house artists and an eclectic set of licensed music

            new game uses both the famed dance mat controller and the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers, with players
            matching the on-screen arrows with the corresponding footwork, and also using their arms to meet additional
            moving goals.

            This total movement is spotlighted perfectly in DanceDanceRevolution hottest party 4s stunning Choreograph
            mode. This new idea is perfectly designed to appeal to both DDR novices and hardened dancers alike, and adds
            new depth to the classic gameplay. Furthermore, owners of Nintendos Wii Balance Board can use it instead of
            a dance mat, with the board registering complete body movement.

            DanceDanceRevolution hottest party 4 allows up to four players to get together and compete against each
            other, and can be bought with a dance mat controller or a solus title, and enjoys a stunning collection of
            suitably high-tempo tracks. The new game offers 20 licensed tunes, including Lady Gagas classic Bad Romance,
            Paramores CrushCrushCrush and the classic Celebration from Kool and the Gang. There are also more than 30
            specially-created tunes from KONAMIs in-house team, all of which are designed to test the players
            co-ordination and rhythm.

            With a wealth of game modes - including the eternally popular Calorie Counter system so users can watch the
            pounds drop off as they dance! - DanceDanceRevolution hottest party 4 is a stunning party game that
            absolutely anyone can enjoy.</story>

        <story>Gameplay is largely unchanged from other Dance Dance Revolution games. However, the game features
            additional modes taking advantage of the hardware of the Wii. The game allows the integration of the Wii
            Remote into gameplay, where steps can be replaced by markers requiring a hand motion with the remote. Other
            step types include steps which must be hit twice.

            Hottest Party also includes several other modes, including a Free Mode, multi player modes, a battle mode,
            and Sync mode, where several players play the same chart, and only the lowest step judgment on each arrow
            will count. Friendship mode is an opposite, where the highest step judgment is counted. Hottest Party also
            includes Workout Mode.</story>

            Remote with Nunchuk, the Classic Controller, and the GameCube Controller. Players can also customize their

            people. Despite being brothers, both sons have very different personalities; where Edward suggests fighting
            to collect the resources they need, his brother William offers a more peaceful approach, suggesting they
            explore new and unsettled lands to the south.With the agreement of his father, William heads south, where he
            discovers the Oriental culture. He befriends the locals and, in return, they teach William new technologies
            and secrets to take back to his father's kingdom. However, the Sultan is suddenly kidnapped, and his
            aggressive sister takes over control of the Orient. She cuts all friendly relations with George's empire and
            expresses a desire to attack. Having not totally met his needs for resources, George sends both of his sons
            abroad to procure more goods for his empire in whatever manner possible, in order to be prepared for

            Using the unique properties of the Wii controller, players can whip, slice and of course perform Zorro s
            signature â€˜Z slash move to bring his foes to justice.

            The Destiny of Zorro draws inspiration from the Mexican, Spanish and Native Southwest American cultures
            prevalent in California in the early 1800 s . the time of the original Zorro. The multi-tiered story sees
            Zorro confronting the nefarious Calavera and his troops, defeating a plot to steal a great treasure,
            thwarting a power-hungry mob boss, and facing off against a rebel army.

            Players will discover the secrets behind the origin of Zorro himself. The game also carries forward some of

            series, each character has a double jump and a default set of attacks, as well as an ability unique to each
            figure. For example, Sulley can roar to scare others whilst Violet can turn invisible. There are two main
            modes in this game: Play Set[4] and Toy Box.[5] Each play set is essentially a self-contained world with its
            own gameplay, based on a specific movie or series with recognizable characters and storylines. Characters
            from one world cannot enter into another world, but players can put any character together in Toy Box mode.

        <story>Open Season is a riotous romp in the great outdoors, where the rowdy brood of forest animals turns the
            tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters. When a domesticated grizzly named Boog gets lured into leaving
            the creature comforts of home by a fast-talking mule deer named Elliot, he finds himself lost in the woods
            just three days before hunting season. Forced to "rough it" in the great outdoors, Boog goes native,
            rallying all the forest animals to take back their home and send the hunters packing. The Open Season video
            game allows players to relive the movie experience by playing as Boog and Elliot. Throw skunk bombs, hurl
            rabbits, use acorn-firing squirrels and pull outrageous woodland pranks to scare the pants off the hunters
            in this action-adventure romp through the forest.</story>

        <story>Monsters vs. Aliens is based on the animated movie of the same name. During the course of the game the
            player takes control over three characters from the movie which all feature different gameplay elements.
            Missing Link, a mix between fish and human, has to survive levels which are similar to most licensed games
            from animated movies: a 3rd person platformer.

            The sections with B.o.B., a slime monster, are more puzzle oriented. He can swallow enemies or items and use
            them to spit on other enemies. These are also used to press switches and as safety procedure when crossing
            bars - if B.o.B. had nothing solid in him he would just slip through them. With B.o.B. the player also has
            to solve mazes and shooting sequences. The last character is Gigantika, a 15 meters high woman. She uses
            trucks as inline skates and has to avoid obstacles by jumping or mastering quick time events (pressing a
            displayed button in a limited time).

            In co-op mode the second player takes the role of a Dr. Cockroach and supports the main player with
            appropriate actions, e.g. shooting. The player can unlock a lot of bonus material, e.g. concept art, deleted
            scenes (in this case: levels) or audio commentaries.</story>

            life were brought to the brink of destruction, but an alliance of the four races was able to drive them back

            years. In the game world, there are no such things as gas, coal, or nuclear power. Instead, there are many
            different breeds of Eledees, each with their own unique look and personality. While humans and Eledees have
            always lived in harmony, these friendly beings love to cause trouble, and it?s up to players to track them
            down and put an end to their mischief.Embracing the unique functionality of the Wii and Nunchuk controllers,
            the game will allow players to interact with their environment in all-new ways as they search for the
            power-generating creatures. Using the futuristic devices, players can push, pull, lift and throw anything

            gets progressively illuminated as the errant Eledees are collected, with lights gradually coming on and
            power restored as more and more are found.The Wii game also enjoys a very open play system which encourages
            players to devise their own strategy to round up the stray power sources, using stealth to sneak up on them
            or creating noise to scare them out of concealed areas. As players capture Eledees and harness their

        <story>Mysterious and tiny creatures, the Eledees have been the source of the world?s power for the past 10,000
            years. In the game world, there are no such things as gas, coal, or nuclear power. Instead, there are many
            different breeds of Eledees, each with their own unique look and personality. While humans and Eledees have
            always lived in harmony, these friendly beings love to cause trouble, and it?s up to players to track them
            down and put an end to their mischief.Embracing the unique functionality of the Wii and Nunchuk controllers,
            the game will allow players to interact with their environment in all-new ways as they search for the
            power-generating creatures. Using the futuristic devices, players can push, pull, lift and throw anything
            they come across to discover secret hiding places and obstruct escape paths for the Eledees. Each location
            gets progressively illuminated as the errant Eledees are collected, with lights gradually coming on and
            power restored as more and more are found.The Wii game also enjoys a very open play system which encourages
            players to devise their own strategy to round up the stray power sources, using stealth to sneak up on them
            or creating noise to scare them out of concealed areas. As players capture Eledees and harness their
            power-generating abilities, numerous options and additional opportunities unfold to find even more Eledees
            in the ever-changing environment.A new Edit Mode allows users to create levels which can be passed on to
            friends via WiiConnect24. There is also a Multi-Player mode that allows up to four players to compete
            simultaneously and created stages can also be shared within this. Finally, an Album Mode allows users to
            take pictures during the game, which can then be sent to friends via Nintendo?s Wii Connect service.</story>

        <story>Enclave is a third-person 3D action game from Starbreeze Studios

            In this game, set in a medieval fantasy realm, players can choose to take on the role of either a "Warrior
            of Light" or a "Minion of Darkness", complete with separate and unique missions reflecting the nature of
            that decision.

            1,000 years ago, the Dreg Atar armies of the demon lord known as Vatar had all but destroyed the people of
            Celenheim. In an act of desperation, the high wizard Zale sundered the land and created a rift around
            Celenheim, keeping the armies of Vatar at bay. In time, Celenheim forgot the war and forgot Vatar as they
            went about their daily affairs. Now, the rift is closing, and evil threatens the land once again. An
            unlikely hero, freed from prison by happenstance, must rise and fight for Light or Darkness, to either
            destroy the demon king Vatar or kill the queen of Celenheim.

            The end seemed inescapable... Vatar - the Prince of Darkness had won. But a lonely Mage stands high up on a
            mountain ridge, defying the Demon. He lifts his staff high in the air then thumps it down on the earth . and
            unimaginably powerful spells are created, harnessing the infernal powers of nature. The rift caused by the
            Mage s powerful spell continues to expand, sucking everything into a seemingly endless abyss.

            On the one side an Enclave of Light was created, which they called Celenheim. On the other side of the
            gigantic ravine, dark and evil life forms were fighting to survive in the Outlands.However, the centuries
            passed and now the ravine has become narrower. Attacks from the shadow world have grown in number and
            intensity. In these difficult times, vital decisions must be made, and it s all up to the player!</story>

            playing. Firstly, All-Play is for players less experienced, as it has basic controls and the players move
            themselves unless a nunchuk is connected. The other method of playing is advanced play, which involves
            moving the player with the nunchuk and pointing the remote to the player the user wants to pass to.</story>

            movement controls the focus lies on the new, exclusive street matches with teams of five players each. Here
            the player can use bound to bounce the ball - similar to hall matches. This mode has a variety of settings,
            e.g. a wider goal or no goalkeepers. There is even a mode in which the ball directly bounces back into the
            field after a goal. There are also power ups, e.g. shrinking all enemy athletes or a super shot. The career
            mode, in which the player creates his own athlete, deals with the rise of a street soccer player. Experience
            points and team boosts are earned by solving self-directed challenges.</story>

            exclusive to the platform.
            Even though it features the normal 11 vs 11 football match like the other consoles, a new, exclusive feature
            was introduced called Footii Match , which is an 8 vs 8 football match. The object of this feature is to
            beat certain teams from around the world and unlock their "superstar team captain". For the first time, FIFA
            09 on this platform features "Manager Mode" as found on other platforms. Also for the first time ever, users
            can now use GameCube and Classic Controller along with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. There are two methods of
            playing. Firstly, All-Play is for players less experienced, as it has basic controls and the players move
            themselves unless a nunchuk is connected. The other method of playing is advanced play, which involves
            moving the player with the nunchuk and pointing the remote to the player the user wants to pass to.</story>

        <story>Listening to feedback and addressing gamer frustrations has become a key part of the EA SPORTS strategy
            to improve the FIFA franchise on an annual basis.Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper
            intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to
            perfect skills, and a more immersive football experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are
            just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA 10. Three new innovations revealed today have
            been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system
            gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were
            not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the
            defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom
            in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a
            varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.FIFA 10 also
            features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including
            new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player
            growth curves.</story>

        <story>The Wii version of FIFA Soccer 11 is much more action oriented than the other versions. Besides the usual
            movement controls the focus lies on the new, exclusive street matches with teams of five players each. Here
            the player can use bound to bounce the ball - similar to hall matches. This mode has a variety of settings,
            e.g. a wider goal or no goalkeepers. There is even a mode in which the ball directly bounces back into the
            field after a goal. There are also power ups, e.g. shrinking all enemy athletes or a super shot. The career
            mode, in which the player creates his own athlete, deals with the rise of a street soccer player. Experience
            points and team boosts are earned by solving self-directed challenges.</story>

            Revolutionary gameplay innovations inspired by the real-world of soccer make FIFA Soccer 12 deeper and more
            engaging. All-new Precision Dribbling delivers a higher fidelity of touch on the ball for attacking players,
            while Tactical Defending fundamentally changes the approach to defending by placing equal importance on
            positioning, intercepting passes and tackling.

            like its real-world counterpart. When gamers are satisfied with their catch they can head back to the lodge,

        <story>FlingSmash is comparable to Wii Play, in that it is a title published by Nintendo to show off a bundled
            controller. Where Wii Play included the standard Wii Remote, FlingSmash is intended to show off the revamped
            Wii Remote Plus. This is essentially the Wii Remote featuring the Wii Motion Plus technology.

            The game itself is a combination of pinball and table tennis; the player uses the controller to fling the
            ball-shaped character - Zip - into horizontally or vertically scrolling screens of blocks and items in order
            to smash them. Zip changes size and form in various situations, including a heavy steel ball.

            The story revolves around this character, who needs to defend Sutton Island from an invader known as
            Omminus. There are eight regular stages to move through, each hiding five medallions for the player to find.
            Environments include the tops of tropical trees, grottoes under the sea, and beaches. Besides these regular
            stages, there are also eight extra stages and eight bonus mini-games.</story>

            search of companionship.

            Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon is an action-adventure game with light RPG elements and a focus
            on exploring the often desolate surroundings. Players are tasked with navigating the empty environments
            while fighting ghosts and obtaining items such as sketches and short stories that reveal the last moments of
            the lives of those lost in the great catastrophe. Seto is guided through a third-person perspective and the
            flashlight is one of his most important aids. Controlled through the Wii Remote it illuminates dark
            surroundings to interact with the environment and is needed to solve many puzzles. It can also uncover
            hidden enemies and often a sound through the mini speaker provides a hint about their location.

            The Nunchuck is used to walk, sneak around, and crouch. It is possible to go into a first-person perspective
            to get a better view of the environment. Additional weapons that can be picked up during the course of the
            game are sticks, an iron pipe, a bow, a hammer, a bamboo sword, and a katana.</story>

        <story>Free Running is a third-person open-environment arcade game, based around the sport of Parkour.

            Set across multiple high and low rise urban environments, Parkour participants (known as traceurs) navigate
            around and over various obstacles using only the natural abilities of the human body. By stringing together
            spectacular gymnastic style moves, the player builds up 'flow', and is awarded points according to their
            agility and grace.

            In the single player story mode, the players creates a novice traceur, who is mentored by Parkour athletes
            from Urban Freeflow, and by the Parkour guru Sebastian Foucan.

            In addition, there are numerous single and multiplayer challenge modes - races, collection events, style
            based challenges, timed events and more.

            Successful completion of challenges unlocks new levels, videos, clothing, footwear and music tracks.</story>

            owners will also be happy to call on your services for massages for their four-legged friends. Your own
            horse is also in the stall and loves to go on exciting rides through the woods, on the beach and in the
            mountains. Once you ve trained enough, you can participate in numerous cross-country races, and each Sunday
            you can win a cup!

            Show your rivals that by living with horses a dream can come true!

        <story>Gegege No Kitaro : Youkai Daiunduokai est un jeu tiré du richissime univers de Mizuki Shigeru, mangaka
            d'horreur par excellence. L'adaptation vidéoludique du célèbre Gegege No Kitaro, est un party game à la
            sauce Wii. Moins riche que Doraemon, Gegege No Kitaro : Youkai Daiundoukai vous propose deux modes
            différents: D'abord un mode en solitaire où le but est d'effectuer trente cinq mini-jeux classés en
            plusieurs catégories. Ensuite, un mode party-game jouable à quatre, où l'on n'a droit en tout et pour tout
            qu'à une poignée d'épreuves, en rapport avec les catégories pour le mode solo. On a donc des mini-jeux de
            tennis, de foot, de sprint, de course d'obstacle, de lancer et de "pousse baballe", où le but est de pousser
            une grosse baballe! Bien évidemment, tous ces jeux sont ancrés dans l'univers des Yokaï - monstres japonais
            - et vous jouez donc au foot avec une pierre, rencontrez des squelettes dans la course d'obstacle ou bien
            lancez une hideuse grenouille le plus loin possible dans une mare. Techniquement peu abouti - Wii oblige -
            Gegege No Kitaro : Youkai Daiuoukai se démarque par son ambiance glauque et décalée à souhait! La
            maniabilité demande un lourd temps d'adaptation et le jeu n'est absolument pas exempt de tout reproche, loin
            de là : La pauvreté des mini-jeux, l'absence de story-mode à deux, la durée de vie relativement faible et la
            maniabilité laissant plus qu'à désirer font de ce jeu un titre très faible intrinsèquement.</story>

        <story>Greg Hastings Paintball 2 introduces more than 10 single and multiplayer game modes each staged in
            all-new, paintball locations based on actual fields around the world. Seven single-player game modes
            challenge the most experienced "ballers" to hone their skills and then test them against up to 19 others in
            seven different multiplayer game types. Whether playing alone or against others, Greg Hastings Paintball 2
            ups the ante with game-changing weather conditions and field hazards including rain, wind and fog. The game
            also features an improved map editor along with the hottest new gear and weapons. When things are at their
            bleakest, players can even use the all-new cheat meter that lets them avoid elimination by successfully
            wiping away paint splatter before they re caught.

            Serious "ballers" can even become general manager of their own 10-player team composed of more than 100
            professional and amateur paintball players. Gamers can trade players, issue commands, and use their earnings
            from the field to build each player s individual stats, so the overall team is that much more competitive.
            The better the team assembled, the more tournaments a player stands to win, providing him with added cash to
            buy new gear, players and skill upgrades.</story>

        <story>Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game in the Guitar Hero series to focus on specific band, following
            the release of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.

            This title largely borrows from the novelties introduced in Guitar Hero: World Tour, with band career modes
            for single or multiple players with a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the
            possibility to play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a bass guitar, drums, and doing the
            vocals. The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a
            leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a
            second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did
            motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.</story>

        <story>Guitar Hero: Van Halen is the third and final band-specific music rhythm game in the Guitar Hero series.
            As with the previous games Guitar Hero: Aerosmith and Guitar Hero: Metallica, the game features 25 songs
            from Van Halen along with 19 additional songs from selected artists that have been inspired by the group.
            The game was released in retail for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii systems on December
            22, 2009, in North America, and in February 2010 for PAL regions. However, as part of a promotion with
            Guitar Hero 5, the game was shipped to Guitar Hero 5 purchasers in North America prior to its retail
            release. The game was developed by Neversoft with Underground Development assisting Neversoft on developing
            the Xbox 360 port and published by Activision.

            The game has received mostly negative reviews from critics, most of which consider the game s quality to be
            greatly inferior to its predecessor, Guitar Hero: Metallica and other games of the series. The reviewers
            criticized the lack of former Van Halen members, Sammy Hagar, Michael Anthony and Gary Cherone, the limited
            tracks selected from Van Halen s discography, the selection of other tracks included in the game, and the
            general lack of features introduced in the previous band-centric games and Guitar Hero 5.</story>

            fighters at supersonic speeds, firing huge numbers of missiles at vast numbers of enemy planes, tanks,

            ImpactCam, which lets you watch the effects of your destruction up close and personal, avoiding the
            long-distance blip killing often found in other flight games.

            Players take on the role of pilot, Mike Downtown Hudson, who flies for the International Council s Air
            Force. A dictator has launched a terrorist attack - you are part of the response to fight sea and airborne
            enemies in an attempt to avert an international crisis. Missions take place on locations all over the world.

            Heatseeker s arcade presentation includes infinite ammo, huge kill counts, a colourful, saturated look, and
            over-the-top characters and scenarios.

            In the Wii version, players can use physical movements to control the aircraft. The plane can either be
            steered using the Wii remote as a pointer, or with the Nunchuk as a flight stick.</story>

        <story>The fifth game in the Trauma series, Trauma Team expands the series' standard surgery gameplay to include
            five other medical fields. The stylized Trauma interface and Wii controls are adapted to new gameplay styles
            for these fields, while the series' traditional time limits have been removed to appeal to a broader
            audience. The player controls a unique character for each of the six modes, with each discovering a portion
            of an overarching storyline revealed as the game progresses.

            1. Surgery returns from the previous games with few changes. Players must use quick reflexes and repeating
            procedures to perform various operations. The Wii Remote is used to direct the application of various
            surgical tools, from applying healing gel to "pinching" with forceps to remove foreign objects. In 2-player
            co-op, tools are divided between the players, giving each player a distinct "role" in the surgery.

            First Response is similar to surgery, but with a quick pace focused on stabilizing patients instead of
            treating them. Players may have multiple patients at one time, with indicators at the top of the screen
            showing a rough estimate of each patient's vitals. The player can switch between treating patients as each
            one's condition worsens. The death of a patient in this mode is not a game over, and a limited amount of
            losses is considered acceptable.

            Diagnosis requires players to interview and examine patients in an office setting. The player may ask
            questions and order tests in order to identify symptoms. Symptoms are matched up with illnesses through a
            computer interface, with a meter increasing as the likely cause is narrowed down. The ultimate goal is a
            correct identification of the patient's ailment.

            Orthopedics has the player performing skeletal surgeries such as reinforcing bones and replacing artificial
            joints. Each surgery is done in very specific steps, with the correct tool automatically selected at each
            stage. The Wii Remote is used to set bones, screw in metal plates, or hammer in pins. The vitals meter is
            removed in this mode, and players are allowed a limited number of errors (swinging the remote too hard,
            missing a screw, etc) before failing the surgery. Performance is ranked by a running "chain" meter that adds
            multipliers for performing actions without mistakes.

            Endoscopy has the player inserting and guiding a camera tube into the patient in a first-person view from
            the camera. Players feed the tube into the patient by pushing the Wii Remote forward, and must steer to
            avoid hitting the walls of the veins or cavities the tube is traveling through. After locating the goal of
            the surgery (tumors, lesions, etc), the player must select tools and accurately apply them as in the surgery
            game. In two-player mode, players switch between controlling the endoscope and aiming its light.

            Forensics introduces various crime scenes the player must investigate. This mode plays similar to a
            traditional point-and-click adventure, with the player using the Wii Remote's pointer to locate and examine
            clues around the area. Players can also examine victims and perform autopsies. Clues or important points
            take the form of cards, which may be sent off for analysis, or combined with other cards. The player then
            uses these cards (or multiple choice answers) to answer questions regarding the specifics of the crime to
            proceed with the investigation.</story>

            little metal beauties, my collection of plastic tracks and four-wheeled toys began to fall by the wayside.
            Eventually, I was too old to care about the toys.
            To try and hook a brand new generation, Hot Wheels: Battle Force 5 is being beamed onto TV sets nationwide,
            and in addition to the cars on toy store shelves, there s a videogame out for the Wii to make parents open
            their wallets and little Sammy and Suzie smile.
            Pump the brakes, kids.
            If you ve never heard of Hot Wheels: Battle Force 5, I have no idea why you re reading this review, but I ll
            bring you up to speed. Turns out Earth exists as part of a multiverse . an infinite number of alternative

            looking to take over everything (the Sark) and they race around in cars collecting keys so that they can
            shoot through portals into new worlds to takeover. Out to protect Earth and all the other planets from these
            car-driving maniacs is the Battle Force 5, a team of six drivers in five cars that wear these futuristic
            suits and smash the bad guys with rides that can climb walls and transform.</story>

            wiimoteâ„¢) take up the challenge of making you live or relive the experience of real hunting in plains or
            swamps, with an immersion and reality quality never before achieved.

            With your weapon in your hand, binoculars hung around your neck, decoy in your pocket, and a hunting dog
            obeying your every order, move around in beautiful surroundings and get to know each species (whether they
            can be hunted or not) along with their favorite territories, habits and behaviors.

            Proximity, noise, weather conditions and wind direction are all settings that should be taken into account
            when planning to go hunting, while complying with all the hunting laws currently in effect.

            Main Features:
            * A new accessory imitating a real hunting gun (the barrel must be broken open in order to reload it!)
            * The first real hunting simulation on a new generation console
            * 2 kinds of hunting: Aquatic game hut hunting and hunting in plains.
            * Ball-Trap mode in bonus!
            * Set up your hunt according to your preferences: Hunting zones, weather conditions (mist, fog, rain), time
            of day.
            * Be attentive to the wind direction so that you don t alert the game.
            * Direct your hunting dog like you would do in reality!
            * 18 different hunting areas to choose from.
            * 11 species with explanations and advice for each of them: Mallard, coypu, deer, boar, stag, fox, goose,
            partridge, snipe, pheasant, rabbitâ€¦

            demanded he construct a new ultimate weapon for them. Instead, with the help of fellow captive Yinsen, Tony
            built his own ultimate weapon ? a powerful suit of armor that served as the key to his heroic escape.After
            returning home, Tony?s near-death experience drastically altered his outlook on life. The attack against

            despite the protests of longtime familyfriend and mentor Obadiah Stane. And that wasn?t all. Aided by his
            charming assistant, Pepper Potts, and equipped with a new suit even more advanced than the one used in his
            escape, Tony took it upon himself to destroy all Stark weapons in enemy hands ? personally. He became more

            best! It is!

        <story>It is said that when a person dies with a deep and burning grudge, a curse is born. When an average
            housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it
            threatens to kill at a pace thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the
            curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed.
            Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire
            Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their
            individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free
            again. JU-ON: The Grudge is billed as the first â€œHaunted House Simulatorâ€ where accessibility and instant
            scares are given priority over story and game play depth. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, players move
            forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit
            hospital, and a mannequin factory. Much like a haunted house, the player must proceed forward even after

            players to record themselves dancing to songs from artists like Ellie Goulding, Pharrell Williams, and
            Calvin Harris and share in the game. The community then votes on their favourites, which the development
            team will use to create remixed gameplay and ultimately bring fan footage into the game for millions of fans
            to dance against. Ubisoft is bringing the players into the actual game this year.Fan-favourite features
            including the massive multiplayer mode World Dance Floor, video snippet creator Autodance, and sing-along
            Karaoke feature are all back and revamped for the new game.With more than 40 tracks, there's quite literally
            something for everyone. Get "Happy" with Pharrell Williams, "Walk This Way" with Run-DMC and Aerosmith, or
            try "Holding Out for a Hero" with Bonnie Tyler's 1980s power anthem. Whether it's pop, hip-hop, or rock
            you're looking for, check out a selection of Just Dance 2015 tracks: "Happy" by Pharrell Williams "Problem"
            by Ariana Grande ft. Iggy Azalea "Walk This Way" by Run-DMC and Aerosmith "Summer" by Calvin Harris "Holding
            Out for a Hero" by Bonnie Tyler "Only You (And You Alone)" by The Platters "The Fox" by Ylvis "I Love It" by

        <story>Lost in Shadow is a puzzle platforming video game developed for Nintendo s Wii console by Hudson Soft. It
            was released in Japan in July 2010, in Australia and Europe (known as A Shadow s Tale ) in October 2010, and
            in North America in January 2011. Lost in Shadow is played largely in the background of the game environment
            as the player controls a boy s shadow, which must climb the shadows of a tall tower, rife with puzzles and
            enemies. He is accompanied by a sylph that can alter the direction of the foreground light sources, altering
            the alignment of shadows upon which he climbs. There are times in the game when the boy is able to
            materialize into the 3D world and briefly interact with the objects themselves as opposed to simply their
            shadows.</story>

            participating in combat the feels like a mix between classic action battle mechanics and something like
            Monster Hunter lite. Different weapons allow the human leads to change up styles and elemental attacks, so
            you can have a leaf-based blade, an electric gauntlet, ranged cannon weapons and heavier bashing melee
            attacks. As you progress through the game not only will your Spectrobes gain levels, but your humans will as
            well. It s a constant balance of progressing not only your main character, but also all of your monsters
            too. Tie in a search and excavate system for finding new fossils with new Spectrobes and you ve got a
            mechanic that is addicting enough to keep the experience moving; even if the levels themselves aren t always
            the most inspired areas to trek through.</story>

            missing phrase. Other mini-games include a player having to pick a sound effect that matches one four mute

            eating ramen noodles. The game was developed with an emphasis of multiple people playing together.</story>

        <story>King of Clubs is a crazy golf game set in Big Bubba’s run down theme park in the middle of the Nevada
            desert. It features 96 holes, set in 5 different environment themes. Each environment theme has its own
            resident ‘Course Pro’ resplendent in suitably themed fancy dress costume.

            There are 4 single player modes (Career, Tournament, Speed Golf, Practice). As you progress through the
            game, you’ll unlock special balls and clubs which enable you to play different types of shots (e.g. chip
            clubs, swerve clubs, rubber balls, speed balls). Combinations of these balls and clubs then allow you to
            approach holes in different ways and attempt various trick shots to try and get a hole in one (which is
            possible on every hole).

            In multi-player, you can play against up to 3 friends. The multi-player game features specific pickups which
            can help you &amp; hinder your opponents as well as a ‘distraction’ feature which allows non-active players
            to trigger sound effects &amp; rumble the pad of the player currently taking a shot.

            The game also features a ‘Pro-Shop’ where buy various gadgets to customise various elements of the game such
            as the colour of your ball, its trail and even the sound effects it makes when you hit it.</story>

        <story>While walking through Dream Land, Kirby discovers a tomato and decides to eat it. Yin-Yarn, the evil
            sorceror who possessed the tomato (revealed to be a Metamato), appears and magically banishes Kirby into
            Patch Land, a world completely made of fabric, via the sock carried around his neck. In Patch Land, Kirby s
            body transforms into yarn, rendering his power to inhale useless. Instead, Kirby is granted the ability to
            transform by the magic of the Metamato, which he uses to rescue a boy being attacked by a monster. The boy,
            named Prince Fluff, explains that Yin-Yarn has separated Patch Land into pieces, which was tied together by
            magic yarn. Kirby decides to help Prince Fluff collect all seven pieces of the yarn and restore Patch Land.

            Meanwhile, Yin-Yarn captures King Dedede and Meta Knight and places them under his control. Kirby is forced
            to fight Dedede and Meta Knight after they ambush him in Patch Land. When Kirby and Prince Fluff finally
            collect all the Magic Yarn, Meta Knight, no longer under the sorceror s influence, informs Kirby that
            Yin-Yarn is turning Dream Land into fabric. Prince Fluff produces the second sock, its magic fully restored,
            and uses it to transport Kirby and himself to Dream Land; now completely made of yarn. Kirby confronts and
            defeats Yin-Yarn, breaking the spell and returning Dream Land and himself back to normal. Prince Fluff parts
            with Kirby, stating that he can visit Patch Land anytime via Yin-Yarn s magic sock.</story>

            chance the three protagonists Pixie, Madboy and dog Rex got hold of the war robot. They enter it daringly to
            stop the invasion by the inner-earth creatures and, by the way, rescueing hijacked Dr. Samuelson.How does

            earth inside the Krank tank. Sky, clouds, snow, rivers, meadows, scenic villages, weird buildings and trippy
            fabolous creatures all that and then some is waiting behind the massive steel skin.This adventure is
            accordingly developing rich in variety for the heroes Pixie, Madboy and Rex. What?s after all the clou about
            this special weapon, the Kore suit?This brilliant combat suit intelligently adjusts to the respective user

        <story>It is said that when a person dies with a deep and burning grudge, a curse is born. When an average
            housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it
            threatens to kill at a pace thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the
            curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed.
            Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire
            Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their
            individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free
            again. JU-ON: The Grudge is billed as the first â€œHaunted House Simulatorâ€ where accessibility and instant
            scares are given priority over story and game play depth. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, players move
            forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit
            hospital, and a mannequin factory. Much like a haunted house, the player must proceed forward even after
            being frightened.</story>

            of enemy forces. Despite the debilitated state of the mainland, however, a virtually impenetrable last line
            of defense stands proud and keeps hope alive for all the land. That beacon of hope is Lazulis Island, ruled
            by the renowned Count Arganan. With the employment of an army of weapons that magically ?and mysteriously--
            concentrates beasts into a single region, his island has become a small wonder for its powers.

            Among those coming to the island to seek their fortune is Zael, a young man who at an early age was orphaned
            when his homeland became one of the many victims of battle. Though he and his band of fellow mercenaries
            often face disdain and fear as they are perceived to be of a lower class, they manage to catch the eye of
            none other than Count Arganan himself. If they can successfully complete the tasks put before them by the
            Count, they may have a rare chance to gain the most honorable status that they have only dreamed of -
            knighthood.

            It is during one of these missions bestowed upon them that Zael discovers a hidden site, one which grants

        <story>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword once again places the player in control of Link, a Hylian boy who this
            time around lives in the floating nation of Skyloft. Link is in love with a local girl called Zelda but one
            day while flying on their bird mounts, a tornado shows up out of nothing and takes Zelda away from Link.
            After that Link teams up with Fi, a spirit living within a sword and he descends to the long-forgotten
            surface to search for Zelda.

            The game is structured very similar to previous Zelda games: you travel through an overworld in search of
            temples to visit and once in you solve a series of puzzles before fighting a boss at the end and receive the
            next bit of plot. The biggest change is that the overworld is more focused on puzzles this time around with
            only a handful of action. Also new is the implementation of the Wii Motion Plus which allows full 1:1
            controls and new puzzle possibilities.</story>

        <story>Twilight Princess is the first Legend of Zelda game for the Wii and also the last for GameCube. At first
            Link is a simple farm boy, whose tasks consist of herding goats to watching children in Ordon village,
            Link's home town. One day, Link is asked by the mayor to run an errand in Castle Town, but things sudden go
            wrong?

            The land becomes dark, and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm, which
            turns most into ghosts. Link, however, becomes a wolf. After becoming a wolf, Link is aided by Midna, a
            resident of the Twilight Realm. Midna helps Link find a way to turn human again along with other tasks.

            The wolf cannot use a sword or other items. Instead, as a wolf Link must use his senses to solve puzzles and
            get past obstacles. The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. It can push
            blocks with its head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, it can attack enemies by
            biting or pouncing on them.

            As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects
            many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn't before. Link
            performs many attacks with his sword and can even learn other sword moves.

            The game's art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of
            The Wind Waker. Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles and quite a few
            locations from Ocarina of Time can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with
            dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.

            However, the developers modified the storylines to fit the events into 6 game chapters per movie. Barnett
            College, Dr. Indiana Jones teaching location from Last Crusade (Marshall College in Raiders of the Lost Ark

            access to each of the missions, extra unlockable content and options are found in the different classrooms.
            Once a player chooses a mission, a cutscene begins that introduces the section of the movie being played.
            Notable scenes have been recreated from the movies, such as the memorable boulder escape and the battle on

        <story>Lego Indiana Jones 2 lets the player control a Lego figure in areas related to movie scenes and
            situations, with an emphasis on exploration and problem-solving. It can be played solo or by two people
            simultaneously, with the same drop in/out co-op play which has become a staple of the Lego series. The game
            includes adaptions of the original three Indiana Jones movies. These offer all-new levels; none of the
            content has been recycled from the original game. There are also bonus levels that have to be discovered and
            are made using the level creator. Upon finishing these levels, the player can edit them at any time.

            Lego Indiana Jones 2 includes a level creator where players can create their own levels and objects.
            Two-player co-op mode has been enhanced with split-screen; rather than forcing both characters to always be
            close enough to fit on the same screen, the game will seamlessly split when characters wander apart and
            merge into one screen when both players are near each other. The hub has also been redesigned; where before
            each hub was a small area with easy access to levels which had been unlocked, now each hub is a large area
            in which entrances to levels must be discovered.</story>

            as the player controls a boy s shadow, which must climb the shadows of a tall tower, rife with puzzles and
            enemies. He is accompanied by a sylph that can alter the direction of the foreground light sources, altering
            the alignment of shadows upon which he climbs. There are times in the game when the boy is able to
            materialize into the 3D world and briefly interact with the objects themselves as opposed to simply their

        <story>With more Europeans discovering American football every year, EA has embraced accessibility as a key
            feature of its Madden franchise. The previous game in the series introduced motion controls, but Madden NFL
            08 is taking accessibility to the next level ? and brings it online to boot.To make American football an
            easier experience, EA has instituted the Family Play option. This control scheme, which can be turned on or
            off at any time, lets the computer take control of some of the details, letting you focus on the unique Wii
            Remote controls. Much like Wii Sports, players don?t control the movement of the players, only the actions
            like passing the football, evading tacklers by performing a stiff-arm or spin move and kicking. With only
            Wii Remote motions required, it?s a great way to get newcomers into the game, while more advanced players
            can attach a Nunchuk for complete control.Another favourite from last year?s game gets a big update in
            Madden NFL 08: Party Mode lets you pick a Mii and play up to three others in a variety of ways. Play Now
            let?s you quickly take on opponents, Mini-Games offers more than 20 motion-controlled mini-games and Trivia
            allows you to find out who knows most about the NFL. Every game you play affects your Mii?s ranking, adding
            a nice element of competition.For those who like to enjoy the full Madden experience, the biggest addition
            to this year?s game is that of online play. For the first time on a Nintendo platform, gamers can go
            head-to-head in Exhibition games and match up against other American football fans around the world, with a
            live sports ticker keeping you informed up-to-the-minute on scores and updates.? Players with advanced
            American football knowledge can take advantage of the new Read and React System. Player Weapon icons
            identify their on-field strengths and weaknesses, providing an immediate read on what your opponent is
            giving you. Quickly react, create mismatches and exploit opponent weaknesses before every play.? All-new
            player moves, including auto-motion, backward passes and low-hitting tackles, plus ultra-smooth gameplay
            provide the most realistic NFL gaming experience ever.? Like John Madden himself, use the telestrator
            feature to draw on the screen and point out your friends? mistakes when you earn a replay? Take on an army

        <story>Favre is a playable character in every version of Madden NFL 09. On the Wii, he is not on the Jets
            roster, but is available on a historic team, the 2007 Packers. Players can transfer Favre to the free agent
            roster pool, and pick him up on any of the 32 NFL teams for the 2008 season. A roster update on August 12,
            2008 places Favre on the New York Jets roster as their starting quarterback.

            Like all other games of EA Sports' 09 Season, the "All Play" version of Madden seen on the Wii features a
            different photograph of Favre with different graphics and artwork than the other versions of the game.

        <story>Madden NFL 10 is the 2009 installment of the Madden NFL franchise, the officially licensed game of the
            NFL. The game, as with all recent previous installments in the series, was released for all major console
            platforms of the time.

            The Wii version of the game introduces a new accentuated 'cartoony' visual style exclusive to the Wii. It
            also introduces several new game modes and other enhancements, including a new tournament style mode called
            'Madden Showdown' which encourages players to bet on the outcome of individual matchups, a new cooperative
            'Season Mode', and a new passing control system that allows players to pass the pall by using the Wii Remote
            to point at the receiver that they wish to pass the ball to. Another addition, 'Spotlight Moments', focuses
            the camera on pivotal moments in the game and slows down time to allow the player to affect the outcome in
            various special ways.</story>

        <story>Major League Baseball's only cross-console video game series returns to the field with a 2010 release for
            Wii. Once again, a system-exclusive, motion-sensitive control system simulates the real-life actions of
            pitching the ball and swinging the bat. Built on the same engine as the previous year's game, the 2K10
            edition of the MLB game boasts improvements in accuracy and offers new features to give players more control
            while pitching and hitting. The "Total Hitting Control" system allows players on offence to swing for the
            fences, aim for a well-placed fair ball, or foul out of play, to work against the pitcher's stamina in a
            full-count battle. The "Batter's Eye" feature occasionally gives players a momentary preview of a pitch will
            cross the plate, depending in part on the skill and accuracy of the athlete at bat.</story>

        <story>Major League Baseball 2K9 is a simulation of the sport of baseball. The heart of the game is the
            franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part.
            Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics,
            player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every
            player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player's club can fulfill these wishes
            better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to
            the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important
            part to consider.

            Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For
            pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a
            movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also
            influence the ball's direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the
            controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball.
            Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode
            (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards.

            The are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching
            directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls.
            In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming
            system on PSP.</story>

        <story>Marbles! Balance Challenge is a skill-based action title where the player helps an Ant called Anthony
            save his colony via a series of physical tests. Wii Balance Board users can access Marbles! Balance
            Challenge?s 100 specially-created stages where the players steer a ball using the shifting weight of their
            physical movements. This unique way to control the game offers a new experience and combines fun and
            physical exercise. Players can also use gentle movements of the Wii Remote, with steering the ball through
            200 different stages in a quest to locate the mythical ?Golden Sunflower Seed.?As the player progresses the
            level designs grow ever more complex as they introduce houses, snow-capped mountains, deserts, watery
            settings and even a space station. In addition to rolling through the colourful stages, the player must also
            collate parts needed to extend and repair the roads they traverse, which ? when assembled ? give access to
            the game?s final stage. Similarly, other items of ephemera can be collected and used to add new elements
            within the extensive edit mode. Marbles! Balance Challenge includes tough multi-player modes where up to
            four players battle it out in a race to the finish, and an edit mode that allows users to create their own
            stages and share them among friends via the Nintendo Wii Connect24 service. The competitive element of the
            game can also be explored globally, with online leaderboards detailing the best scores for all to see.

        <story>Mario Kart Wii is an installment of the long-running Mario Kart series, but here for the Nintendo Wii,
            where you take control of various Nintendo characters to race through different tracks and win the Grand
            Prix, using a variety of vehicles and items spread through the track to help you.

            There are various additions to the series. Players can now also play with motorbikes, which can do wheelies
            but are lighter and can't super boost, in contrast with karts. There's 6 varieties of each for each
            character class to choose from, and 4 new characters have been added as well as being able to drive with
            your Mii. Finally, there's 16 new tracks as well as 16 returning from previous games.

            Gameplay has also been modified. Drifting has been tweaked so that it's easier to use and players only get a
            turbo boost based on how well they perform the drift. It can be set to Manual, where players press a button
            to drift, or Automatic, where it's automatically triggered on curves but provides no turbo boost. Stunts can
            also be performed in the air to gain turbo boosts. Races have also been bolstered to support up to 12
            players now.

            There's 4 modes of play to choose from: Grand Prix, where you race through series of tracks in the 50cc
            (karts only), 100cc (bikes only) and 150cc (karts and bikes) cups; Time Trial, where you take on ghost
            replays and try to finish in the least time; Versus, where you race against opponents on a single track; and
            Battle, where you can compete against your foes in either hitting them with weapons or collecting coins.

            Multiplayer is also supported, allowing up to 4 players in hotseat and 12 online on Nintendo Wi-Fi, where
            you can take on strangers and friends (with Friend Codes) in any game mode, play in competitions, beat
            other's ghost replays or check online rankings. The game can be played using a Wii Wheel (included), Wii
            Remote, Nunchuck, Classic Controller, or Gamecube Controller.</story>

        <story>Mario and friends are invited to the Star Carnival. Of course, they are thrilled to join. Whoever wins
            the main event, the Star Battle, receives a year's supply of candy. To win they must play through board
            games against each other. Mario and pals can also choose to play a more traditional party (much like other
            Mario Party games).

            In the first Mario Party game for Wii, the basic rules are the same: players still compete to win stars.
            However, the mini-games have been completely revamped to take advantage of the Wii remote. For example, some
            have players point the remote at the screen to shoot guns or other such things. Other mini-games use the
            motion sensor to shake soda cans, cut logs in half, hammer nails in place, paint, fly planes, drive cars,
            etc. There are still others that are played more traditionally by holding the Wii remote on its side and
            using the control pad to move and the buttons to perform actions, such as jumping and/or punching.

            Players can choose between five different modes: Party Tent, Star Battle, Mini-games, Extras Zone, or Fun
            Bazaar. In Party Tent mode, players play on boards with a choice between battle royales, teams, or duels. In
            a Battle Royale, people compete for stars: the winner is determined by number of stars and/or coins after a
            certain amount of turns. In Team Battle, players split off into teams. And in a duel, two players compete
            against each other.

            Star Battle is basically a duel on each board against different characters (for one player). The player wins
            each board by completing a certain task. For instance, the player must collect so many stars on some boards.
            For other boards, he or she has to get to the star with a certain amount of coins.</story>

        <story>Dr. Doom has united supervillains as the Masters of Evil. Now for the first time ever, over 20 Marvel
            superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come
            together to stop Doom. Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel
            across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New
            Avengers provide additional bonuses.

            Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero
            gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which
            can be spent on boosts for your hero team.

            You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on
            foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos
            can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes.

            Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain
            as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.

            The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's
            gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly
            identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.

        <story>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and,
            before that, the X-Men Legends series It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the
            comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills
            hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires
            all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you
            have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another,
            locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline
            you choose.

            You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which
            will give you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the
            game, unless they get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD
            access points, usually at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina
            meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to
            double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These
            can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc.
            Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers.
            Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which
            powers are active at any time.

            Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent
            upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like
            increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.

            The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks.
            This is controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that
            instantly fills the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a
            fusion attack. Any possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic
            types:

            There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a
            single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce
            her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for
            clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting
            their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for
            clearing out scattered enemies.</story>

        <story>Max &amp; the Magic Marker is a physics based 2D puzzle platformer where the player needs to solve
            puzzles by drawing into the environment, forming physical objects that can be used to overcome puzzles. The
            game's protagonist is Max, a young boy who receives an envelope with a marker inside. He draws a monster,
            Mustacho, but suddenly the character comes to life and disappears into Max' drawings. Max chases after him
            and needs to travel through different worlds to halt the villain.

            Max is able to run around, jump, push and pull objects, and climb up or slide down. At the same time the
            player controls a large marker on the screen. To use it, it needs to be filled with ink, which is collected
            through bubbles scattered around the level. At certain passages Mustacho often appears to vacuum all the ink
            out of the marker. Using the orange marker the player can draw lines and shapes into the environment to form
            objects. The possibilities are determined based on the amount of ink available and quick swipes use less ink
            compared to drawing slowly. Using the marker the player can draw steps, bridges and platforms to help out
            Max. More complex shapes are also possible, include shields, objects to drop down on enemies or to use
            seesaw mechanics; offering different possibilities to solve puzzles. Different objects can exist next to
            each other and independent lines can be connected to form complex shapes. At any time the used ink can be
            reclaimed to start over. When the objects are out of view the marker can be shaken to retrieve all of it.

            There are different worlds to explore, each with a unique theme, and every world consists of multiple levels
            with checkpoints. At any time the player can swap between Max' imagination and the original drawings. In the
            original drawing mode the graphics change and time is halted. The latter is also used as a game mechanism to
            pause the game and draw objects without time constraints. Next to the ink each level also holds a number of
            secret items and gel bubbles. Max is vulnerable against most dangers, such as enemies and especially water
            or rain.

            Collected objects open up additional play modes and secrets.</story>

            wide-screen presentation and other enhancements. Each game maintains its original storyline and settings,
            but now Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes lets you use your Wii Remote to aim with precision as
            heroine Samus Aran. Based on the breakthrough control system that debuted in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption,
            these new Wii controls bring an entirely new level of immersion and freedom to these milestone games.

        <story>Apprentice magician Kari loves takoyaki. Looking for a snack, she attempts to summon some, but the spell
            goes wrong and she instead summons a shower of octopi, overrunning the peaceful kingdom of Lonropia. An
            angel appears, informing Kari that she must rid the kingdom of these octopi, and so she sets out in search
            of Prince Exaltus to figure out what she must do.

            Octomania is an action puzzle game where the goal is to remove octopi from your field faster than your
            opponent. There are several nets in each field, each with a number in the center. Place that many same-color
            octopi into the net, and they will turn into bubbles and disappear, turning any adjacent octopi of the same
            color into bubbles as well. Large chains will drop urchin on your opponent, which can only be eliminated by
            clearing octopi next to them.

            The game features both arcade and original modes, which feature slightly different rules. Each mode offers
            one-player story, two-player battle, and one-player endless modes. Also available is network battle play via

        <story>Monster Jam is a monster truck racing game based on the existing TV-show under the same name, which also
            incorporates a series of live events hosted by Live Nation. Unlike previous games of Monster Jam franchise,
            Monster Jam includes 20 pre-existing trucks licensed specifically for the game by USHRA (United States Hot
            Rod Association). The game includes such well-known monster trucks as Destroyer, Bounty Hunter, Blue
            Thunder, Captain's Cruise, it's previous identity - Bulldozer and probably two of the most alleged kings of
            all monster trucks - Maximum Destruction, the winner of seven Monster Jam World Finals and Grave Digger, one
            of the most influential monster trucks of all time .

            At the beginning of the game only a small amount of trucks and tracks is available for choosing. The player
            is encouraged to participate in various events to attain career points which will unlock new items. The
            amount of points given depend on the player's performance in the following events:

            Freestyle - a classic monster truck challenge involves free-riding at the arena performing different stunts
            and interacting with the surrounding environment in the most destructive way possible. In this challenge it
            is advisable to "keep the action going" until the time runs out. Also, a combo of different stunts in a
            succession will result in magnifying the score.

            Track Circuit - an offroad lap-based racing through various types of countryside.

            Eliminator - is the classic knock-out race in which each lap eliminates the last truck to complete it.

            Stadium Circuit - is the same as Track Circuit with the action taking the place in the arena, and not at
            outdoors locations and the trucks competing at different tracks separated from each other.

            Stadium Racing - is a drag racing challenge in which players should boost their maximum speed in order to
            arrive first at the finish of a short un-circled track.

            Once the sufficient number points is achieved the player will be allowed to participate in Monster Jam World
            Finals to prove his right to be the ultimate champion of Monster Jam.

            The game makes heavy emphasis on it's fully destructible levels. Nearly everything player meets on the track
            may be crushed, moved or destroyed. The game encourages such kind of behavior by issuing additional points
            and allowing player to use "nitro boost" for a prolonged amount of time.

            The game may be played in two difficulty modes: "Normal" - is enough for everyone, while "Pro" is meant for
            die-hard Monster Truck enthusiasts only.</story>

        <story>In the third-person action-adventure game The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, players will take on the
            roles of Rick O Connell and his son, Alex (played by Brendan Fraser and Luke Ford, respectively, in the
            film). Gamers will follow the lead characters on their harrowing journey - across exotic locations from
            ancient Chinese catacombs to beautiful, but dangerous, Himalayan peaks - to defeat the revived servants of
            the Dragon Emperor (Jet Li).
            The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor allows players to switch seamlessly between gunplay and hand-to-hand
            melee attacks, and also features a fast and fluid combat system and an arsenal of weaponry that can be used
            to vanquish the many bone-chilling enemies players will face during their journey. Fans of the upcoming
            Universal Pictures film, directed by Rob Cohen and set to hit theatres this August 1st, will fight their way
            through The Mummy universe by utilizing combat, puzzle-solving and hieroglyphic decoding gameplay elements.

            spreads, denizens from the netherworld breach their realm as these malevolent swords summon evil spirits -
            and the Dragon and Demon Gods as well. Featuring hand-drawn 2D art reflecting the heritage and tone of the
            storyline, Muramasa transports plauers into a little known mythology, envisioned by the creators of the
            critically acclaimed Odin Sphere. Players take on the role of a male ninja or female kunoichi, utilising
            their ninja prowess to traverse the clever side-scrolling levels that feature vertical progression as well

        <story>The player is led by a virtual personal fitness coach named Maya (voiced by Yumi Lee, who is also
            credited for workout design and modeling[2]). Prior to the first workout, a player must complete a fitness
            assessmentâ€”the player is asked to record their resting heart rate, then, following 2 minutes of jumping
            jacks, is asked to record their heart rate again. This data is used to approximate the relative intensity of
            the physical activity of completing that set of jumping jacks. This is then used to determine what types of
            exercises Maya will ask the player to complete during her exercise routine. The fitness assessment also
            records the player s self-reported weight and evaluates strength and flexibility.

            Core strength is measured by the amount of sit-ups (a maximum of 40) the player can complete; lower-body
            strength is measured by the number of squats (a maximum of 60) the player can complete, and upper strength
            is measured by the number of push-ups (a maximum of 40) the player can complete. Flexibility is measured on
            a 1-7 scale by how far the player can reach forward when seated with the legs stretched out in front with
            feet flexed. On every 10th workout, the player will repeat this fitness evaluation as a Physical Challenge.
            This results in a dynamic workout program that changes with the player s physical fitness level and ability.
            Based on the results of each Physical Challenge, Maya will suggest one of 5 areas a player can choose to
            emphasize inâ€”Weight Loss, Cardio, Upper Strength, Core Strength, and Lower Strength. In addition to this,
            Maya will also suggest an emphasis for each workout a player initiates. In addition to these workout
            options, the player can choose to do Yoga by selecting the Meditation Garden.

            Once a workout is selected, the player can choose the duration of her workoutâ€”15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45
            minutes, or 60 minutes. The duration is a rough estimate, with the workouts often being a few minutes longer
            due to additional time spent warming up and stretching. The player can then choose a virtual environment to
            work out in as well as what genre of background music to listen toâ€”only a few environments and music
            genres are available at first, but, as the player keeps consistent with her schedule, more are unlocked.

            The game includes over 500 types of exercises, although some exercises with variable repetitions are counted
            as separate in this tally. Furthermore, if the player owns an exercise ball, hand weights, an exercise step,
            or a heart rate monitor, Maya can incorporate these into the program. At certain sections of the routine,
            Maya will stop to ask how the player is doing; the player s selection of one of three replies will affect
            whether the program strengthens, weakens, or leaves the current regimen as it is.</story>

        <story>The game includes three game modes that are new to the series. Naruto s transformation now has three
            tails. Another new feature is the Senzai Ninriki (translated in Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 as Latent Ninja
            Powers), where every character glows a certain colour when they hit low health/crisis mode. Similar to
            gaining new specials in crisis mode as of the first Revolution game and beforehand Naruto: GekitÅ Ninja
            Taisen! 3, the Senzai Ninriki is a special crisis mode that provides certain effects depending on the
            character, for example Naruto and Temari s backward strong attacks no longer use up chakra, Hinata can
            chakra cancel her attacks with no chakra cost, Kakashi deals damage through guard with all his attacks, Neji
            and Gaara automatically deflect projectiles while standing still, certain characters moves become
            unblockable and so on. Most of the characters Senzai Ninriki effects change in Naruto ShippÅ«den: Clash of
            Ninja Revolution 3 onwards.
            One of the game s new modes is the "Hurricane Clash Mode", which is also reworked into the new story mode
            which is original from the main storyline. In this mode, the player controls their character in a full 3D
            movement perspective and can take on hordes of ninja in a beat em up genre fashion, with many character
            movesets retweaked solely for this mode. This style has not appeared in any later Gekitou Ninja Taisen/Clash
            of Ninja games ever since.
            This game was released only in Japan.</story>

        <story>The next release in the NBA 2K series, NBA 2K10 expands previous game modes, brings roster updates, and
            adds a number of new online-linked features meant to add more realism to the game.

            2K10 features an improved player-creation mode that, aside from standard physical and appearance options,
            also includes tendencies, attitudes, dribble and dunk styles, and signature moves. Created players can be
            used in the new "My Player" simulation mode, where the created basketballer rises from an undrafted rookie
            through the entirety of his NBA career. This mode is a simulation in the truest sense, and players imported
            into it must pick a position on their team and are expected to play it accurately, unselfishly, and without
            deviation (no wandering the court in search of dunks and flashy superstardom).

            Xbox360 and PS3 players may download the NBA 2K10 Draft Combine game to create a player and give him a
            head-start on skills in My Player mode. Players can also form online crews and play pick-up games that don't
            affect the character's schedule, but still result in experience points.

            "The Association" sim mode has been expanded, allowing players to control and manage all 30 NBA teams at
            once, follow the realistic progress of generated players, share custom draft classes, and manage new
            developmental league teams.

            Internet-connected consoles may elect to receive live updates through the "NBA Today" feature. This
            optionally updates rosters and stats to reflect changes in the actual NBA (including trades and injuries),
            down to offering date-specific color commentary based on when the game is being played.

            A variety of other gameplay tweaks have been made, including new dribbling and defensive controls, lockdown
            defense, a new stamina system, 24 active play calls, and the ability to save progress in the middle of a
            game and return to it later.</story>

            has two skills, one which is a racing skill (scout, blocker, and drafter) and a non-race skill (fixer,
            mechanic, and fabricator). Each skill has different properties from finding hidden alleys/back streets
            (shortcuts) to reducing police attention. Cars driven by the wingmen are also different; blockers drive
            muscles, drafters drive exotics and scouts drive tuners (although the first two unlockable wingmen (Neville
            and Sal) drive cars according to the player s chosen car class at the start of the game). In career mode,

        <story>Need for Speed: Nitro is an arcade style racing game that emphasizes speed and excitement over realism or
            vehicle tuning. The Wii version allows up to 4 players to race, with a maximum of 8 racers at once. The Wii
            version lets up to 4 racers compete in a drag race.

            Events feature different modes, namely circuits, team circuts, elimination races, drift challenges, speed
            trap challenges, drag challenges and time attacks. Career mode allows players to compete in several cups and
            build up a roster of vehicles, while Arcade Mode lets players immediately jump into a race with customized
            difficulty and race conditions.

            During races, police will attempt to block and ram racers, causing damage that will reduce the players top
            speed and amount of nitro available. The game features power-up icons in the race that immediately repair
            vehicle damage or increase your opponents heat level. During a race, players are awarded "style points"
            based on performing powerslides and drafting, and nitro is recharged over time.</story>

        <story>Princess Peach has been kidnapped! Again! Everyone was celebrating the Princess' birthday when a giant
            birthday cake arrived... but then Bowser Jr. and the seven Koopalings popped out and kidnapped her! Mario,
            Luigi and two Toads make chase to rescue her once more. Will they succeed?

            New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a continuation of the Super Mario Bros. games. As with the original, players
            jump, dash and grab power ups such as the Super Mushroom and the the Fire Flower, which lets them throw
            fireballs at their foes. New powerups have been added too - the Propeller Hat allows players to zoom
            vertically up in the air, and then glide back down, the Ice Flower lets players freeze enemies into icy
            blocks, and the Penguin Suit gives them traction on ice as well as allowing them to belly slide. Yoshi, from
            Super Mario World makes a return, as well - players can ride him and he'll eat enemies and berries in
            levels.

            The Wii Remote's tilting feature is used to activate certain parts of levels - for example, jumping onto
            specific platforms and tilting the Wii Remote will angle the platform too. Another level has players aiming
            a light on a boat by using the Wii Remote so that they're not lost in the dark. Shaking the Wii Remote while
            wearing the Propeller Hat causes the player to fly straight up, while shaking it near objects picks them up
            or throws them.

            The game has a special feature known as a 'Super Guide' - when a player dies eight times in total in a
            level, a special block appears at the start of the stage the next time they play. If the player hits this
            block, Luigi will take over and play through the level, showing them how to complete it. This allows players
            to progress through the game even if they are having trouble on a particularly difficult level.

            Up to four players can play simultaneously. When playing together, as long as one person is on-screen in a
            level, players can keep returning in-game after they die by floating in a bubble which is then popped. If
            all players lose their lives, they are sent back to the map screen. Another mode, Coin Battle, has all
            players versus each other, with the aim being to pick up the most coins while heading toward the goal.

        <story>Designed and developed exclusively for Wii, Overlord Dark Legend is a brand new action adventure steeped
            in fairy tale lore with sinister, satirical twists. Set in a time before the original game (Overlord, 2007),
            players step into the role of a new younger Overlord and revel in command of the most vicious, yet lovable
            little critters in gaming ? the Minions. Forming a unique rampaging army, the Minions are a demonic, slavish
            and loyal horde of imp-like critters predisposed to violence. No matter: they?re always ready and willing to
            follow even the most suicidal order, whether it's raiding villages for kicks and giggles or hurling
            themselves at enemies in the face of kamikaze odds in the beautifully rendered game world. With a story and
            characters that poke playful fun at fantasy cliché, our trainee tyrant will be able to take his growing
            pains out on the local fairy tale inhabitants as he protects his castle and lands.</story>

        <story>PES 2009 for Wii boasts three control methods, with the intuitive 'point and drag' interface of last
            year's game enhanced to make defending and shooting more instinctive. Players use the Nunchuck or the Wii
            Remote to control the player on the ball, while they pick the player to pass to, or send them on runs into
            space. The system has been further refined, so that close control is improved, but two new control ideas
            have also been implemented.Users can now play PES 2009 using either the Classic Controller or the Wii Remote
            held sideways. Selecting these offers a take on the classic PES controls from other versions, with the many
            through balls, chips and shots allocated individual buttons on both controllers. Mixtures of these systems
            can also be allowed during co-op multi-player games, with users opting to use their favored system from the
            user-friendly menu system.Other key advances include the addition of the UEFA Champions League, the greatest
            club competition in European football, as a stand-alone option with all-new introductory elements, and a
            greatly expanded Champions Road mode. Champions Road is an incentive-based game, wherein players are
            rewarded for success in competitions.Players are given individual challenges, each of which is allocated a
            cash bonus. These range from scoring a hat-trick, to string multiple passes together, etc, and the monies
            raised can be invested in improving the facilities at the user's chosen club. Everything from oxygen
            capsules through to private jets can be bought, all of which will help entice better players to the club,
            while the players involved improve their experience stats during matches.PES 2009 for Wii also marks the
            introduction of the Master League, which has proven so popular in PES for other home gaming formats. Master
            League places the player in charge of a lowly team and charges them with building their reputation and
            success through astute signings, good on-field performances and training methods. Every aspect of overseeing
            a club falls under the user's jurisdiction, with success on field used to attract new talent and build a
            team of stars capable of succeeding in PES 2009's many cup and league competitions.PES 2009 also has a
            greatly improved online mode, with up to eight players competing online at once, using two consoles and with
            four players per Wii console.Anything up to four against four is allowed online, while offline allows for
            four players simultaneously. Players can also now use their Mii avatar within PES 2009's Match Mode, and
            within Champions Road. Miis are easily assigned in both sections, and can also be used within co-op matches.

        <story>PES 2010 for the Nintendo format will share the cover stars in Lionel Messi and Fernando Torres. And will
            also boast the extensive additions to the Master League via the integration of UEFA Champions League license
            elements, while the Wii game's graphic elements have been further enhanced. However, Producer Akiyoshi
            'Greyhound' Chosogabe and his dedicated team have also worked to add key gameplay advances to the new
            iteration.Likewise, a decisive addition to PES 2010 is an all-new game balance system that affects both
            attacking and defensive elements of the game. The player in possession now has 'instantaneous stamina' in
            addition to his overall stamina, which prevents unbeatable runs from being used as a constant tactic.
            Overuse of sprinting will have an adverse affect on the player's body balance and their immediate control of
            the ball. As in a real match, excessive attempts of trying to gain possession will drain the player's
            stamina, further demonstrating the Wii game's realism.Proper and timely controls within the context of match
            have also be given more importance. More fine and strategic controls have been given more significance, and
            an attacking player with the ball can perform various 'AI feints' to bypass the opposition defenders while
            dribbling - but is in accordance with the player's abilities. Defenders will also have to think of which
            areas to close down from, and work with other players to reduce the space attackers have.Greyhound has also
            worked hard on a new free kick system, wherein these set pieces are now viewed from the kicker's perspective
            and targeted using a pointer system, allowing users to add swerve and additional pace to their kicks,
            dependent on the taker's abilities. This level of control even allows players to move their keeper earlier
            in a match against human player.New animations will see players signaling for passes, and the slickest
            animation in a PES title on Wii yet, while the Champions Road and Master League modes mark a welcome return
            again. "The stakes have been raised and PES 2010 for Wii shows that Konami can still innovate and surprise,"
            commented Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe. "Our control system for Wii is still regarded as the finest and
            most intuitive around, and we have once again reworked it to add a level of control and realism that can
            appeal to new and old PES fans alike."</story>

        <story>Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 (officially abbreviated as PES 2012 and known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven
            2012 in Asia) is a video game which is the eleventh edition in the Pro Evolution Soccer series developed and
            published by Konami (and MicroByte in Argentina) with production assistance from the Blue Sky Team. Lionel
            Messi, who was the cover star for the series since PES 2009, was replaced by PES 2008 cover star Cristiano
            Ronaldo, while Shinji Kagawa replaces Messi as the cover star for the Japanese version. The US and Latin
            American cover features Santos player Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo. Like previous versions of the game, it
            will be exclusively licensed by UEFA to contain the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Super
            Cup competitions along with a license from CONMEBOL to feature the Copa Santander Libertadores. Referees'
            governing UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Super Cup matches will wear the official UEFA
            Champions League uniforms, which is a first for the series. Primeira Liga were included for the first time
            in series with three licensed teams. On July 28, 2011, Konami confirmed that PES 2012 was going to be
            released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows on October 14, 2011 in Europe and October 6, 2011
            in Japan. At Gamescom 2011 it was announced that the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2 versions would
            follow on October 28, 2011 and the Wii on November 4, 2011. The publisher has also confirmed that versions
            for Nintendo 3DS and iOS formats are also in development, with firm dates to follow. There are two demos,
            both of which were released for the PlayStation 3, PC although the Xbox 360 only had the second demo due to
            problems with the first one. The first is based on a preview build of the game and was released on August
            24, 2011 for PlayStation 3 and PC, though because of "issues on both sides" according to Jon Murphy, PES
            Team Leader, it was not released on the Xbox 360. The second demo was released 14 September on the Xbox 360,
            PlayStation 3 and PC.</story>

        <story>uDraw Pictionary is an art-based video game developed by Page 44 Studios and published by THQ Inc. that
            players can play on the uDraw GameTablet for the Nintendo Wii. The game is based on the popular board game
            Pictionary, in which players draw pictures based on clues from a subject and have their teammates guess what
            specific words the picture is supposed to represent. It was released on November 14, 2010 for the Nintendo
            Wii game system.

            Designed as a multi-player game or party game for all ages, players can choose teams of up to four people to
            play. Since the uDraw GameTablet comes bundled with uDraw Studio, another art-based video game, players can
            familiarize themselves with how the tablet and stylus pen work before playing, as well as how to draw, color
            and sketch on the tablet. uDraw Pictionary includes more than 3,000 clues, with traditional Adult Clues like
            Object, Difficult and Action or Junior Clues like â€œAnimal Housesâ€ and â€œAt the Zooâ€ for younger
            players. The game differs somewhat from classic Pictionary, as the video game has new draw modes. The normal
            Pictionary mode lets users play the game show-style on a 3D game board with a variety of drawing tools,
            brushes and colors to choose from for a livelier sketching experience. Pictionary Mania has a custom game
            board and seven new draw modes, including Get It Straight, Shape It Up, Rotation Frustration, One Line, Ink
            Limit, No Peeking and Off Hand. Free Draw lets players use the drawing tools in the uDraw GameTablet to
            create works of art.</story>

        <story>In this game players will fight through creature-filled areas like a murky swamp, an underwater city, and
            a haunted village to ultimately face-off against the scallywag Rudebelly and retrieve their stolen treasure.
            It's serious business in a game that doesn't take itself too seriously: would-be pirates can ride warthogs
            for "drive-by style" attacks, battle hulking slug bosses and trigger meat meteor showers raining down from
            above. These cute, but dangerous, swashbucklers will take on more than 40 diverse enemies - including
            skeletons, slimefish, mummies and lots of other nasties that want to ruin an otherwise pleasant Caribbean
            adventure. Good thing players have cool combo attacks and a bounty of weapons, from razor-sharp meat
            cleavers to flaming axes, to ensure that mowing down monsters never gets old! Players can also use the
            environment to their advantage by picking up rocks and barrels to hurl or simply snatching up the baddies
            themselves to toss them overboard. As players progress, they'll gain XP points that will earn them perks and
            upgrades that will cause more damage to enemies. In addition, Pirates PlundARRR lets 4 mates plunder
            together for co-op, beat-em action!</story>

        <story>One of the biggest names in boxing returns after a 15-year hiatus. In Punch-Out!! you play as young
            up-and-coming fighter Little Mac who, with the help of his ringside trainer Doc Lewis, is working his way
            through the ranks of a wide variety of boxing caricatures, each with their own patterns of attacks. Grab a
            Wii Remote controller in one hand and a Nunchuk controller in the other and step back into the ring with a
            modern update of the classic Punch-Out!!Little Mac Is BackEveryone?s favorite underdog from the 1980s joins
            the best of the original Punch-Out!! cast in a modern re-imagining of the series. Players will find familiar
            names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D,
            complete with hilarious fighting animations and back stories that capture all the fun and flair of the
            original Punch-Out!! games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean
            that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and
            jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk
            controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played
            with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!! features a total of
            13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in the
            Punch-Out!! series. Each has their own back story and patterns of attacks to learn and learns to counter.
            Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a
            young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on
            working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass
            Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good
            warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but
            can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if
            you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left
            him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail
            if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little
            Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single
            punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!! features multiple controller options. For
            players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities, Punch-Out!! uses the Wii Remote
            and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii
            Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has
            also included the option to play Punch-Out!! using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use
            the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.</story>

        <story>Puzzle Kingdoms is a RPG game using tile matching mini-games as the combat system of the battles, in a
            similar fashion to Puzzle Quest, another puzzle-based RPG with fantasy themes released in 2007 by the same
            developers. Instead of swapping adjacent tiles to create groups of three or more like in the earlier title,
            the main gameplay mechanic this time is to move columns and rows to match tiles.

            The player controls a hero character, moving between waypoints in an isometric map similar to the ones found
            on the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade
            and defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically
            after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.

            The battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two
            fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the combatants take
            turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the
            damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up
            at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar
            effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid.

            The troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the
            alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can
            retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved.
            There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific
            tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of
            their colors.

            New troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines,
            taverns, dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on
            a set number of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges.
            Completing these bonus stages gives new items and upgrades.</story>

            and Wordsearch. In Fitword, the words shown must be placed in a grid. In Crossword, clues are given and the

            way that no duplicates occur horizontally and vertically. In Wordsearch, the words shown have to be crossed
            out in a grid of letters.

            There are several game modes and difficulty levels to choose from. The Nintendo DS is held like a book
            during gameplay, and the player can either play lefthanded or righthanded (which determines on which side
            the player holds the Touch Screen).

            The game has five game modes which include:

            1. Simply Puzzle, this lets the player pick any type of puzzle for a quick challenge without keeping score.
            2. Quick Blast, which offers a number of puzzles based on the amount of time the player has. This can be set
            to show up daily, for instance for a daily bus trip.
            3. Fast &amp; Fun, which adds a timer to increase pressure on the player.
            4. Head to Head, a two-player challenge.
            5. Tournament, in which the player solves a series of puzzles increasing in difficulty from Easy to Pro.

            In the European version, all puzzles are localized.</story>

            Party.

            All three games in the collection have a simple plot line of Rayman either imprisoned or escaping the
            Rabbids, silly looking rabbit creatures. The first game starts off with Rayman being kidnapped while at a
            picnic and Rabbids have him endure many types of tests that the player must complete in order for him to be
            set free. The next game features Rayman entering a mall trying to attack the angry Rabbids that have
            captured him in the previous game. In TV Party, he is running away from the Rabbids and discovers that a
            bolt of lightning has transferred the Rabbids into a TV set, which is the premise for the mini games.

            published by Conspiracy Entertainment.
            The player, controlling a firefighter who the fellow firefighters refer to as Probie, uses a hose and fire
            extinguisher to fight flames, a halligan to pry open locked doors and vent coverings, and a fire axe to
            destroy obstacles. The player will work with at least one other firefighter with an extinguisher in some
            areas though in others, he is alone. The player has objectives to complete such as rescuing civilians or
            other firefighters, extinguishing all fires in an area, disabling something that causes the fire to spread,
            and more. The player will fail the mission and be forced to restart the mission from beginning or checkpoint
            if he stands too close to the fires for too long, getting electrocuted by being to close or using the hose
            on exposed electricity, and failing a mission objective. The player fights fires in an industrial park, a
            shopping mall, a neighbourhood, a tower, a museum, a robotics research facility, a bridge, and an amusement
            park.</story>

            series, with its main focus on retelling the events of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Code: Veronica.

            A new chapter called Operation Javier fleshes out the plot further and explains the motives of Resident Evil
            4 villain Jack Krauser. It takes place in 2002 and is set in the waterside village of Mixcoatl, located in
            the South American Amparo. It tells the story of Leon S. Kennedy teaming up with Jack Krauser to investigate
            the connections of crime lord Javier Hidalgo to a former Umbrella researcher.

            Just like The Umbrella Chronicles players do not control the character s movement, but only the shooting
            aspect, shown from a first-person perspective. The player s partner is also shown on the screen and there is

        <story>Rock Band 2 is the sequel to the 2007 musical simulation game Rock Band and offers similar gameplay.
            Directly competing with Guitar Hero: World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a
            band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set.

            The new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and
            older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has
            five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch
            to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided
            in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the
            pitch.</story>

        <story>Rock Band 3 is the third game in the main Rock Band series, and features numerous new additions to the
            original game. As with previous games in the series, players form a band (of up to seven players) and
            perform a song together using guitar, bass, drums, vocals (solo or harmonies) and new to this game,
            keyboard. By working together, players can maximise their scores. Each player can fill a power bar by
            performing special sets of notes. When they have enough of these, they can activate "Overdrive" which adds a
            x2 multiplier for each player that has Overdrive activated simultaneously (so, for example, having four
            players with Overdrive activate will score you x8 rather than x2 for only one person).

            Vocal harmonies, first introduced in The Beatles: Rock Band, are carried over into the main Rock Band series
            for the first time. Up to three players can perform on the microphone, with one player performing the lead,
            and the remaining players performing backing vocals. By keeping in harmony with each other, players can earn
            double or triple score, depending on how many players can keep up. The game also introduces a new style of
            play for each of the instruments, "Pro Mode". Pro Mode is more accurate to actual instruments for those
            players who are looking for an even greater challenge - guitars have multiple buttons on the fret board and
            players must actually strum strings, the drums must have the three cymbal attachment, while with the
            keyboard, even more keys are used so that the performance is much closer to actual play.

            The Career Mode of the game has also been revised for this game. Rather than grinding to earn money to
            unlock new items, the game is instead based around Achievement-like "goals". Each goal you unlock earns you
            more fans for your band, and often unlocks new items of clothing or instruments. All songs are initially
            unlocked so that those who just want to play for fun can, while those looking for a deeper experience can
            tackle the "Road Challenge" mode, which has you travelling to different venues and performing song sets.
            Each star you earn for a song gets transformed into "Spades" at the end of the performance, and the more
            Spades you earn, the more goals you unlock which again translates into even more fans and items. Bonus
            Spades can be earned by performing the requested tasks at the start of each song, such as continuously
            deploying Overdrive, performing note streaks while you're in the spotlight, or deploying Overdrive when full
            and then performing note streaks.</story>

        <story>A planned attack on Nu Earth goes wrong when a General turns traitor resulting in the massacre of Rogue s
            comrades.

            The game starts with Rogue and his comrades launched from a drop-ship. They come under fire from the Norts
            due to the information that had been leaked by the General. Upon landing the first mission is a tutorial in
            how to use Rogue s skills and also the Bio-chips of Gunnar and then Bagman. The third Bio-chip of Helm is
            received in a later mission. The Bio-chips have their own abilities. Gunnar is stuck to the side of Rogue s
            rifle and can be used as a sentry while Rogue flanks the enemy. Bagman provides ammunition and upgrades for
            Rogue s equipment made from salvage collected along the way and also looks after his health. Helm is used
            for accessing computer consoles and panels allowing Rogue access into prohibited areas.

            Rogue works his way through the various levels as stealthily as is possible trying to take the Norts by
            surprise with kill moves but with the arsenal at his disposal he is quite capable of also unleashing hell
            and going toe to toe with the enemy. Tracking the traitor General, Rogue eventually catches up in the final
            mission with an abundance of Norts trying to stop him.</story>

            foil the Meemoo s corrupt plans by putting to work a combination of quick thinking and quick reflexes.

            As Magical Meteors fall to Roo s surface, your job is to rotate floating land masses with the L and R
            Buttons of your DS, clearing the way for the meteors to arrive safely. Not only will you have to make sure
            these floating land masses are aligned correctly to get the Magical Meteors through, you ll also have to
            account for obstacles and enemies determined to throw a spanner in the works. As you progress through the
            game, the meteor blocks will begin to come thick and fast . making the task of saving Roo trickier by the
            minute!

            3D environments that span both screens of your DS. And if you re looking for an extra challenge, there is a

            your DS to your Wii to unlock an offering of taxing new puzzles in both games.

            Further adding to the longevity of Roogoo Attack! are six different multiplayer modes that invite you to
            compete against friends even if they don t own a copy of the game. Whether you compare your meteor
            manipulation skills in Meemoo Attack, Anvil Attack, Air Mine or one of the other challenges on offer, you ll
            have to think even faster than usual to get the best of up to three other opponents.

            Solve puzzles with high stakes in Roogoo Attack! The future of Roo depends on you!

        <story>RTL Biathlon 2009 is a simulation of the Biathlon sport. Like the real sport it is basically divided into
            two sections: skiing and shooting. During the skiing sections the player steers his athlete into the correct
            direction and watches his stamina. In the middle of the screen is a power bar which gets filled by holding
            the assigned button - if the bar is too low the athlete gets slow and if it is too high he gets tired.
            Practically this results in steady button pressing to keep it as high as possible. During the shooting
            sequences the player shoots on targets while the cursor is wobbling. He can also hold his breath for a short
            time to steady his aim.

            In the career mode the player divides points into four categories, e.g. speed or stamina, which influence
            the athlethe's capabilities. After successful championships he can improve these stats further. New in this
            instalment are super-powers which can be chosen at some point. When activated these give a big boost on a
            stat for a short time, e.g. "mountain skiing" boosts power when skiing uphill. These are available once per
            race. There are overall 15 courses which are partly licensed.</story>

            crops. Examples include: Strawberries and turnips in the spring, tomatoes and pineapples in the summer, and
            yams in the fall. There are many other crops, and you can grow flowers, which can all be sold for gold (the
            game's currency.) Farming is only half of the game. The other half is dungeon crawling. There are four very
            different dungeons, three of which represent the four different seasons (the third dungeon represents both
            autumn and winter). In these dungeons, crops of that dungeon's seasonal affiliation can be grown. The fourth
            dungeon, Whale Island, is omni-seasonal, and all crops can be grown there at any time.</story>

            their deceased relative, oil tycoon and billionaire Duncan Adams, hidden somewhere within his luxurious

            Exploration of the mansion is performed entirely by mouse in point-and-click fashion. As you dig for clues
            and puzzles to solve, you can view the environment in 360 degrees. An in-game mapping system records your
            progress by marking discovered puzzles with a red X , which turns green when solved.

            There are a total of 35 different safes to open which will eventually lead you to the 36th "Master" safe.
            The puzzles are not only about turning dials and pushing buttons. There are sliders, some based on
            mathematics, pattern recognition puzzles, marble mazes, and some based on inventory objects, for instance.

        <story>Sakura Wars is a Strategy RPG that features a unique sim-based story system. An in-depth storyline
            exists, much like in any other RPG; however, the player s destiny in the game is not predetermined.
            Character interaction plays a major role, and your responses to the various characters in the game can
            ultimately change the story content and even the final outcome. The battle system is divided into two main
            parts; ground combat and air combat. Ground combat takes place using two-legged mechanized suits, which
            transform into jet fighters to take the fight to the sky. Every mech unit in the game can transform from
            battle mech mode to jet fighter mode during combat. Once transformed, weapons and movement methods will
            change as well. For example, the hero s ground mode utilizes a sword as his main weapon, but in jet mode he
            will use long-range missiles.</story>

        <story>Named after the television boxing program airing on the US Showtime cable network, this game offers a mix
            of fourteen heavyweights and welterweights and four arenas to fight in (New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and
            Chicago). Basic moves include upper block, body block, dodging left and right, short punches and powered
            punches (hook, jab, uppercut, bodyshot). While playing, there are a few parameters to take into account.
            First there is a health meter that recharges when the boxer dodges hits for some time. Punches need to be
            thrown strategically, as an energy bar determines the effectiveness. Too many punches deplete the bar and
            the amount also determines if a boxer will be able to get up when knocked down. A round timer and knockdown
            lights are also shown. At certain times, a power-up indicator will become available. This allows a boxer to
            charge a heavy punch, but the opponent will have time to react. When the charging takes too long, the punch
            is lost.

            The different game modes (different for heavyweight and welterweight) include:

            1. Single Fights (Quick): fight for only one round until one of the boxers is knocked out.

            2. Single Fights (Regular): play for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rounds and choose to decide it by a KO, TKO or by
            points.

            3. Points System: after each round each boxer is awarded points based on performance. At the end of a fight,
            or after a KO or TKO, the player with the most points wins.

            4. Belts: series of three (Amateur), four (Contender) or six (Showtime) fights. Each fight lasts four rounds
            or three minutes and the aim is to win one of the belts.

            5. King of the Ring: one boxer takes on all other boxers in his weight division in one long round.

            Additional fighters are unlocked by winning competitions. Most of the modes can also be played with two
            players through a wireless connection (DS).</story>

        <story>Pirates! is a single-player, open-world game. The player receives a letter of marque authorizing service
            as a privateer for the Spanish Empire, the Dutch Republic, the Kingdom of England, or the French colonial
            empire in the Caribbean. The player's loyalties may change over the course of the game; they may also hold
            rank with multiple countries and may turn to piracy at any time. Gameplay is open-ended; the player may
            choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members,
            or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase their wealth through trade. The game also has no
            predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. As the
            player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the
            character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point they are given a position
            in their future life, from beggar to King's adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital
            status, and other accomplishments.</story>

            her life. Especially not today: the 17-year-old American beauty is on a luxurious Atlantic cruise with her

            In a frantic battle to the checkered flag, Sonic and friends speed around tracks set in medieval castle
            ramparts, lush rainforests and bustling cities, all taken from the visually rich and varied universes of
            Sonic and SEGA. Fan favorites such as Dr. Eggman, Tails, AiAi, Amigo and many more will join Sonic in their
            custom built vehicles, revving their engines and jostling to stay ahead of the pack. Each character will
            speed around the track in cars, planes, motorbikes, and in Aiai's case ? a banana mobile! Secret short cuts,
            swift handling and avoiding strategically placed obstacles are certainly the best way to get to the top of

        <story>Spectrobes mixes monster battling with a real-time action RPG experience, so you ll not only be managing
            which critter is out on the field and attacking, but also running your main character around and
            participating in combat the feels like a mix between classic action battle mechanics and something like
            Monster Hunter lite. Different weapons allow the human leads to change up styles and elemental attacks, so
            you can have a leaf-based blade, an electric gauntlet, ranged cannon weapons and heavier bashing melee
            attacks. As you progress through the game not only will your Spectrobes gain levels, but your humans will as
            well. It s a constant balance of progressing not only your main character, but also all of your monsters
            too. Tie in a search and excavate system for finding new fossils with new Spectrobes and you ve got a
            mechanic that is addicting enough to keep the experience moving; even if the levels themselves aren t always
            the most inspired areas to trek through.</story>

        <story>Spider-Man: Edge of Time is a follow-up to Shattered Dimensions, and similarly it has more than one
            Spider-Man takes a starring role. Here, it is the regular, classic "Amazing" Spider-Man, and Spider-Man 2099
            . in a story awash in time travel, temporal battles, and Anti-Venom.

            The backbone of this story seems to play out more like a Spider-Man 2099 story, since he is the only
            character truly aware of the happenings in the game, and the changes that both Spider-Men encounter. From
            the opening, things are bleak for Amazing Spider-Man who begins the game nearly dead, and 2099 is the only
            one who can help. A new villain Walker Sloan enters the picture with a plan to rebuild the past (from the
            year 2099) in his image and design, which turns to affect both Spider-Men. From this point, chaos unfolds in
            typical comic-book fashion with gameplay evenly split between Amazing Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2099, with
            every other level interwoven with the events of one Spidey to the other.</story>

            enemy force and one-by-one, the villains begin disappearing. Meanwhile, Spider-Man is rescued by Nick Fury
            of S.H.I.E.L.D., who informs him that the meteor which brought the Venom symbiote to Earth had broken up in
            the Earth s atmosphere and five more pieces had landed in numerous locations across the globe. Fury sends
            Spider-Man to retrieve the shards of meteors. Spider-Man quickly finds that the villains who attacked him
            and several more of his foes, including Rhino and Scorpion, have been placed under mind control of a
            mysterious villain. The villain also creates and controls holographic/symbiote combination foot soldiers
            called P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s (short for Perpetual Holographic Avatar Nano-Tech Offensive Monsters). As Spider-Man
            fights his enemies one-by-one and rescues them from the mind control, they promise to aid him in finding the
            villain responsible. As Spider-Man progresses, he obtains more allies such as Black Cat, Iron Fist, Lizard
            (not portrayed as a villain), and Blade. He discovers that the evil genius is Mysterio, who intends to use
            his army to take over the world, using each shard of the meteor to make them stronger. Spider-Man decides to
            temporarily don the Black Suit for the final battle.</story>

            within the game's Open mode where up to four people can compete in variations of CPU and human users, while
            a Tournament option lets four human and four CPU players battle it out in an ongoing competition.As with its

            The Clone Wars which is the pilot for a TV series of the same name. The story is set between Episode II and
            III in which the player takes the role of either Obi-Wan, Anakin or Ahsoka Tano. During the course of the
            campaign he has to win one-on-one lightsaber battles against enemies like Count Doku.

            The controls are designed for the unique Wii controls which means the player needs to swing his Wii remote
            with the correct timing and the game converts it into in-game fighting moves. If the player performs certain
            hit combos which are different for every character the force meter fills up which can be used to hit the
            enemy with powerful force attacks. From time to time there is a quicktime event if the two sabers are in

        <story>Mario takes to the skies and beyond in another outing to save the Princess. As the Mushroom Kingdom
            prepares to celebrate the arrival of a comet that appears in the skies every hundred years, Princess Peach
            sends Mario an invitation to attend. As Mario arrives, Bowser and minions attack the Kingdom and once again
            kidnap the Princess... and her entire castle. Mario gives chase but is lost as the ship leaves the
            atmosphere and ends up on a space station built on the visiting comet overseen by the mysterious Rosalina.
            It's up to Mario to brave new galaxies, find the elusive Power Stars, and bring his friends home.

            Super Mario Galaxy plays similarly to Super Mario 64, as Mario explores his latest 3D world defying gravity,
            crossing various terrains, and even running upside down across the planet surfaces. Bouncing from planet to
            planet, Mario must collect Star Bits and coins, using his usual jump attacks and spins (now controlled with
            movement from the Wii Remote). The Wii Remote is also used to collect out of reach Star Bits and also can be
            controlled by a second player.

            In addition, Mario can find new suits (similar to Super Mario Bros. 3) that give him the ability to turn
            into the ghostly Boo Mario, the high-flying Bee Mario, launch fireballs as Fire Mario and skate across
            frozen lakes as Ice Mario. New challenges also await Mario including ray surfing, balancing on a high-speed
            ball, floating inside bubbles, and other challenges in his quest to get all 120 stars. Even Luigi lends a
            hand in the search, making valuable contributions to the adventure.

            Players can also take a snapshot of the worlds they've completed along with their best record times and send
            them to their friends via Wi-Fi.</story>

        <story>Mario returns to the stars as the everlasting villain Bowser has kidnapped Princess Peach once more. This
            time while she was baking a cake...
            Once again Mario is determined to fight Bowser and free Princess Peach.

            The basic goal of each level is to collect the golden star. The environment is still a mixture of standard
            Mario stages and miniature planetoids with their own orbital gravity. Throughout the game the perspective is
            changed at some stages, switching from 3D to 2D. The 2D part is similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii.

            Super Mario Galaxy 2 features a further improved experience over its predecessor, with two new suits for
            Mario and the return of Yoshi. Mario's first new suit is the Cloud Suit, which allows him to create three
            safe but temporary platforms. The second new suite is the Rock Suit. While wearing it, Mario can roll up
            into a ball which will be necessary to complete some challenges.
            For the first time in the franchise Yoshi will be able to wear a suit as well. By finding it, he will become
            "Light Yoshi" that allows him to see certain platforms that are otherwise invisible.

            Like in the original Super Mario Galaxy a second player can join the experience by pointing the Wii Remote
            on the screen to collect coins. What is new to the game however, is that the second player now also can
            collect items that are out of the reach of Mario.

            To aid the entry for people new to the franchise, the game features an introduction to the game play and
            controls of the game.</story>

        <story>The single-player puzzle levels in Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz have been designed to challenge
            gamers' skills like never before. For the first time in the Super Monkey Ball franchise, AiAi and his
            friends have the ability to jump when players flick the Nintendo Wii controller in an upward motion. The
            ability to jump has given game designers another dimension in which to expand the Super Monkey Ball gameplay
            experience and allows gamers a whole new way to interact with the franchise; this time in true
            three-dimensional fashion. The Party Games return with more variety than ever. An abundance of new Party
            Games have been designed to take advantage of the Wii controller in a multitude of ways. Gamers find
            themselves competing in a traditional game of ring toss, or even smacking pesky moles in a game of
            "Whack-a-Mole."</story>

        <story>In this action-platformer, Bowser and Peach find themselves at the wedding altar, forced into marriage by
            the evil Count Bleck. With this union, a void will engulf the entire universe as foretold by the book, the
            Dark Prognosticus. Before Luigi can stop Count Bleck, the villain escapes with an item known as the Chaos
            Heart. However, there is another book, called the Light Prognosticus, which can counteract the Dark
            Prognosticus. The Light Prognosticus foretells of a hero dressed in overalls. This hero is believed to
            possess the power to stop certain destruction of the universe.

            Mario, joined by Peach, Bowser, and a new group of friends, must travel through eight worlds in search of
            Pure Hearts. Each character has a special ability, which can help the player solve the game's many puzzles.
            Mario can flip between the second and third dimensions in order to find items, secret pathways, and pound
            enemies. Peach can use her parasol to float long distances and to defend against enemy attacks. Bowser uses
            his fire breath to light things and to fry enemies.

            Super Paper Mario does not fully depart from its RPG roots. For instance Mario and friends receive points
            from baddies. These points allow Mario and company to level up. Items can also be used to attack enemies or
            gain lives. Players collect coins to pay for more items.

            Players can shake the Wii remote after jumping on bad guys but before hitting the ground to gain extra
            experience points. Players use Tippi, a Pixl, allowing them to point the remote at the screen to find
            secrets. Other Pixls, who help in other ways, can be found along the way. Pixls besides Tippi can be used by
            pressing the 1 button.</story>

        <story>Welcome to a brawl for the ages, where anything can happen, anyone can show up and all bets are off.Game
            storyline: In multiplayer games, characters from all Nintendo universes meet up in Nintendo locales to duke
            it out. In the solo mode called "The Subspace Emissary," the world of Smash Bros. is invaded by an entity
            called the Ancient Minister and his army of creatures, called "The Primid." Normally, characters come alive
            in the world of Smash Bros. to do battle, then turn back into trophies when defeated. However, the Ancient
            Minister starts turning characters into trophies to harness their power, then detonates bombs that suck
            pieces of the world back into his realm of Subspace. Eventually, all the characters must work together to
            defeat the invading creatures from Subspace - this is accomplished by playing through side-scrolling
            levels.How to progress through the game: For multiplayer games, players pick characters, set rules and
            locations for where they want to play and then duke it out. In Solo Mode, characters play through a long,
            side-scrolling adventure, beating up enemies along the way as they watch short cinematics starring their
            favorite characters.Characters: Mario, Samus, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Solid Snake, Meta Knight, Kirby, Pikachu,
            Zero Suit Samus, Link, Zelda, Pit and Wario, to name just a few. Anyone and anything from a Nintendo
            universe could appear in this game in one form or another.Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Anything
            from a Nintendo game could conceivably be in this game, whether it's a musical score, an obscure item or a
            character that shows up to help the fighters. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is eminently customizable, so players
            can choose the frequency of items appearing, adjust musical scores and basically play the game however
            they'd like. Items range from baseball bats to proximity mines to Poké Balls to Assist Trophies, which spawn
            characters like Hammer Bros. and Sim City's Dr. Wright to attack others.Super Smash Brawl Tournament

        <story>The first Super Swing Game (or better known as Pangya in Japan and Korea) and has a feel of Hot Shots
            Golf. While based off the Pangya series from Japan, this version's system has been totally revamped for the
            Wii's control scheme, utilizing the Wii Remote for swinging and putting. The player has ten different
            courses to play on, ranging from simple lush and green tees to a wind tunnel no less and can choose from
            eight different characters, each with their own story-line if the player chooses the Story Mode.

            There is also multiplayer modes, that can support up to four different players, to choose from: Stroke Play,
            Match Play and Balloon Pop, where the objective is to hit the ball accurately enough to hit a floating
            balloon on the course.

            Players can also customize their golfers with unlockable costumes and equipment, either by completing
            certain tasks in the game mode or using the game's monetary "Pang Points" that can be used to buy these
            items. They can also purchase different stats to help increase their players performance, hire caddies to
            help them out during matches and obtain special shots.</story>

        <story>FlingSmash is comparable to Wii Play, in that it is a title published by Nintendo to show off a bundled
            controller. Where Wii Play included the standard Wii Remote, FlingSmash is intended to show off the revamped
            Wii Remote Plus. This is essentially the Wii Remote featuring the Wii Motion Plus technology.

            The game itself is a combination of pinball and table tennis; the player uses the controller to fling the
            ball-shaped character - Zip - into horizontally or vertically scrolling screens of blocks and items in order
            to smash them. Zip changes size and form in various situations, including a heavy steel ball.

            The story revolves around this character, who needs to defend Sutton Island from an invader known as
            Omminus. There are eight regular stages to move through, each hiding five medallions for the player to find.
            Environments include the tops of tropical trees, grottoes under the sea, and beaches. Besides these regular
            stages, there are also eight extra stages and eight bonus mini-games.</story>

        <story>Thor on Wii gets a lot of things right. The core combat mechanic works well, even if many of your move
            options don t seem necessary. It s easy to get big chain attacks going, resulting in some flashy moves and a
            feeling that you truly are kicking some ass. Despite that, Thor is a mixed affair. Level design is
            unimaginably dull, and boss encounters are too far apart to be rewarding. Visually the game struggles, as
            well, with a streamlined graphical approach failing to hold off a staggeringly inconsistent framerate and
            other awkward glitches. That s really a shame.</story>

            Veterinarian! The player can handle over 30 different cases of animal patients that correspond to reality in
            a veterinary practice and have been developed by specialists in the field. A variety of different animal
            species needs medical attention, and the player must use all the techniques of a good veterinarian such as
            talking to the owners, analysis and diagnosis, treatment, surgery, control to heal the little darlings.
            Realistic diagnosis and treatment instruments are used, and as the experience grows, the player can even
            earn diplomas and distinctions in addition to the great satisfaction of his patients. The game offers three
            different levels of difficulty, plus a knowledge quiz with 150 questions. The game is using the Wii s own
            controller Wiimote and Nunchuck
            And allows a realistic immersion in the veterinarian world: the player can actively handle or operate
            animals, even in multiplayer, where two players can perform a complex treatment together.</story>

        <story>This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts' Tiger Woods PGA Tour
            franchise. Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen,
            it has a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and
            improved GameFace character creation.

            Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new
            Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to
            generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share
            is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an
            enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new
            animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay.
            The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows
            players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.

            PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of
            golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers
            (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.

        <story>The 2008 edition in the Tiger Woods PGA series introduces enhancements and improvements to the previous
            version without major graphical or gameplay changes. There are new courses (Xbox 360/PS3: 5 new, 16 in total
            - PS2: 6 new, 18 in total) and different licensed professional golf players to choose from (21 on the Xbox
            360/PS3 - 23 on the PS2/Wii).

            The Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and Windows versions allow players to import photos to create in-game faces on the
            characters based on custom images, using the Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation EyeToy, PlayStation Eye or
            a webcam. Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be
            improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing
            well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock
            additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.

            The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at
            Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing
            the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as
            power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but
            with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping
            track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great
            performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific
            courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.

            The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom
            challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).

            On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off.
            It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in
            3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using
            the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots.
            Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.</story>

            his mistakes and his immortality by waiting for the portal to come again, and send all the monsters back to
            whence they came. He also made his generals come to life, but they remained in stone form. The Stone
            Generals wanted to live forever, so they turned on Yaotl. The turtles, however, managed to defeat the
            Generals, the portal opened, and the monsters returned to their dimension. Yaotl then thanks the turtles and
            dies happy and free from guilt. After the story, the turtles all realize the importance of family and grow

        <story>Tony Hawk s Proving Ground is a video game developed by Vicarious Visions for the Nintendo DS, by
            Neversoft for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and by Page 44 Studios for the PlayStation 2 and Wii. Proving
            Ground is the ninth installment in the Tony Hawk s series, and the last to be developed by Neversoft as the
            franchise was then transferred to Robomodo.

            Proving Ground was not as successful as Project 8 (2006). When it debuted in 2007, critics were hesitant
            about its controls, despite receiving praise for its visuals and audio. Amidst this somewhat lackluster
            reception, it was a financial success. The Xbox 360 version in America came with a demo of Guitar Hero III:
            Legends of Rock, which was released on October 28, 2007.

            Proving Ground was the last game in the main series of Tony Hawk games for 8 years until Tony Hawk s Pro
            Skater 5 in 2015.</story>

        <story>This sequel to Battalion Wars plays much like its predecessor, blending real-time strategy with
            third-person shooting. The game's plot traces decades of war among six factions (Solar Empire, Western
            Frontier, Anglo Isles, Iron Legion, Tundran Territories, Xylvania), and unfolds through contemporary
            missions that advance the conflict and flashback missions that reveal its history.

            Players control a soldier or a land, sea, or air vehicle to engage in combat directly and to command other
            units. The Wii Remote is used to target and fire, but selecting and ordering units is performed through
            conventional button presses. The Wii Nunchuk's thumbstick controls player movement, and evasive maneuvers
            are handled through gestures.

            In the single-player campaign mode, the player assumes control of the various factions at different points
            in the conflict's history. The game also features three online multiplayer modes. Skirmish mode is a timed
            two-player match to score more points than the other player by destroying opposing units. Assault mode is a
            timed two-player match in which one player attempts to destroy the other player's resources and
            fortifications while the other defends. Co-Op mode is an untimed two-player match in which both players work
            together to complete special online missions that are not part of the single-player campaign. Offline local
            multiplayer is not supported.</story>

            This Wii version of the long-running PC racing series includes six background environments (stadium, coast,
            island, desert, snow and rally), each with a different car model (respectively the racing car, coupe, sports
            car, normal car, pickup and mini car).

            There are three modes: race mode, stunt mode and puzzle mode. In Race mode you simply have to finish a track
            in the fastest possible time. Each track has a predefined track record set by the programmers. There s a
            bronze, silver and gold medal time, which the player has to beat to earn those medals. In Stunt mode the
            tracks have a more acrobatic nature, and you have to finish them with as few restarts as possible. In Puzzle

        <story>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after
            the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat
            from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began
            popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the
            balance of power.

            The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters
            from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes
            that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on
            the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes:
            Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron.

            Though the game doesn t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as
            special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and
            fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that
            give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to
            fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.

            For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a "Remote Weapon
            System", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both
            players.</story>

        <story>Based on the 2007 movie, Transformers: The Game puts players in the role of either the Autobot or
            Decepticon factions in an attempt to find the AllSpark, the artifact which gave life to their race. The
            Autobots intend to protect it for good, while the Decepticons desire its power for evil. The two factions
            fought their battle on the planet Cybertron, but in an ultimate attempt to protect it, the Autobots hurled
            the AllSpark into space where it remained hidden on Earth. When the Decepticons discover the location, they
            want to finish the war on Earth.

            Set in a 3D sandbox environment with possibilities to interact and destroy the environment, players can
            choose between the two teams, each with different story-based goals. These are set on different locations,
            with primary and secondary quests. The storyline for the heroic Autobots follows the plot and events of the
            original movie. The storyline for the villainous Decepticons, however, allows the robots to destroy both the
            planet and more aggressively bring an end to their foes. Players can choose characters such as Optimus Prime
            or Bumblebee from the list of selectable Autobots, or Megatron and Starscream from the Decepticons.

            Shown from a third-person perspective, the robots can switch between a robot and a vehicle/aircraft form,
            jump, block, dive underground, roll, dodge, use various weapons, and climb buildings. Special actions can be
            unlocked through the skill tracker. By performing long slides or jumps, symbols in the tracker will light up
            and provide extras.

            Along the way, various collectibles can be found, ranging from promo images and artwork, to playable
            versions of the original "Generation 1" characters. The general gameplay is identical across the different
            platforms, but certain features are tied to specific versions.</story>

        <story>The fifth game in the Trauma series, Trauma Team expands the series' standard surgery gameplay to include
            five other medical fields. The stylized Trauma interface and Wii controls are adapted to new gameplay styles
            for these fields, while the series' traditional time limits have been removed to appeal to a broader
            audience. The player controls a unique character for each of the six modes, with each discovering a portion
            of an overarching storyline revealed as the game progresses.

            1. Surgery returns from the previous games with few changes. Players must use quick reflexes and repeating
            procedures to perform various operations. The Wii Remote is used to direct the application of various
            surgical tools, from applying healing gel to "pinching" with forceps to remove foreign objects. In 2-player
            co-op, tools are divided between the players, giving each player a distinct "role" in the surgery.

            First Response is similar to surgery, but with a quick pace focused on stabilizing patients instead of
            treating them. Players may have multiple patients at one time, with indicators at the top of the screen
            showing a rough estimate of each patient's vitals. The player can switch between treating patients as each
            one's condition worsens. The death of a patient in this mode is not a game over, and a limited amount of
            losses is considered acceptable.

            Diagnosis requires players to interview and examine patients in an office setting. The player may ask
            questions and order tests in order to identify symptoms. Symptoms are matched up with illnesses through a
            computer interface, with a meter increasing as the likely cause is narrowed down. The ultimate goal is a
            correct identification of the patient's ailment.

            Orthopedics has the player performing skeletal surgeries such as reinforcing bones and replacing artificial
            joints. Each surgery is done in very specific steps, with the correct tool automatically selected at each
            stage. The Wii Remote is used to set bones, screw in metal plates, or hammer in pins. The vitals meter is
            removed in this mode, and players are allowed a limited number of errors (swinging the remote too hard,
            missing a screw, etc) before failing the surgery. Performance is ranked by a running "chain" meter that adds
            multipliers for performing actions without mistakes.

            Endoscopy has the player inserting and guiding a camera tube into the patient in a first-person view from
            the camera. Players feed the tube into the patient by pushing the Wii Remote forward, and must steer to
            avoid hitting the walls of the veins or cavities the tube is traveling through. After locating the goal of
            the surgery (tumors, lesions, etc), the player must select tools and accurately apply them as in the surgery
            game. In two-player mode, players switch between controlling the endoscope and aiming its light.

            Forensics introduces various crime scenes the player must investigate. This mode plays similar to a
            traditional point-and-click adventure, with the player using the Wii Remote's pointer to locate and examine
            clues around the area. Players can also examine victims and perform autopsies. Clues or important points
            take the form of cards, which may be sent off for analysis, or combined with other cards. The player then
            uses these cards (or multiple choice answers) to answer questions regarding the specifics of the crime to

            either Isa or Kachi, the player traverses through on-rail levels, moving and shooting independently.
            Attacking enemies can either be shot at from afar, or melee attacked when they are close enough. Some
            missiles can be melee attacked to turn them against enemies. Getting successive enemy hits whilst remaining

            a meteor shower, gained control of the creatures and waged an unrelenting war upon civilization. Order and
            life were brought to the brink of destruction, but an alliance of the four races was able to drive them back
            and seal the evil. Centuries more have passed and once again the lands are slowly being overrun by the
            reemerging monsters. Without a known cause or even a united front to repel them, it would seem that this
            time, Eldar will fall. It is up to the main character to take up the forgotten mantle of the hero, reunite
            the races, and confront the hordes of monsters.</story>

        <story>Vertigo is a mix of the concepts of Marble Madness and the Monkey Ball series, but set in a futuristic
            environment. Players need to guide a shiny ball dubbed a xorb through high-tech environments at a high
            speed. The tracks are narrow and it is easy to drop off at any time, so precise steering is needed.

            Games can be played in an arcade mode with forking paths or in a career mode where new tracks are unlocked
            gradually. Courses are time-limited and set in very different environments. Checkpoint allow the player to
            respawn at certain sections. While playing, power-ups can be collected to access air brakes and other
            bonuses. The xorbs can be completely customized in terms of colour. Other game modes are time trial, three
            multiplayer modes and a bowling mini-game. In certain game modes the xorbs can be armed with weapons such as
            rockets and missiles, which also deform the xorb when taking damage.</story>

            factors. Each courses has a different look and feel to it, each with their own set of challenging obstacles.

            There is a career mode, where players can not only play as characters designed for the game, but also play
            classic Capcom characters such as Chun-Li and Jill Valentine. There is also a 4-player party mode and a
            "World Party" mode, where players can go online with the Mii's and challenge other players and winning

            more than 40 activities and exercises, including strength training, aerobics, yoga and balance games.
            Whether you're doing a yoga pose or snowboarding down a slalom course, there's an activity for everyone. *
            Challenge your family and friends to get in shape! Create your own personal profile and set goals, test your
            balance, track your progress with daily workouts and unlock new exercises and activities. Create a Profile:
            Before you jump into doing exercises and activities, you'll start by creating your own profile. Choose a
            Mii, enter your height and age information, and do a few quick tests: BMI Check: BMI, or Body Mass Index, is
            a measure of body fat based on height and weight that is the standard used by agencies such as the World
            Health Organization and the National Institute of Health. To check your BMI, you'll enter your height then
            stand on the Wii Balance Board and let it read your weight. Wii Fit Age: After you've checked your BMI,
            you'll do a basic balance test and find out your current Wii Fit Age. This basic balance test measures how
            well you can control your left and right balance. Based on the results, you'll be assigned a Wii Fit Age.
            Categories: Wii Fit features four main categories to choose from: Strength Training, Aerobics, Yoga and
            Balance Games. As you spend time exercising, you'll earn Fit Credits that unlock additional exercises and
            activities within these categories. Wii Fit also tracks the activities you do the most and puts them into
            the Favorites category. Strength Training: Put your strength to the test with muscle-toning exercises like
            Single Leg Extension, Sideways Leg Lift, Arm and Leg Lift, Single-Arm Stand, Torso Twists, Rowing Squat,
            Single Leg Twist, Lunge, Push-Up and Side Plank, Jackknife, Plank and Tricep Extension. Challenges include
            Push-Up Challenge, Plank Challenge and Jackknife Challenge. Aerobics: Get your heart pumping with fun,
            interactive Aerobic exercises like Hula Hoop®, Basic Step, Basic Run, Super Hula Hoop, Advanced Step, 2-P
            Run, Rhythm Boxing, Free Step and Free Run. Yoga: Work on your balance and flexibility with Yoga poses and
            activities like Deep Breathing, Half-Moon, Dance, Cobra, Bridge, Spinal Twist, Shoulder Stand, Warrior,
            Tree, Sun Salutation, Standing Knee, Palm Tree, Chair, Triangle and Downward-Facing Dog. Balance Games: Get
            into the action with fun, balanced-based games like Soccer Heading, Ski Slalom, Ski Jump, Table Tilt,
            Tightrope Walk, Balance Bubble, Penguin Slide, Snowboard Slalom and Lotus Focus. Tracking Results: Keep tabs
            on your daily progress with easy-to-understand graphs and charts. Using your personal profile, you can set
            goals, view a graph of your BMI results over time, see how many Fit Credits you've earned, check your Wii
            Fit Age and even enter exercise time you've done outside of Wii Fit. It's all about coming back and
            exercising a little every day, and the personal profile makes tracking your daily progress simple and easy.
            You can quickly check your Wii Fit Age and BMI without even putting the game in the console by going
            directly to the Wii Fit Channel. Up to eight family members can create their own profiles in Wii Fit. On the
            profile-selection screen, everyone in the family can see each other's recent BMI progress and Fit Credit
            total. This will allow families to have a friendly competition to exercise and get fit.</story>

        <story>Beyond the Jam Wii Music includes many other modes besides the main band jams, including several musical
            games and an enhanced video playback mode for recorded jams. ? Play it again: Use the playback mode to see
            your jam recordings brought to life with dramatic camera angles. ? Pick up the baton: Command an orchestra
            in the conducting game where you?ll wave the Wii Remote controller like a conductor?s baton to lead a Mii
            orchestra through orchestrated music. Make them play quickly, slowly, strongly or gently. ? Ring a bell?
            Play a handbells game where you?ll swing your Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers to play your two handbells
            as part of a larger ensemble. Everyone on the team has a job to do: Play one of your notes only when the
            tune demands it. ? An ear for music: Take a tone quiz that tests your musical ear by giving you challenges,
            like putting note-playing Miis in order from lowest to highest pitch. ? Bang the drum: Play a virtual drum
            set in the drumming mode, the one mode in Wii Music that also uses the Wii Balance Board accessory (sold
            with Wii Fit?). You?ll use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers as drumsticks, and place both feet on the
            Wii Balance Board?which work as virtual pedals for the bass drum and hi-hat cymbal. Create a musical
            masterpiece with up to four players. Anyone can play the huge selection of instruments in Wii Music with
            simple motions?like strumming and drumming. ? It?s easy to play improv jams. Musicians in your band jam by
            simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart?s content. Play
            faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more. No matter what you do, Wii Music automatically
            transforms your improv stylings into great music. There are no mistakes?just playing for the pure joy of
            playing. ? Wii controls immerse you in the music. You can play most of the 60-plus instruments in Wii Music
            using simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Strum to play guitar, banjo and sitar.
            Drum to play jazz drums, congas and marching drums. Hammer away to play piano, vibraphone and marimba.
            Unlike most music games, Wii Music doesn?t make you use complex buttons. You only need to imitate playing
            the instrument. ? Wii Music offers virtually endless ways to make music. You choose the song and instruments
            and decide whether to blaze through a rock take on classical songs, put a jazzy spin on folk tunes or
            transform Nintendo classics like the Super Mario Bros.® theme into Latin-flavored numbers. The song list is
            only a takeoff point?it?s how you improvise with the songs that matters. ? Send your band-jam recordings to
            Wii Friends who have Wii Music. They?ll see your Mii? band members, your players? improv styles and your
            instrument selections. They can watch your recordings, or play over parts of your song, then send their
            modified recording back to you. Improv jams can be sent back and forth over WiiConnect24 and changed again
            and again.</story>

        <story>PES 2009 for Wii boasts three control methods, with the intuitive 'point and drag' interface of last
            year's game enhanced to make defending and shooting more instinctive. Players use the Nunchuck or the Wii
            Remote to control the player on the ball, while they pick the player to pass to, or send them on runs into
            space. The system has been further refined, so that close control is improved, but two new control ideas
            have also been implemented.Users can now play PES 2009 using either the Classic Controller or the Wii Remote
            held sideways. Selecting these offers a take on the classic PES controls from other versions, with the many
            through balls, chips and shots allocated individual buttons on both controllers. Mixtures of these systems
            can also be allowed during co-op multi-player games, with users opting to use their favored system from the
            user-friendly menu system.Other key advances include the addition of the UEFA Champions League, the greatest
            club competition in European football, as a stand-alone option with all-new introductory elements, and a
            greatly expanded Champions Road mode. Champions Road is an incentive-based game, wherein players are
            rewarded for success in competitions.Players are given individual challenges, each of which is allocated a
            cash bonus. These range from scoring a hat-trick, to string multiple passes together, etc, and the monies
            raised can be invested in improving the facilities at the user's chosen club. Everything from oxygen
            capsules through to private jets can be bought, all of which will help entice better players to the club,
            while the players involved improve their experience stats during matches.PES 2009 for Wii also marks the
            introduction of the Master League, which has proven so popular in PES for other home gaming formats. Master
            League places the player in charge of a lowly team and charges them with building their reputation and
            success through astute signings, good on-field performances and training methods. Every aspect of overseeing

        <story>PES 2010 for the Nintendo format will share the cover stars in Lionel Messi and Fernando Torres. And will
            also boast the extensive additions to the Master League via the integration of UEFA Champions League license
            elements, while the Wii game's graphic elements have been further enhanced. However, Producer Akiyoshi
            'Greyhound' Chosogabe and his dedicated team have also worked to add key gameplay advances to the new
            iteration.Likewise, a decisive addition to PES 2010 is an all-new game balance system that affects both
            attacking and defensive elements of the game. The player in possession now has 'instantaneous stamina' in
            addition to his overall stamina, which prevents unbeatable runs from being used as a constant tactic.
            Overuse of sprinting will have an adverse affect on the player's body balance and their immediate control of
            the ball. As in a real match, excessive attempts of trying to gain possession will drain the player's
            stamina, further demonstrating the Wii game's realism.Proper and timely controls within the context of match
            have also be given more importance. More fine and strategic controls have been given more significance, and
            an attacking player with the ball can perform various 'AI feints' to bypass the opposition defenders while
            dribbling - but is in accordance with the player's abilities. Defenders will also have to think of which
            areas to close down from, and work with other players to reduce the space attackers have.Greyhound has also
            worked hard on a new free kick system, wherein these set pieces are now viewed from the kicker's perspective
            and targeted using a pointer system, allowing users to add swerve and additional pace to their kicks,
            dependent on the taker's abilities. This level of control even allows players to move their keeper earlier
            in a match against human player.New animations will see players signaling for passes, and the slickest
            animation in a PES title on Wii yet, while the Champions Road and Master League modes mark a welcome return
            again. "The stakes have been raised and PES 2010 for Wii shows that Konami can still innovate and surprise,"
            commented Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe. "Our control system for Wii is still regarded as the finest and
            most intuitive around, and we have once again reworked it to add a level of control and realism that can
            appeal to new and old PES fans alike."</story>

        <story>Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 (officially abbreviated as PES 2012 and known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven
            2012 in Asia) is a video game which is the eleventh edition in the Pro Evolution Soccer series developed and
            published by Konami (and MicroByte in Argentina) with production assistance from the Blue Sky Team. Lionel
            Messi, who was the cover star for the series since PES 2009, was replaced by PES 2008 cover star Cristiano
            Ronaldo, while Shinji Kagawa replaces Messi as the cover star for the Japanese version. The US and Latin
            American cover features Santos player Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo. Like previous versions of the game, it
            will be exclusively licensed by UEFA to contain the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Super
            Cup competitions along with a license from CONMEBOL to feature the Copa Santander Libertadores. Referees'
            governing UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Super Cup matches will wear the official UEFA
            Champions League uniforms, which is a first for the series. Primeira Liga were included for the first time
            in series with three licensed teams. On July 28, 2011, Konami confirmed that PES 2012 was going to be
            released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows on October 14, 2011 in Europe and October 6, 2011
            in Japan. At Gamescom 2011 it was announced that the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2 versions would
            follow on October 28, 2011 and the Wii on November 4, 2011. The publisher has also confirmed that versions
            for Nintendo 3DS and iOS formats are also in development, with firm dates to follow. There are two demos,
            both of which were released for the PlayStation 3, PC although the Xbox 360 only had the second demo due to
            problems with the first one. The first is based on a preview build of the game and was released on August
            24, 2011 for PlayStation 3 and PC, though because of "issues on both sides" according to Jon Murphy, PES
            Team Leader, it was not released on the Xbox 360. The second demo was released 14 September on the Xbox 360,
            PlayStation 3 and PC.</story>

        <story>WWE 13 will run on the engine called, "Predator Technology 2.0," which succeeds the first version from
            WWE 12. The Predator Technology 2.0 game engine has been updated from the previous WWE games to allow for
            more fluid animations, with odd collisions and transitions having been fixed and updated, it also allows for
            over 300 new moves. Past problems have been fixed with a better weight detection system, contextual
            animations and automatic attack homing, to ensure that the character always strikes towards the enemy. The
            contextual animation system has been refined to ensure that it dynamically swaps out moves to make sure that
            the game is using the appropriate move animations at any given time and state. The weight detection system
            makes it so that small superstars such as Rey Mysterio are unable to lift larger wrestlers such as the Big
            Show. Thus, the contextual animations ensure that more appropriate attacks are put in the superstar s normal
            moveset. The game s new homing system is designed that when doing high flying moves, a player will hit the
            intended target with better precision. The homing system also tracks tables so that they will be better
            detected when doing grapples on a ladder in TLC and Ladder matches.[4]

            The game is the first to feature Spectacular Moments, also known as "OMG! Moments." This feature allows
            players to bug the game to make it seem as ring breaks, barricade breaks, announce table breaks, and
            catching (mid-air) finishers are possible.[5] The Predator Technology engine has been further updated to
            include an enhanced audio engine, dubbed WWE Live. Instead of chanting pre-recorded in a warehouse as done
            in previous WWE games, WWE Live features chanting recorded from live WWE events. To make the audio more
            authentic, WWE Live features more crowd participation, with the crowd s chants, cheering and booing being
            dependent on the situation occurring in the match. Sounds were recorded by the WWE Production team and THQ
            from actual live events. Divas matches have also been updated, with up to six Divas, created and original,
            being able to compete simultaneously in the ring, a feature absent for many years. WWE 13 will also feature
            WWE Universe 3.0, which was also further updated to allow the player to edit schedules, television shows,
            rosters, as well as creating alliances or feuds between several wrestlers.

            On September 21, it was confirmed that WWE 13 would contain the I Quit Match for the first time since WWF
            SmackDown! and the King of The Ring Tournament.[6]</story>

            tag team action, including all new Hot-Tag, tag team finishers and new actions to help in the match.

            As with the previous game the roster includes over 60 superstars from Smackdown, Raw and ECW. To keep the
            roster up-to-date, the game includes a roster editor allowing players to change the rosters superstars are
            on and change their alignment between face and heel. However, this is the first game in the Smackdown series
            since "Here Comes the Pain" not to feature any legends.

            Another new feature is Create-a-Finisher, which allows players to create their own unique finishing move out
            of over 500 different animations. These can also be shared online during online matches.

            This game includes two different story modes, i.e. Road to Wrestlemania and Career mode. Road to
            Wrestlemania mode allows you to play 6 unique stories involving Triple H, CM Punk, Chris Jericho, The
            Undertaker, John Cena and a co-op storyline featuring Batista and Rey Mysterio. Career mode is the
            replacement of GM Mode from previous games. This allows you to make a career for superstars and upgrade your
            created wrestlers.

            Other features include the Highlight Reel, letting you create videos from your matches, the brand new

        <story>WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 is a professional wrestling video game that is based on the two brands of WWE,
            Raw and SmackDown.

            One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be
            used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break
            differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested
            onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw
            game, chairs can be thrown at your opponents.</story>

            Zack &amp; Wiki: Quest for Barbaros Treasure is presented as a series of stages where the player directs

            will have the desired effect without triggering traps or attracting the attention of the enemies. Using most

        <story>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword once again places the player in control of Link, a Hylian boy who this
            time around lives in the floating nation of Skyloft. Link is in love with a local girl called Zelda but one
            day while flying on their bird mounts, a tornado shows up out of nothing and takes Zelda away from Link.
            After that Link teams up with Fi, a spirit living within a sword and he descends to the long-forgotten
            surface to search for Zelda.

            The game is structured very similar to previous Zelda games: you travel through an overworld in search of
            temples to visit and once in you solve a series of puzzles before fighting a boss at the end and receive the
            next bit of plot. The biggest change is that the overworld is more focused on puzzles this time around with
            only a handful of action. Also new is the implementation of the Wii Motion Plus which allows full 1:1
            controls and new puzzle possibilities.</story>

        <story>Twilight Princess is the first Legend of Zelda game for the Wii and also the last for GameCube. At first
            Link is a simple farm boy, whose tasks consist of herding goats to watching children in Ordon village,
            Link's home town. One day, Link is asked by the mayor to run an errand in Castle Town, but things sudden go
            wrong?

            The land becomes dark, and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm, which
            turns most into ghosts. Link, however, becomes a wolf. After becoming a wolf, Link is aided by Midna, a
            resident of the Twilight Realm. Midna helps Link find a way to turn human again along with other tasks.

            The wolf cannot use a sword or other items. Instead, as a wolf Link must use his senses to solve puzzles and
            get past obstacles. The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. It can push
            blocks with its head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, it can attack enemies by
            biting or pouncing on them.

            As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects
            many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn't before. Link
            performs many attacks with his sword and can even learn other sword moves.

            The game's art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of
            The Wind Waker. Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles and quite a few
            locations from Ocarina of Time can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with
            dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.
