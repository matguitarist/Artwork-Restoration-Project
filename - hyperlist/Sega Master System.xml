		<story>20 em 1 (20 in 1) is a compilation of twenty previously unreleased games in a single cartridge, which
			came bundled with Tec Toy's Master System III Compact (Master System II in Europe and US). The games
			included are:
			The player is a construction worker trying to get falling tools with a bucket. He must get as many as he can
			until the time runs out.

			obstacles such as bombs. He must get as many as he can until the time runs out.
			3. A skateboarding side scrolling game: the player must run as far as you he while avoiding obstacles such
			as holes in the street, until the time runs out.
			4. The player is what seems to be a flea, running and jumping while the screen scrolls over a mountain of
			blocks, avoiding to get stuck behind the hills.
			5. The player is a mouse trying to catch the cheese pieces that fall from the shelves. In order to do so, he
			can jump (by pressing button 1), and he must get as many as he can until the time runs out.
			6. The player is a diver on a sunken ship, getting coins which fall from above, while avoiding being caught
			by a shark. He must get as many as he can until the time runs out.
			7. A motocross racing game: the player must run down the road while avoiding obstacles trying to reach the
			next checkpoint before the time runs out.
			8. An arcade racing game: the player must run down the street while avoiding getting hit by the other cars,
			until the time runs out.
			9. The player is a little Brazilian Indian sailing his boat on a river, while avoiding obstacles such as
			rocks and arrows. He must get as far as he can until the time runs out.
			10. A helicopter combat game. The player must shoot (by pressing button 1) the enemy helicopter as much as
			he can, avoiding to get hit, until the time runs out.
			11. The player is a frog trying to catch the insects that fall from the sky. He must get as many as he can
			until the time runs out, while jumping from one victoria amazonica to another. He must project his tong (by
			pressing the button 1) in order to get the insects.
			12. A classic space shooter. Fly your spaceship while the screen scrolls down, avoiding obstacles and
			shooting as many spaceships as he can, until the time runs out.

			while avoiding getting hit by other planes, until the time runs out.
			14. A roller skating side scrolling game: the player must run as far as you he while avoiding obstacles such
			as logs in the street, until the time runs out.
			15. A pong game with a twist: the player is a cooker trying to hit mini-pizzas inside an oven. The pizzas
			will bounce back if they don't get inside the oven. The player has 5 mini-pizzas and must try to hit as many
			as he can until the time runs out.
			16. The player is a insecticide can trying to kill the insects that fall from the roof. He must kill as many
			as he can until the time runs out by shooting insecticide (by pressing the button 1) at them.
			17. In this side scrolling game, the player is a boy who must run all the way right while shooting (by
			pressing button 1) other boys with his water gun, avoiding to get hit by them, before the time runs out. He
			must shoot as many boys as he can.
			18. A skiing game: the player must race down the mountain while avoiding obstacles trying to reach the next
			checkpoint before the time runs out.
			19. The player controls a police car running up the screen, while avoiding getting hit by other cars. He
			must get as far as he can, until the time runs out.
			20. Another pong game: this time the player is at a squash court. He must try to hit the ball as much as he
			can until the time runs out. He has 3 balls.

			In order to win, the player must score a certain amount of points in each game (which vary from game to
			game). If the player scores less the specified amount, he loses. In the "catch the object" and shooter games
			(1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17), points are earned by catching or shooting objects. In racing games
			(3, 7, 8, 9, 14, 18 and 19), points are earned by the distance ran. In game 15 points are earned by hitting
			the oven; in game 20, by number of hits in the ball. In these games (15 and 20), the player can loose if he
			misses all his balls/pizzas. In game 4 no points are earned at all, and you'll loose if the character gets
			stuck and the screen scrolls over him.

			The game has only two songs, one played at the title screen, the other played during all gameplay. All the
			text in the game is in Portuguese.</story>

		<story>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite
			vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The
			first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force
			field and the fourth invulnerablility.

			By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D
			allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the
			letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five
			missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

			There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the
			high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

			Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</story>

		<story>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat
			and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons
			(basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the
			time.

			The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart
			it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes
			you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</story>

			Gameplay takes several different forms: some levels are chases, where Aladdin runs automatically, but must
			be made to jump over chasms or rolling rocks and barrels, evade falling objects and avoid getting caught by
			a guard. Other levels are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, jump and climb, find keys or switches to
			open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be collected and be thrown to dispatch enemies or hit
			buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the

			Getting all the pieces is only the start, he must then fight his way through a forest filled with ninja

			with other nasties. The question is: will Alex make his way to the arcades before 17:00?

			Alex Kidd: High-Tech World allows you to resume a saved game. All you have to do is enter a password, and
			the game will be resumed right where you left off. The game is time-based, and events can only happen at
			certain times. For instance, certain characters will appear when thirty minutes of each hour is up.

			During the game, you can access a status screen, which helps you keep track of the time, what floor you're

			strangest places like golden eggs, the Fantazy Zone ship out of action, clamshells, Christmas presents,
			pumpkins, and desk bells.

			Alex must then venture in outer space to defeat the evil Ziggurat. Locations include Toy World, Machine
			World, the World of Make Believe, Water World, and Monster World. You will even tour through the giant's
			body. Once you obtained the six miracle balls, you have to run through all the locations again, but these
			repeated locations introduce new enemies.

			With all the locations, you're under a time limit, and as usual, if the time expires, you lose a life. Alex
			starts the game with nothing, but during the game, he can collect power-ups that give him extra time, and

		<story>The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their
			creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and
			special attacks.

			When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to
			complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all
			the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens.
			Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are
			capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission
			has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.

			When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by
			the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your
			ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These
			types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon
			summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his
			present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear.
			However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy,
			you can't use it.

			At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also,
			at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object
			is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building.

			You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.</story>

			boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

			The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by
			defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a
			tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities
			such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human
			form.

			The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</story>

		<story>A game endorsed by the American player who stunned the tennis world in the early 90s with his "Image is
			everything" looks, sporting long hair, earrings and colorful shirts, Andre Agassi Tennis includes eight
			players (male and female and as as expected, only Agassi is a real player) rated according to movement speed
			and both accuracy and strength on serve, backhand and forehand.

			Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and
			forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball
			outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.
			Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions add a fourth, Hard), but the differences
			between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a
			"Skins" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.

		<story>Ayrton Senna won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, as well as 3 Formula One world championships, so he was
			the perfect man to license a home sequel to the classic arcade racing game. As before, the action is viewed
			from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons.

			There are three main modes:

			1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps.

			2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that
			affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining
			modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There
			are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and
			get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top
			spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this
			mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars
			frequently.

			3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions.
			There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is
			a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps
			(between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).

			While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup
			options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against
			16 drivers. The car can be instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.</story>

			4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block

			then, upon defeating that opponent, moves on to play Frogs at the Pond, One Eyed Aliens at the Waterfall,
			Vampires in the Skeleton Cave, Geishas in the Bamboo Forest, before finally playing against Samurais at the
			Shrine. If the player loses a match then that match can be replayed until won.

			The player at the start of each match gets to pick how long the match duration is out of the options of 15,
			30, or 45 minutes (not in real time) before being placed on the court. When on the court the player always
			plays towards the right of the court. First the player tries to get the ball from a throw by a well timed
			button press. When the player has the ball the player has the option to move, pass the ball, and jump. When
			jumping the player can shoot, with the accuracy of the shot depending on the timing, or just simply pass.
			When defending the player can cycle through the field or just simply run into the opponent to challenge for
			the ball. There are a few penalties that the player can get including but not limited to Travelling (not
			passing after jumping), Charging (Sometimes called when the player with the ball runs into an opponent), and
			Pushing (Sometimes called when the player without the ball runs into an opponent) with all the penalties
			resulting with the other team getting the ball on the side of the court.

			Also there are two more modes called CPU vs CPU, where the player can get the CPU to play itself and Versus
			Play to play against a friend. In both modes the player or players pick one of the 8 nations that are USA,
			CBA, CHN, JPN, URS, DDR, CAN, and FRN all with a character representing a player of that nation. All the

			version, the Master System version has slightly different levels and gameplay mechanics.

			Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These include the streets and
			rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store, the sewers, and the Penguin's lair. For the first
			four levels, a route can be selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the game.

			Enemies standing in Batman's way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at them. At the beginning, the
			weapon's range is very limited, but it can be expanded by collecting powerups. Other tools Batman can use
			are a grappling hook to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his cape,
			which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls.

			Unlike in the Game Gear version, there is no health bar: a single hit will kill Batman. To compensate, the

			fighting Chinese Kung Fu men, wrestlers, jujitsu men, eagles, ninjas, and black women. When you get halfway
			through the chapter, you will fight a different enemy than one that you encounter before. At the end of each
			chapter, you have to defeat several bosses before continuing on to the next round. Each type of these has
			their own personal strengths and weaknesses.

			Once you touch an enemy or boss, you will lose energy. once you lose all energy, you lose a life, but more
			life can be restored by getting the cake when it comes across the screen in mid-air, or by defeating an
			enemy that will come at you halfway and you receive a bonus for doing so.

		<story>Blade Eagle 3-D is a vertical shoot-em-up which has no story involved. You just have to shoot your way on
			three planets (you have to travel through space first), blasting as many enemies as possible. Along the way,
			there are several bosses that you have to defeat. The later ones drop a power-up, which you can use to
			upgrade your ship. Some of the power-ups include double shots and laser beams. Another power-up gives you
			the ability to have an extra ship on your side and will join the fight, and will later serve as a backup.
			Blade Eagle is designed for play in conjunction with the Sega 3-D Glasses. If you play without the 3-D
			glasses, it will look like as if there are two of your ships, not just one. If there are four enemies

			his sword to kill cats, rats, bats, witches, skeletons, and other creatures that are waiting for him. When

			cyborg fortress to get rid of all the chief cyborgs in each of the seven areas.

			The game screen is divided into three sections. This includes a first-person view of the map, in which you
			can see objects that are coming your way. There are two types of objects: red objects indicate the lower
			cyborgs, while white ones indicate the chief cyborgs. Next to it is a map of the area, your life and psycho
			power count. Below these is the action screen.

			In each of these seven areas, there are several floors which can be reached via the elevator. At the
			beginning of the game, your only weapons are your fists, but weapons can be collected throughout each area,
			which include psycho punch, ray gun, light gun, and bombs. Power-ups like extra life and psycho power can
			also be collected. If you use the psycho punch or psycho gun, your psycho power gets depleted, and when it
			is empty, you must stock up on some more. You can also get shields that will protect you from laser beams,
			and jet engines so that you can fly over hazards.
			In some areas, you defeat a boss which leaves an ID card, which you can use to access other areas of the
			fortress.

			Some chief cyborgs are easy to kill, while some are hard. You will just have to work out which weapon works
			best with them. The game ends when you lose all your life.

			You are not alone in this mission. You also have Adina, your contact back at headquarters. Follow her
			instructions carefully and you may survive.

			Unfortunately, Gilba was successfully resurrected and another warrior, Danan, was called. His quest is to

			Light", and "The Knife of Light".

			a boss, which takes quite a number of hits to kill with your sword. Once they are defeated, they are likely
			to give you one of the objects that you need to defeat Gilbas. More to the story is then revealed.

			that are found in yellow chests. These animals are quite useful in dangerous situations. The eagle, for

		<story>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix".
			In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you
			want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and
			Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult.

			There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit
			in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a
			race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you
			can skip a track if you want.

			F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.

			Cloud Castle's tower.

			The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual
			scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the
			character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such
			as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone.

			Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple
			puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies
			avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle.
			Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower.</story>

		<story>Sega decided to make their last game in the Fantasy Zone series different. You see, the gameplay now
			involves you going around mazes, collecting all the dots while avoiding enemies. You are awarded points for
			each dot collected, but they vary depending on their size. For example, small dots award ten points each,
			while you get 200 points for each larger dot you collect. Once you have collected all the dots in the maze,
			the enemies will turn into coins, which you must quickly get in a strict time limit and you move on to the
			next maze. Just before this, though, you get a statistics screen that shows the amount of time that you
			spent in the maze. Points are also awarded, but sadly, if you spent over sixty seconds in a maze, you won't
			get any.

			Every world you travel to consist of three mazes, and after you complete all three, a bonus round appears
			where the object is to collect all coins before time expires. While you are collecting the dots in the
			normal mazes, you must touch the enemy's energy, a flashing red spot within each maze to avoid
			2nd-generation enemies from entering the mazes. Some power-ups can be collected, which consist of weapons
			and speed boosters (big wings), which can be collected by landing on the circle which it is in. However, you
			need money in form of the amount outlined just before each maze. If you land on a circle while you are short
			of cash, a 'NO SELLING' sign will appear above it, and you have to collect some more dots and try again.

			Also you can die by touching an enemy. When you die, a coin will take you place, and when you get
			resurrected, you can grab the coin. The game can be played with two players, but the same rule applies in a
			2-player game.</story>

			alley!
			Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The road
			surface is dire and covered with rocks!
			And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance.

			Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney.
			At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and the
			starting position of the player.
			Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game
			takes ten turns. while a match takes three games.

			Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site.
			On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared! Don't let Wilma find that out!
			Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some
			scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her.

			Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the

			to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here,
			the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game

			the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money,
			which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle.

		<story>Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved Princess
			Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in some versions) has
			become the new leader of Ghoul Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees the Princess' castle and
			her village under attack by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her beloved knight, the Princess is
			struck by one of Lucifer's laser beams.

			Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue the Princess'
			soul and bring her back to life! And it won't matter whether he fights in his shining armor or in his
			underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by some monsters! Although the
			game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, later levels are set in a
			tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.

			Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to hack down the
			aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery slopes.
			Different weapons can be collected, by finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five stages has its
			own setting and a final boss.</story>

			In ancient times a horde of giants rebelled against the elders and a brutal war ensued. Things looked grave
			until finally a hero, carrying the Golden Axe, appeared and drove back the giants. Since then, the kingdom
			of Firewood has been ruled by a family that had mastered the power of the nine crystals to ward off all evil
			from Firewood. Everyone lived in peace until one of Firewood's ministers betrayed his king and sold the nine
			crystals to Death Adder, one of the evil giants. Death Adder has hidden the nine crystals in nine dungeons,
			has unleashed hordes of monsters and is threatening to take over the world. Will there be another hero who
			can find the Golden Axe and defeat Death Adder?

			Gameplay in Golden Axe Warrior is very similar to The Legend Of Zelda, meaning you will spend most of your
			time exploring the large overworld fighting against lots of enemies and looking for the dungeons in which
			the crystals are hidden. Inside the dungeons you have to fight more enemies, find treasures and keys, solve
			simple puzzles and defeat the dungeon's boss to get one of the crystals. In order to survive against the
			large number of enemies, you will be able to find many different weapons and three different spells.</story>

		<story>Golfamania is a golfing simulation game where players play on an 18 hole golf course with all the rules
			and scoring like in the real game.

			Within the game there are 4 different modes to play on that includes Practice, Match Play, Stroke Play, and
			Pro Tournament. In Practice a single player can play any of the 18 holes available. Match Play is 2 player
			mode against human or computer. Stroke Play is the player can play up to 4 others that can include 1
			computer player. In this mode the character skill can increase in 3 different areas that are power,
			accuracy, and luck with the 6 different characters available. The main mode is the Pro Tournament and it is
			where the player plays against over 30 computer players (all playing different holes) with the objective to
			score lower than the other players (as per the rules of golf). Based on performance the player can earn
			experience points (XP) that they can use to upgrade the power, accuracy, and luck of the character for
			future tournaments. Some of the holes have awards like ‘longest drive’ and ‘hole in one’ awards that can
			earn bonus XP.

			Regardless of the mode the game is played in the same sort of way. The player selects a character (the
			selection depends on the mode) and then sets up the character by naming and picking their style. In all
			modes but Practice the player must pick 3 golf clubs that they must remove from their selection of 17
			different clubs (1-5 wood, 1-9 Iron, Pitching Wedge, Sand Wedge, and Putter). When playing the player is
			presented with a top down view where the player lines up the shot and the location on the golf ball they
			want to hit (for spin). Then the player selects the club they want to use (all go varying distances). When
			that is all done the player must play the skill part of the game, where they are presented with a power bar
			that has a marker that going is up and down along it. The player must stop the marker on the red area in the
			centre of the power bar to get a good hit (with the center been a perfect hit)and if this area is missed the
			ball will only travel about 20 yards (compared to about 100+ yards of a good hit). The amount of red that is
			on the power bar depends on the golf club used. To help the player the distance of the shot can be lowered
			in exchange for a lower marker speed and can be used for shots closer to the hole (very helpful for putter
			shots). The game uses battery backed RAM save to continue play later.</story>

		<story>GP Rider is an arcade like motorcycle racing game that players can race in all the tracks of all the 15
			tracks of the 1989 Motorcycle Grand Prix. There is also an extra Arcade track for the player to race on.

			There are 3 modes of play that are Arcade, Tournament, and Grand Prix. In Arcade the player races on only 1
			track that is named Arcade. In Tournament players get to choose any number of tracks to race, from 0 (which
			defaults to the Arcade track) to all 15 available tracks. Grand Prix is where the player races in all 15
			tracks in order of the 1989 season.

			All races regardless of the mode played in the same way. The game is played on a split screen even if only
			one player is playing. A CPU character named Wayne controls the bike on the top screen if there is no other
			player playing. Wayne races like a real player would, having both good and bad races and occasionally making
			mistakes. The race is made up of a Qualify to determine gird position and then the Race where the player
			races 15 other races (including Wayne) over a predefined number of laps depending on track length. The track
			can raced in ether the wet or the dry (only dry in Arcade mode) and the weather can change from the Qualify
			to the Race. The races take place on flat roads with straights and curves simulating the layout of the real
			track. On the bike there is a fuel gage that simply counts down the seconds left of fuel and is
			automatically refilled at the completion of each lap. If the player doesn’t complete the lap before time
			runs out then the player will “Out of Fuel” and end the race in the placed down with other non-finishers. At
			the end of each race (accept in Arcade mode) the player will get points depending on there position before
			going onto the next race.

			The player sets up the bike with some basic set ups that are all available from the start. In Arcade mode
			the player has the options of an Automatic or Manual gearbox with either High Gearing (better top speed) or
			Low Gearing (better acceleration). In Tournament and Grand Prix modes the options are extended to Engine
			type of Lean, Medium, and Thirsty which progressively adds speed while cutting the time available per lap.
			There is gearing that works the same as Arcade mode, and a tyre type of wet and dry depending on the

			jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the

			(1989-90).

			In Joe Montana Football the player can play a game of American Football with Joe Montana giving the player
			basic tips on the next best move. The player can play against a friend or play the computer with 3
			difficulty levels (beginner, normal, and professional) in a full game (5 min per quarter) using all the real

			mentioned. Once the coin is flipped and the kick-off the game begins.

			The player controls the on-screen player as they try to run up the field. Once the player is downed the game
			turns to a play selection screen where the player can choose their next play (tactic) out of the 17
			different preset plays available, as well as a punt, attempt at a field goal, or a turnover, all done in
			full view of the opponent (the CPU will change their play to match yours). More often then not Joe himself
			will give a tip on the best play that it will default to. On the field the player controlling the
			quarterback can throw it to the receiver (changing the player control to the receiver), change the receiver
			to pass to, or try to run with the quarterback. When play changes hands and the player becomes a defender
			the player has 6 defensive plays to choose from as well as a turnover. On the field the player controls a
			single player chosen by cycling though the players or selecting the player closest to the selected receiver.
			Two player mode works the same as single player but with a player instead of the computer.</story>

		<story>One of many games based on the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, the version for Sega's 8-bit systems
			combines side-scrolling shooting action and platforming levels.

			In each of the five stages of the game, one escaped dinosaur species must be recaptured. Each level begins
			with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with
			a crosshair. If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful dinosaur
			follows.

			After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player must
			jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards
			like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the way, but
			can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the
			often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.

			The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled
			in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have
			been completed.</story>

		<story>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it
			would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of
			Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind
			those earthquakes.

			Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play
			with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help
			them in several tasks.

			Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean
			the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must
			clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

			After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For
			instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among
			the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

			Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and
			character.</story>

		<story>If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro
			Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across
			a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit,
			Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

			These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open
			to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table.
			Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The
			desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the
			open homework.

			Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you
			race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount
			of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every
			third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in
			a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.

			The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one
			car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it
			reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if
			3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play
			off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to
			Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.</story>

		<story>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years,
			was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung. Shang was accompanied by Prince
			Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in
			a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness,
			Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme
			as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near,
			Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor,
			Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special
			Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin
			Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

			Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each
			player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the
			opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the
			loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked
			finale.

			Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to
			represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</story>

			Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo"

			her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that

			the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the

			Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles

			In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in
			the top half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.
			Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the
			hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then
			pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event
			where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on

			through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!

			The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno
			through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and
			finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his
			trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like
			out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies
			are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can -
			depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly,
			boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more.

			Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to

			unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by

		<story>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the

			maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn
			blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The
			maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of
			tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned
			this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</story>

			of the later bosses are exactly the same as the earlier ones. The title is a bit misleading because you can
			also play as three other characters including Hippo, Leopard, and Monkey Boy. Each character has their own
			disadvantages. For example, Hippo is much slower than the other three. However, all the characters share one
			thing in common: they can use their fists and punch enemies as they approach them. They can also jump on
			them and keep knocking them in the ground until they disappear off the face of the earth. If they don't make
			them disappear, they will pop back out again and set out for revenge. Obstacles are scattered through each
			area, including spikes, cannonballs, esculators, fireballs, and steam.

			You start the game with three lives. Once you touch an enemy, you lose a life. Lose any of your lives, and
			the game is over. If the game is over, you can continue where you left off. There are several items to find,
			and these can help you on your quest, and one of these items are eggs. If you break any of these eggs,
			either the "switch" item or the invincibility item is revealed. If you're lucky enough, a white bag is also
			revealed, but more often than not, one of your enemies can pop out from inside the egg. One egg will reveal
			a bird which you can carry for the rest of the game. This bird may be nothing but a pest, as it hinders your
			progress, but you can throw it at enemies to knock them out. It can also be used as a backup, meaning that
			you can have enemies touching you, but it is the bird that is killed, not you.

			There is little chance that you'll find a white bag inside an egg, unless you go up into a secret area,
			which can often be found if you jump on springs that are scattered throughout the level. These white bags
			are useless, until you get to the bonus areas, which are at the end of each area. In these bonus stages, you
			can place a number of foxes on a path depending on how much white bags you've collected throughout each
			area.

			When you complete Psycho Fox, you are treated to a funny ending.</story>

		<story>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay. You
			control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

			The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without
			firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of
			energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in
			your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called
			"The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any
			enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an
			offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type,
			since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in
			order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main
			gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser
			beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one
			follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

			The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien
			movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi
			mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the
			fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with
			intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes,
			without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</story>

			to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by
			playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other
			racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular
			road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

			By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better
			bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose
			valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is
			possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

			Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle
			simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</story>

			the others). Ratopulga can jump higher than any other character, while Tartafede is the fastest one. Sapo
			Xulé is the most balanced of them.

			In this side-scrolling/platform game, all characters can kill their enemies by punching or jumping on top of
			them, until they are completely buried. If they are not buried completely, the enemies will pop out of the
			ground and come after the character again. Besides the monsters, other common obstacles are spikes,

			The characters can also find Sapo Xulé's stinky shoes, which can be used as a boomerang-like weapon. If they
			are hit when carrying the shoe, they'll just lose it instead of dying.

			To switch among the characters, the player must find green potions, usually hidden inside eggs, or carried
			by enemies. Other special items can be collected, such as "invincibility flies", Sapo Xulé's stinky socks
			(which kill every enemy on the screen) and some white bags, which are meant to be used at the bonus stages.

			The bonus stages consist of labyrinths with several paths, each leading to prizes or nothing at all. Each
			white bag collected at the main stages give the player an extra character to set up for a different path at
			the labyrinth, raising the chances of reaching a prize in the end.

			Apart from changes in the main characters, some enemy sprites were replaced, such as the first boss - which

		<story>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from
			the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

			On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are
			planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough
			"proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members
			will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since
			the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants,
			Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

			The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the
			first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even
			involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

			Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting
			devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.</story>

		<story>Tia Nastácia (Aunt Anastacia) is sick, and Dr. Caramujo (Dr. Snails) is called to examine her. And he's
			got some good and bad news. Good news is that she can be cured. Bad news is that, to prepare the medicine,
			he'll need five rare ingredients: bat's blood, Saci's hat, Curupira's salsaparrilha bat, Iara's hair and a
			tear from Cuca. To make things even worse, next night will be a full moon, and if Tia Nastácia doesn't get
			cured until then, she'll sleep for 100 years! So, Pedrinho (Pete) and Emília (Emily) are sent to bring the
			ingredients and cure Tia Nastácia.

			Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch in English) is based on the works of Monteiro Lobato, a
			Brazilian writer. One or two players (in hot-seat mode) can choose to play either the boy Pedrinho (or Pete,
			in the English version of the books) or the rag doll Emília (Emily in the English version). The items they
			must gather are based on Brazilian folklore.

			Gameplay consists in basic side-scrolling/platforming. Either characters can jump (button 2), run (either
			pressing the D-pad twice to a direction, or holding a button and the D-pad to a direction), shoot (button
			1), and duck. The game has four levels (one for each ingredient, the last one with two of them), all set in
			the ranch, with indoor levels, underwater levels, caves and such.

			Each character starts with 3 lives. They have a health bar, which can be replenished by gathering items such
			as nests with eggs, or by freeing birds from cages. The enemies faced are most animals, such as bats, bugs,
			spiders, snakes, piranhas, jaguars and monkeys.

			All in game text is in Portuguese.</story>

			played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.

			You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods,
			and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball.
			Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the
			opponents.

			The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the
			value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are
			also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but
			these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become
			set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the
			pitch, in the direction it was going.

			You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random
			intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they
			can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved
			to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.

			A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period
			of time, and one freezes the opposition.</story>

		<story>Kujakuo is based on the comic by the same name, published in Young Jump in the late eighties and drawn by
			Makoto Ogino. It is a tale of the occult, centred around the buddhist monk Kujaku.

			In this game, Kujaku is sent out by his master, Ajari, to find out what has happened at the nearby temple of
			Hieizan. Upon arriving, after having fought his way through magical creatures and deadly warriors, he find
			his comrades slain. One of them, Kubira, is still holding on to his life, and before drawing his last
			breath, he utters the word "Izumo". Ajuri then sends Kujaku to the town of Izumo, where he encounters a
			deadly enemy of unknown origin.

			Kujakuo is part adventure game à la Déjà vu (or, since this is a Sega game, Hoshi o sagashite), part
			platform action. To get between the adventure parts, you must pass an action level, as well as a boss fight
			or two, just as in Cosmic Spacehead.

			The adventure part has you looking at a scenery, with a text box for descriptions and lines, and a set of
			verbs on the right. Use a cursor to point out specific objects for your verbs.

			In the platform levels, Kujaku can jump and shoot magic bolts. While the usual bolt is small, he can load up
			before releasing them, R-Type style. Pressing the pause button opens up the spell menu, for accessing more
			powerful magical spells. New spells can be learned throughout the game. Most spells are offensive, but some
			grant additional powers such as levitation. Each time a spell is activated, you use up your limited spirit
			energy. Enemies will, when killed, sometimes drop spheres that will raise your spirit energy, though.

			This game was remade into Spellcaster upon its release in the West.</story>

			a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.
			Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing

			Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the

			Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics
			(characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and
			gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several
			new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically

			on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

			Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and
			multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer,
			and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

			The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are
			added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some
			relate to a piece of music.

		<story>The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color
			graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what
			really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of
			the story and goal.

			Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang
			up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the
			land. This meant upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs
			you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would usually provide you with some nice
			equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but
			simply because it was the "right thing to do". The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most
			other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if
			it didn't belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting
			like in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.

			This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later,
			and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre.

			Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile
			monsters to kill, as well as a typical final "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find the Codex of
			Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.</story>

		<story>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with
			it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty
			shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of
			them must be completed in one sitting.

			The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics
			engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster and farther
			but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed
			down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the
			ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game
			allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to
			belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.

			Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be
			tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field.

			The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.

		<story>Virtua Fighter Animation is an one-on-one 2D fighting game based on the Virtua Fighter anime series. It
			has two game modes: story and versus.

			In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style cutscenes before and after each
			fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of them corresponding to one fight. The player starts
			controlling Akira Yuki, as as he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so they can be
			chosen in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available are Pai Chan, Jacky
			Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau Chan. In the final act, the player must fight
			against Dural.

			The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters to fight against the CPU. In
			the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed from the character selection.

			The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode
			shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger sprites). The
			Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter games, alternating between
			the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro sequence, with anime style cutscenes.

			In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting game, as the player can
			perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up), as well as some special maneuvers. The Game
			Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in the Master System version. The fights are
			regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this three possibilities happen:
			their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have less energy than the opponent if the time
			runs out.</story>

			Land's last hope.

			There are twelve locations in which Tom-Tom must venture through, including (but not limited to): the city
			of Wonder Land, Valley of Peace, The Coastal Town of Baraboro, The Mam Desert, and Pororo Islands. During
			his journey, he must defeat monsters with the sword that he got at the beginning of his adventure. These

			With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out
			in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit "mystery bricks",
			wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your
			path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of
			this kind – instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might
			bounce back in the corners.

			Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this
			game less linear than usual.

			Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from
			other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the "diamond ball", which destroys all blocks in its
			path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them

		<story>Xenon 2: Megablast is vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels,
			filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy
			grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use
			this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some
			upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

			The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical
			enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards
			when you keep pressing the down key.

			A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also famous for its soundtrack by British electronica group
			Bomb The Bass.</story>

		<story>Once long ago, the Kingdom of Y's fell under a reign of evil. But the Goddesses of Y's saved the Kingdom
			from ruin. Their feats were written in six magical books and hidden until the time the Goddesses would be
			needed again. A thousand years later, that time has come. You are Aron, a wanderer. An evil sorcerer named
			Dark Dekt is planning diabolical magic. And the Seer Sara is desperately looking for a swordsman to help her
			find the vanished six books of Y's. Now arm yourself and prepare for an adventure into the unknown. Where
			caverns and towers are filled with creatures and hoards of treasure. Where the strangest people have clues
			to tell you. Where your skill in combat depends on your reflexes. If you succeed, you'll have the power to
			call down the Goddesses. Fail, and Dark Dekt will rule the Kingdom under a reign of terror forever!</story>
