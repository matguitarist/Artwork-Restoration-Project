		<story>Aoi Blink is a side-scrolling platformer based on the TV anime series of the same name. The five levels
			are similarly built as the ones in Super Mario Bros. 3: they are divided into various areas which are
			reached through a map screen with branching paths. Those areas need to be solved to be able to walk further
			on the map.

			The speciality of this game is that the player can switch between three characters with different abilities
			on the fly, e.g. one can jump high and another has a better gun. Those are important to be able to solve the
			challenges the levels bring, mostly consisting of traditional platforming and avoiding/shooting enemies.
			However, the boss area at the end of the level map has to be opened with a master key. There is one hidden
			in every area.

			The three characters are based on characters of the series and change depending on the level. The health
			pool is shared between all characters and losing all hearts results in losing a life. Hearts can be refilled
			by collecting money which is left behind by killed enemies.</story>

		<story>Bonk's Adventure is a prehistoric platform game where you are in control of a large bald headed caveman,
			guiding him through the levels taking out all manner of strange prehistoric creatures that get in your way
			including King Drools henchmen - all in effort to free the captured/controlled residents of Moonland
			(bosses) - including the Princess Za from King Drool attempted take over.

			The game is not unlike other platform games of the era. Though it's unique in that you can climb walls and
			swing on rope with your teeth and your only method of attack is head butting enemies - straight forward or
			dive bomb style. The game starts off with simplistic point A to point B style, but focuses more on
			exploration in the later stages, which include finding hidden bonus areas.

			The game is also known for its trademark gameplay mechanism of 'spin attack', where Bonk floats through the
			air if you have the turbo button on. This can be used to float around the level and reach areas for
			extra/hidden items, but also as a method of attack as well. The game starts you off with 3 hearts, but
			allows you to increase this number when you find special heart container items, allowing Bonk to take a
			number of hits before dying.

			A variety of bonus stages can be found throughout the game, which provide bonus points upon completion and
			thus resulting in accumulating extra lives. Enemies themselves can be 'milked' for points in that you can
			keep 'bonking' their dead bodies and not letting them hit the ground. Spin attack is another method for
			doing this.</story>

			boxers. The tournament consists of four fights and a finale and each boxer can be controlled by a human
			player. The boxers have different statistics (strength, agility and endurance) which can be improved between
			fights with a training fight. Each boxer has four moves (left swing, right swing, uppercut and dodge) and a
			hit both depletes the opponent's energy bar and gives points. Similar to real boxing, those points are used
			to determine the winner if no boxer is knocked out during the regular rounds. A knockout happens when the
			energy runs out, but when the player mashes a button fast enough when the boxer is given a count, he stands
			up again with a partly replenished energy bar.

			Additionally there is also a side-scrolling fighting game included. Here the player walks from left to right

		<story>Double Dungeons is a solo dungeon crawler in the strictest sense. One or two players can explore
			pseudo-3D, maze-like dungeons (without auto-map feature, but with directions displayed on the screen) and
			fight the monsters populating them. The player(s) can choose to venture into any of the available 20
			dungeons. The dungeons have the same textures, but their layout varies; the higher is the number of the
			chosen dungeon, the more dangerous are its enemies. Two-player mode features a split screen; the two players
			start exploring the dungeon from different points.

			The basic gameplay is very simple. Enemies appear at specific points (they can also re-spawn), and must be
			defeated in order to proceed. The combat is turn-based at its core, though the turns follow very quickly,
			and the enemies will attack even if the player does nothing. Attacking is done simply by pressing a button;
			there are no other combat options.

			The player can find equipment and healing items (which can also be dropped by enemies). These can be used to
			restore the player character's HP outside of battles. Leveling up is completely automatic.

			There is no narrative in the game; the only story-related information comes in form of very short text
			intros to the different dungeons, along the lines of "the king wants to retrieve a treasure and sends a
			warrior into the dungeon" or comparable mission objectives.</story>

			enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total of 29 stages. The
			player can begin with one ship with two in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in
			reserve).

			Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to
			destroy. Others explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies
			drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that "wiggle" their way down the screen. Some enemies arrive
			in spherical "eggs" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to
			destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down
			the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen.
			Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit,
			making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies.

			Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When
			one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again
			and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While
			vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In addition, many different kinds

			only Shin. The game is similar to the better-known Ys games in many ways. As in Ys, the hero fights enemies
			simply by "bumping" into them. Defeated enemies produce money, which can be spent in villages to purchase
			weapons and various types of armor, and experience points. Once a set amount of those is accumulated, the
			hero gains a level.

			only in several cut-scenes) controlling a prototype CS-05 tank. The tank can freely be moved around the
			screen in any direction and the game scrolls along until the edge of the area is reached. The tank needs to
			destroy enemies and locate the exit. There are several weapons such as lasers, homing missiles, mines, a
			force field etc. The tank's turret can be locked into one position to shoot, so it is possible to strafe.
			Sometimes the player must destroy all the enemies or a boss to progress. The game has seven levels in totals
			and many parts of the levels are mazes.</story>

		<story>Military Madness is a futuristic turn-based strategy war game. The year is 2089 and the setting is
			Earth?s moon, which yields many important resources. While the governments of Earth bicker over their staked
			claims on the moon, the evil Axis Empire launches a lunar military campaign and takes over the moon, using
			its factories to produce advanced weaponry, the most devastating of which is the SAM (Supreme Atomic
			Missile). As commander of the Allied forces, it is the player?s responsibility to lead what?s left of the
			Allied armies in a desperate offensive against the Axis Empire on the lunar surface before they can use the
			SAM to destroy Earth.

			There are 32 maps (2 different campaigns with 16 maps each) to play through. In each map, the player must
			strategically defeat the outnumbering Axis forces either by destroying all enemy units or capturing the
			enemy base camp. There are many different units that both sides utilize - infantry, tanks, aircraft,
			artillery, and a few others that have specialized functions. Gameplay consists of moving units into
			positions that will gain the best advantage to attack the enemy, capitalizing on many factors, which include
			battle experience, terrain, support tactics, and - sometimes - pure luck.</story>

		<story>A very important discovery was recently made on the planet Laffra - ancient ruins at an excavation site,
			containing relics of another civilization, with technique that would surely benefit the great intergalactic
			Empire. But a mysterious organization that calls itself Mars began to stir unrest on the planet. The head of
			Imperial Scouts sends the hero, piloting a combat robot known as FW, into the depths of the ruins, to face
			the enemies and retrieve the precious knowledge...

			Out Live is a solo dungeon crawler; unlike most representatives of this genre, it is set in a sci-fi
			environment, and the player controls a giant robot rather than a medieval warrior. Most of the enemies are
			also machines and robots of different kinds.

			Before venturing into the dungeon, the player has access to various shops, where it is possible to repair
			the robot, buy weapons, protective shields, and items that restore the robot's energy. Most of the gameplay
			takes place in pseudo-3D, maze like underground complexes (without an auto-map, but with a compass feature).
			There, the game plays similarly to other dungeon crawlers: random enemies must be fought in turn-based
			fashion; they drop money and award the player character with experience points.

			A somewhat unusual feature is double leveling: the robot has two independent levels, for attack and for
			defense. The experience points the robot receives after battles also come in two different flavors.
			Depending on the enemy type and outcome of the battle, the robot receives different amounts of experience.
			The leveling-up itself is automatic, increasing maximum energy, attack and defense parameters.</story>

			There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move
			a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations
			there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks
			one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately

			arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by
			forming a stack, for example)

			The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of
			2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets
			on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the

		<story>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay. You
			control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

			The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without
			firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of
			energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in
			your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called
			"The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any
			enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an
			offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type,
			since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in
			order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main
			gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser
			beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one
			follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

			The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien
			movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi
			mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the
			fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with
			intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes,
			without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</story>

			release) by walking to its edge. However, map layout and locations are almost identical with those of the
			PC-88 version, hence being completely different from those of the MSX release.

			The most significant change - which is unique to this version - is the addition of a RPG system. Whereas in
			the two other versions the battles didn't serve any other purpose but challenge the player and impede the
			progress of the story, in the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16) release they are essential to Laila's character
			growth. Like in most RPGs, Laila can now gain levels, which enhance her parameters and make her stronger in

		<story>The game is based on the eponymous manga (sometimes transliterated as Susa no Oh) by Go Nagai. The
			protagonist is a seemingly ordinary teenager named Susa, who discovers that he contains within himself
			another persona, the destructive Japanese god Susanoo. The game's story begins right where the manga ended
			(with a cliffhanger): Susa faces his rival Uryu, who causes him to unleash the power of Susanoo, devastating
			the world and releasing evil spirits that take it in their possession. Having returned to his normal self,
			Susa has to find his sweetheart Yukishiro and other friends, and figure out a way to undo the damage he has
			inflicted on the world.

			Susano? Densetsu is notable for implementing a setting and gameplay themes unusual for Japanese RPGs of its
			time. Among those is a day/night cycle, which influences the appearance of monsters on the world map as well
			as schedules of characters in the towns (for example, shops are closed at night). It is also one of the
			first Japanese RPGs in which enemies wander around visibly on the world map, sometimes surrounding the
			player, Ultima-style, and can be avoided.

			The battle system is also reminiscent of Ultima, featuring free movement on the top-down battle screen. The
			fights are held in fast-paced turn-based style; to pause the fight, the player has to bring up the menu and
			select a command. Similarly to Emerald Dragon, action points are spent when moving and/or selecting
			commands.

			Later in the game Susa teams up with two other characters; he can also recruit mercenaries to help him in
			battles. Characters learn the so-called "ESP powers" when leveling up, which are equivalent to magic spells.

			defense, zone defense or a mix between the two) which can be set before the match or during interceptions.

			During the matches, the player controls the ball carrier when in offense and manually switches between
			athletes when in defense. Passes can be performed in a high or low variation. While most of the match is
			shown in a slightly heightened side-scrolling perspective, the game switches to a close-up view during a
			penalty throw or a dunking try. Here the player needs to press a button at the correct timing for a
			successful throw. When a defense athlete is nearby during a during maneuver, he has the opportunity to block

		<story>Victory Run is an arcade racer based on the Paris-Dakar rally. The gameplay is similar to OutRun, with
			your car appearing near the bottom of the screen, and a course made of scaling sprites laid out ahead.

			At the start of the race, you choose how many spare engines, tires, brakes, and so on to take with you on
			the rally. As you finish each segment, you have to decide to use those parts so that you can repair your car
			so you can complete the race.</story>

		<story>Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is very
			similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes
			and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed
			areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area
			the player's pointer can move along.

			The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will
			weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The
			goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.

			As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers
			no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</story>

		<story>W Ring: The Double Rings is a shoot 'em up developed and published by Naxat Soft for the PC Engine
			platform. The player makes their way across horizontal levels collecting power-ups from fallen foes.

			The game has three difficulty modes which determine the amount of enemies and their health: Beginner, Normal
			and Expert.
			Each power-up provides a different weapon to the player depending on the color, and collecting subsequent
			power-ups increases the power of that weapon. If the player switches colored power-ups, they'll acquire the
			stronger versions of those power-ups. If the player gets hit, they'll lose the current power-ups they have;
			if they don't have a power-up, they'll lose a life.</story>

		<story>Wai Wai Mahjong ("wai wai" is Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound of a noisy/busy location) is a Mahjong
			game in which the player plays against various cartoonish opponents including a racing car driver and a nun.
			The game is one-on-one - unlike actual Mahjong which is generally played with four players - due to the
			limitations of Mahjong simulators back in the 8-bit/16-bit era.

			Wai Wai Mahjong is the second Mahjong game for the PC Engine (after Sengoku Mahjong) and was only released

			the ball at a slight angle to adjust its trajectory and which direction to hit the ball towards, before
			hitting the requisite power gauge at the right point to send the ball flying as close to the hole as

		<story>In Wonder Momo you play as Momo, an actress playing the lead role in a kid's show about a crime-fighting
			heroine that puts the hurt on several alien monsters and assorted criminals.

			Set in the stage of the "Namco Theater", the game plays as an action side-scroller in which you progress
			across each stage kicking the snot out of all the enemies you run across. By collecting the right power-up
			you can transform into Wonder Momo for a limited time, who can perform ranged attacks with a hoola-hoop and
			is more powerful than regular Momo.

			Not only must you clear the enemies of each stage, but also please the crowd with your performances, being
			wary of perverts that attempt to take pictures of your underwear whenever you attack (Momo shows quite a bit
			of leg whenever she "kicks high") which results in blinding flashes that stun Momo and leave her open to an
			attack.</story>

		<story>Zipang is a puzzle game released exclusively for the PC Engine in 1990. It is based on the movie of the
			same name (which in turn is an antiquated word for the nation of Japan): a comedy action movie from director
			Kaizo Hayashi that was loosely based on Japanese mythology and was also released in 1990. The same movie
			would also be the inspiration for the NES game Kabuki Quantum Fighter, which in Japan was named Jigoku
			Gokurakumaru: the name of the movie's protagonist.

			Zipang plays similarly to Solomon's Key/Solomon no Kagi by Tecmo. The player character can destroy and place
			blocks, using them as platforms to get higher up in the stage. The player needs to remove enemies in their
			way and collect necessary items along the way to the exit. After each stage, a prefecture of Japan is placed
			on a map of Japan: upon completing them all, the game is over.</story>
