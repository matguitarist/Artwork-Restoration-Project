		<story>4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the popular power-boat racing game, Hydro Thunder. In
			this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in
			all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night, rain/sunshine variations. The game
			includes the standard championship, practice race, and 2-player modes.

			The thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and
			braking, but in finding the "boost" power-ups that lie around the tracks. Each boost icon adds a few seconds
			of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of his or her
			truck dramatically. Without the boost power-ups, the player has no hope of winning a race.</story>

			In addition to the on-line mode of play, there is a single player career mode. The career mode gives you a

		<story>Charge 'N Blast is a shooting game where you play as one of three marines who have to rid the earth of
			alien scum. The gameplay is similar to Cabal, you move left and right dodging enemies while charging up you
			weapons to blast them away.

			There are three different marines you can choose from, each with their own set of weapons. As usual there is
			the balanced character (Johnny Rock), a weaker but faster one (Pamela Hewitt) and a slower but stronger one
			(Nicholas Woods).

			You can choose to play in one player mode, time attack or two player mode. The missions are broken up into
			small areas where you have to kill all enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a
			boss character such as a giant insect or a Godzilla-like monster.

			Use the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot and aim with analog stick. There
			are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of enemies. For example the single
			missiles for far away targets and torpedoes for underwater enemies.

			You can fire your weapon continuously, but this doesn't do as much damage compared to a fully charged shot.
			Charging each shot means you have to aim a little more carefully, but you'll especially need this in the
			later levels. You can dodge enemies with the L and R buttons.</story>

		<story>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way
			through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver
			passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians
			(which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their
			destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance
			and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short.

			In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up
			customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and
			customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer
			arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount
			of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the
			game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is
			encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a
			crazy boost to speed up more quickly.

			Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on
			closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed
			amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S
			for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new
			course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics
			and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad
			Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</story>

			Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister
			series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which
			to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas.
			Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find
			"plugs" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough
			plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed.
			In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan,
			although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than
			the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors.</story>

			The player controls two different characters: Takeshi Kuranari, a simple, normal Japanese teenager, and a

			2050, four pilots have set off, each carrying a mysterious stone. The stones are said to be the only way to
			destroy Medallion once and for all. The player can choose to complete the journey for any of the four
			pilots.

			Giga Wing is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up. Up to two players must steer their planes around enemy
			bullets and destroy everything in their path with only a limited amount of lives. When tapping the A button,
			the main gun is fired. Holding the button activates the Reflect Force. The B button fires a bomb from a
			limited stock to become temporarily invincible. Power-ups can be collected to increase the bomb and life
			stock or enhance the main gun's fire power.

			Scoring works by using the Reflect Force to repel enemy shots. Once the shots hit an enemy, medals appear in
			their place. When these are collected, the score multiplier increases.

			There are two game modes, arcade and score attack. Arcade plays just like the original coin-op game, and
			score attack lets the player choose a stage and fight for the highest score there. In this mode, the player
			has unlimited lives, however the score multiplier will reset once the player dies or uses a bomb.</story>

			battles his way back to his sweetheart. The 3D real-time strategy game was originally created for Sega's
			Japanese fiber optic service net@, then ported to the Dreamcast but never released outside of Japan. Ported
			once more to the PC, Hundred Swords finally reached North America and Europe.

			Single soldiers? Don't bother. You control complete units of five to 20 men gathering round a commander.
			Micro-management is reduced, instead it's paper, scissors, stone: cavalry is strong against mages, mages are
			strong against infantry, and so on. Officers can recruit new soldiers in barracks, as long as your mines
			supply enough of two resources. Your tasks on the small 3D playfields vary from flight to defence to all-out
			attack, sometimes with time limits. Depending on your success, you are awarded shells, magical items that
			can be equipped to the commanders and activated in battle for a short-term benefit. Commanders will also
			gain experience, making them tougher and able to control more soldiers.

			In the single-player campaign, anime stills and 3D cut-scenes tell the story of prince Larf and his gang.
			When the adventure's through, a mission mode let's you play single battles with units not available in the
			main storyline. Up to four players can also link together via network or internet and test their skill
			against each other.</story>

		<story>Licensed by snooker player Jimmy White, this game is a simulation of not only the British game of
			snooker, but also of the three main variations of pool.

			The game is viewed in detailed 3D, allowing you to rotate the table at all angles, either from overhead or
			using the cue position as a base. Taking a shot involves setting the exact pace and spin of it, and
			considering what each contact will do to the position of the cue ball, and any balls you may wish to pot
			afterwards. In the snooker mode playing accurate 'safety' shots (to prevent your opponent scoring) becomes
			important as well).

			In each mode there are 10 computer opponents, and matches can consist of up to 9 frames. A trick-shot editor
			is also included, allowing you to practice shots and set up challenges. Replays and an undo mode are also
			included.

			Bonus games are included as well - darts, draughts, a fruit machine, and even a remake of Dropzone, a
			Commodore 64 game from the same programmer.</story>

		<story>1500 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain's decision at the end of that game has
			finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle
			built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a
			lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the "insolence"
			of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired
			it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and
			banishes him into the Abyss. There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God
			recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature
			of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's
			underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...

			Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of
			vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game
			from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific
			abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards.
			Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific
			locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to
			new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.
			Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to
			defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking it's soul.
			Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked
			gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as
			attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul
			Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.

			The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of
			Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes requires the use of gained specific abilities.
			Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are "block puzzles", requiring the placement
			of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to
			out-of-reach areas.</story>

			The game follows the standard fighting gameplay, but different from X-Men vs. Street Fighter you now have to
			make up a squad of three characters instead of two. The other characters can be summoned for assist attacks
			and there is also a duo team attack to control two characters for a brief time, along with the ability to
			perform super moves where the characters team up.

			Options include a straight arcade battle, 4-player tag modes (Dreamcast version only), a survival mode (much
			like Street Fighter Alpha 3) and a training mode. The PlayStation version does not have the 4-player tag
			mode and also reduces the second character to an assist role, but in addition introduces a "crossover" mode
			where tag-team play with identical teams is possible.

			For Marvel the cast of playable characters includes Spider Man, Captain America, Venom, Hulk, Gambit, War
			Machine, Wolverine, Gold War Machine (secret character), Hyper Venom (secret character), Orange Hulk (secret
			character) and Onslaught (secret character). The Capcom side offers Chun-Li, Ryu, Zangief, Morrigan
			Aensland, Captain Commando, Megaman (Rockman in Asia), Strider Hiryu, Jin Saotome, Roll (secret character),
			Lilith-Mode Morrigan (secret character) and Shadow Lady (secret character). There is also a large number of
			special partners that can be summoned.</story>

		<story>Golden Logres is another pinball simulator by LittleWing. A sequel to both Tristan and Crystal Caliburn,
			the game features three tables based on the Arthurian legends: Camelot, Land's End and Fisher King. After
			completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to
			test the last two tables and prepare to the full game.

			In Camelot, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of
			the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners
			list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the
			adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then
			hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he
			assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears
			over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game
			moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the
			ball in the quest hole.

			In the second table called Land's End, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the
			bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts
			after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the
			lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and "myst" hole. Lancelot must lift the curse
			that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on "CASTLE", and receive a
			gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the
			Green Knight by hitting the "ERRANTRY" ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery
			from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game
			switches back to Camelot automatically.

			In the final Fisher King table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three
			guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to
			Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights: Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the
			Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the "LONGINUS" spot targets,
			and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the
			ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the
			castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur's sin, that became a monster after his death, by
			shooting the beast lane turning on the "BEAST" lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights
			retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding
			with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the "HOLY GRAIL" letters at the center. A multiball starts
			after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to
			Camelot.</story>

		<story>Psychic Force 2012, the sequel to Psychic Force, is a one-on-one fighting game with a twist. The matches
			take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D
			arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty,
			Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack.
			The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using
			special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity
			of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.

			Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use,
			mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode
			using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two
			groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several
			neutral psychics with ties to members in either group.

			The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from the first game
			(Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special battles to learn
			other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It also lowers the
			overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the shield can now
			optionally be enabled with a single button). Of course, the graphics were notably degraded.</story>

			moves through the level.

			As most of the other new-style SHMUPs, Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick: getting close to enemies or shots without
			actually being hit is called "buzzing" and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship's rate
			of fire is rather slow by default and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then
			keeping moving horizontally - as soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal
			again.

			As in most other of the new Japanese style of shoot'em'ups, there are usually an extremely high number of
			enemy shots on the screen. All these factors combine to make learning precise control a central part of the
			game.</story>

		<story>The third game in the Quake series is a departure from the previous games, focusing exclusively on
			multiplayer arena fighting with no story-driven singleplayer part - directly competing with Epic Games that
			did the same with the contemporary Unreal Tournament.

			The offline part takes the player through a number of one-on-one and team-based challenges against
			AI-controlled opponents, slowly ranking upwards in difficulty, as the character of the player's choosing.
			Compared to the previous titles, the colours and general design of the game are much brighter and it shakes
			off the dominant shades of brown and grey the previous titles in the series were known for. The player's
			arsenal consists of new and familiar, but redesigned weapons, including a gauntlet (melee attacks) and a
			machine gun as the spawn weapons, a shotgun, plasma gun, lightning gun, rocket launcher, railgun and BFG.
			Each weapon has specific advantages, ranging from the amount of damage to reloading times and the ability to
			hit-scan opponents.

			The different arenas are also filled with health bubbles, complete sets of armour and armour shards, the
			well-known Quad Damage power-up, ammunition, and specials such as Mega Health, Haste, Invisibility, a
			powerful Battlesuit, and more. As with the other Quake games, it is known for its freedom in movement.
			Advanced players using techniques such as rocket jumping, strafing and circle jumping to quickly get around
			areas. The game offers more speed than Quake 2, but it is not as fast as the original Quake. Not everything
			was kept - the double jumping from the previous titles was removed for instance, but replaced with new
			tricks.

			The singleplayer part only serves as a diversion for the online multiplayer options, with modes such as
			duel, team deathmatch (TDM), capture the flag (CTF) and more. As with Quake II, the vanilla version of the
			game was eventually heavily tweaked by the players' community with all-new tournament features (including
			voting, referees, banning, netcode updates), as it was used in professional Pro Gaming tournaments for

			Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13
			tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is
			possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There
			are also 4 levels of realism to choose from.

			There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you
			complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where
			you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with
			live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a
			time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and
			shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in
			hard-to-reach places.

			In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking
			them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to
			temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to

			Like Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series, it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro

			in 3D, thus allowing for more control over one's character in the ring. Also unlike Punch-Out!!, players can
			choose whichever boxer they want from a rather large selection of characters.

			One unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses
			(like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a
			new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much

			notebook, which presents players with a series of challenges. At the start, only one location - a Japanese

			Catching fish not only opens up new locations, but also gives access to new types of lures, reels and lines,
			and rods, which in turn allow more successful fishing. A fishing session begins with a photo-realistic
			first-person view of the location created through combining digitized images with some animation, like for a
			waterfall or swaying trees, as well as disturbances of the water surface that hint at the best places for
			casting. Once the line is cast and a fish moves near the lure, the view switches to a 3D underwater view,

			The final installment of the Resident Evil series for the Playstation, Resident Evil 3 takes place during
			the events of Resident Evil 2. The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the
			undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. As Jill "master of
			unlocking" Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil), you must find a way
			out of the zombie-infested remains of the city alive. Along the way, you'll interact with and receive help
			from three heavily armed Umbrella mercenaries who have also become stranded in Raccoon City thanks to the
			incompetence of their employer. Standing in the way of your group's last escape are a horde of flesh-eating
			zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is
			determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill.

			A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis possesses the same
			maneuverability as Jill allowing him to run (faster than you, in fact), use firearms (such as a rocket
			launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of
			that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we've come to know and... well, know from Umbrella's
			ultimate bio-weapons.

			Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters
			on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the
			Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, improvements include
			auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows you to avoid enemy attacks by pressing a
			button a second before they strike. Another addition is Jill's ability to create different kinds of
			ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. Compared to
			Resident Evil 2, the amount of available ammunition and healing items has been significantly decreased,
			making the game more difficult. The variety of zombie citizens has also been made more diverse.

			The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen
			resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at
			16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another welcome addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as
			well as the door loading animation.

			The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary
			mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the
			Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.</story>

			1. Roadster Trophy – The player starts by selecting one of the available racers and is given a sum of money
			that must be used to acquire a car. There are 3 divisions in which the player can compete on with the 3rd
			being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to participate; the 1st being the most difficult
			one and needing a higher amount of money in order to participate. More money can be earned by winning the
			races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or upgrade the ones that are already in possession.

			Multi-Player – Multi-player mode supports up to 2 human players that can compete in any of the available
			circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen.

			Quick Race – In Quick Race the player can select the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions, and race
			against 7 more CPU controlled players.

			Time Trial – Like Quick Race mode, the player can also select here the racer, car, circuit and weather
			conditions but without the competition of the other modes, the player races against time for as many laps as

			controller can also be used if you do not have the maracas controller, which is sold separately.

			The music in the game comes from a wide variety of sources. Some of the songs are traditional samba music,

			Using sonar the player can cruise around the lake until he find a good fishing spot. Besides the location
			the player can also pick the month, time of day and weather in which he wants to fish. All these factors are
			calculated when it comes to determining what kind of fish he or she is likely to catch. To aid the player
			there's 100 different kinds of lures to fish with.

			The game is meant to be played with the special fishing rod controller.

			There are two game modes: free fishing and tournament mode. In the first you can do what you wish and try to
			improve on your own records. In the latter mode you have to compete against NPCs or another player. There
			are various tiers of difficulty.</story>

		<story>Sega Rally 2 is the sequel to Sega's hit arcade game, Sega Rally. This game, like it's predecessor, is
			based on Rally racing. Rally racing is unique in that races take place on both race tracks and off-road
			courses. The courses in this game reflect this nicely. Some take place in the desert or forest, others take
			place in cities.

			The cars in this game are all actual rally cars, with manufacturers from Europe and Japan both well
			represented. You do not get to see very many of them at one time, however, since rally races are typically
			time-based events. In this game, you are not competing directly against the other cars, you simply have to
			have the best time through the course. So, during any race you will usually see a handful of other cars on
			the track.

			Sega Rally 2 contains several modes of play. The first mode is the simple arcade mode of play. Here, you
			race in 4 courses, one right after another. The second mode is the 10 year championship. In this mode you
			race on 16 courses, and can make modifications to your car between races. Finally, there is a 2-person split
			screen mode for head-to-head competition.</story>

		<story>Sega Tetris is an officially licensed Tetris game originally made for arcades that can be played in both
			single player and multi player modes. The game uses polygonal graphics with animated backgrounds. As
			progress through the game is made these change and take the player to numerous different settings.

			When playing alone the game is very much true to the original Tetris but with some differences. The game is
			played with a joystick for moving the blocks around as they fall and two buttons to rotate them left and
			right. As the game's level is raised the speed of the falling block will also increase and since it's an
			arcade game it will reach a high pace relatively early. One addition to the game is a slot machine and the
			symbol it stops on depends on the number of lines cleared. By matching all the three wheels the player will
			get a large bonus.

			The two player versus mode adds special attacks to the gameplay and these are activated by clearing lines.
			Clearing two lines will lead to a joint attack where two stuck together blocks will fall while clearing
			three lines will lead to a long block falling. By creating a tetris (clearing four lines) stacked lines will
			rise from the bottom of the playfield. Some attacks come from clearing multiple lines that are apart from
			each other. This includes a missile attack that destroys block and a K.O. attack that knocks out the
			opponent preventing him from controlling the blocks for a short while. There is also a four player mode
			where two cabinets are connected. On the Dreamcast version the multiplayer mode can be played online.

		<story>That day in November when the snow turned to rain. Ryu Hazuki arrives home just in time to see his father
			killed by Lan Di, a man Ryu's father obviously knew very well. Ryu attempts to stop Lan Di, but is
			effortlessly beaten to within an inch of his life. After recovering from his injuries Ryu sets out to track
			down his father's murder as well as uncover his family's secrets and the mystery of the Phoenix and Dragon
			mirrors that Lan Di seeks.

			Much of Shenmue's gameplay involves talking to Ryu's friends and the various people around town, hoping to
			find hints or clues that lead to the next step in the story. Any details Ryu learns are written down in his
			notebook for future review. Ryu can buy items from stores or try his luck with capsule toy machines, but the
			vast majority of items you can buy have no purpose outside of filling out your inventory screen. Ryu can
			also visit an arcade and play arcade accurate versions of Hang-On and Space Harrier as well as games like
			darts and pool.

			Ryu is a trained martial artist, and while a true martial artist knows it is better to avoid a fight,
			sometimes it is still necessary. Ryu can train his moves, either by repeatedly doing them while training, or
			by sparing with his friend Fuku-san. Fighting plays like a simplified Virtua Fighter game, although with
			toned down air juggling. Ryu's training also gives him heightened reflexes, and sometimes during a cutscene
			the player will have only a moment to press a button (displayed onscreen) to get Ryu out of danger. Failing
			an input prompt is not always fatal, but whether Ryu survives or not depends on the danger he was in.

			Included with the game is the Shenmue Passport disc. On this disc players can receive tutorials about
			various aspects of the game like minigames or the battle system, watch cutscenes they've already seen in the
			game, and listen to music from the game. This disc also includes the option to go online to a special site

			of Yokosuka, trade uncommon items found in the game for even rarer items only available on the passport, and

			to exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of the Chaos Emeralds. In their
			own ways five heroes will do what they can to save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world.

			The player can select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each has their own
			unique version of each level. Sonic's levels involve racing through a level as quickly as possible,
			destroying any robots along the way. Tails can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic's
			except that he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can't charge up ramps or run as quickly as
			Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to
			avoid being captured by a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to maneuver
			robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets at once, chaining together attacks
			and earning a higher score and more time on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and
			destroy it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching for his lost
			frog. Big's levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting; he just fishes. Each character can find
			items that increase their abilities as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home
			along lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the story is unlocked after all
			other characters have been completed.

			Additionally each of the characters can visit the Chao garden where they can raise baby Chaos. By petting,
			feeding, and showing animals found in levels to the Chaos they can grow stronger, and optionally be put into
			races against other Chaos. As well each level in the game has additional objectives that can be completed to
			acquire extra emblems, although the emblems don't do anything in this version of the game. Finally at one
			time it was possible to go online and download additional levels and bonuses in the game, such a Christmas
			theme for Station Square and a level sponsored by AT&amp;T, but since SegaNet shut down this is no longer

			Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character
			designs.

			Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's new invention when an imposter
			Spider-Man steals the device. Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind
			the device's theft.

			This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other
			characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.

			Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized. He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or
			ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web
			for extra oomph, or building a protective shield. His web supply is limited though and he must find new
			cartridges or risk running out. The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features. Spider-Man can cling
			to any wall or ceiling. This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many
			sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.

			Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web. By combining these with direction
			and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank
			enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things. There are a number of
			boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.

			Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types
			to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.

			There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes
			and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</story>

		<story>European soccer game based around the UEFA license. Effectively a merger between Rage software's Striker
			franchise and playstation/dreamcast evolution with Infogrames' UEFA license.

			UEFA Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the
			player was tested for skills in order to unlock game modes.

			The game featured many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it's primary game
			tournament mode was focused around European clubs.

			In addition to simple and quick selection of a 'friendly match' the game supported the following
			tournaments:

			Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams. In
			round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice. The
			top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four
			teams. The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties.

			National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests. Belgium and
			Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way. This was likely
			because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the
			license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they
			automatically qualified as a result). The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home
			and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals. Group ties
			resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded. The best of out of all those teams which placed second in
			the groups also goes forward. The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four
			going through to the finals.

			National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers. The remaining
			16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups
			of four, playing each group member once. The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis
			and Finals. Penalty shootouts settle ties.

			Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations -
			completion of each cup unlocks the next territory.

			8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition. The game also supported generic league and knockout
			tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches.

			Live commentary was from Ron Atkinson and Jonathan Pearce.</story>

			switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer. However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect. Positive and
			Negative charges are represented by red and blue. Neo's head can act as a positive or negative pole. This is
			called his magnogimmick. Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can
			pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as
			pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums. Enemies also come in red and blue and
			can pulled pulled in to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly.

			You must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao Park and defeat Pinki.

			There is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based around proper use of the
			magnogimmick. It's something like the VR missions in the Metal Gear series.</story>

		<story>Tech Romancer is a 3D beat-em-up with a difference; the difference being that, rather than controlling
			one of a set of martial artists, you control one of a set of huge robots (or mecha). Ranging from the absurd
			(A huge, spherical mech with a boat and bus for feet, a house for a head, train for one arm and office
			building with wrecking ball for another) to the "typical" anime styled mecha (Beam-firing chest gem,
			detatchable rocket-powered fists) to a more westernised idea of a mech (Huge, sluggish, equipped with heavy
			cannon, rockets, missiles and land-mines), you're bound to find at least one which suits you.
			The gameplay takes part in large, 3D arenas, usually dotted with buildings and such, which you'll no doubt
			be happy to learn are destructable (and often contain powerups).
			The game controls consist of two attack buttons, one block and one jump. You have a special bar, which works
			pretty much the same as any other special bar - once it's full (up to a maximum of 3 times) you can pull off

			then you'll start taking hefty damage even when blocking. The life and time-bars are self-explanatory, and
			there's also the special-weapon inventory, which can hold up to five special weapons at a time (these are
			picked up from the battlefield or stolen off the enemy).
			The main single-player mode is a story mode, which is completely different for each character and, for most
			characters at least, branches many ways, often with multiple endings depending on choices made and targets
			met.
			To put it simply, this is a quirky pick-up-and-play fighting game with an extensive single-player mode.

		<story>Need for Speed returns to dirt racing again in this sequel to Need for Speed: V-Rally. The most
			significant differences are the track editor, improved graphics, and new game modes. There are 84 tracks and
			the game supports multiplayer with up to four players. This second installment comes with four game modes:
			an arcade mode for casual rally fans, a championship mode for people who want to compete against other rally
			cars for a title, a trophy mode, and a time trial mode.

			It features 16 different cars in three categories: World Rally Cars (Peugeot 206, Hyundai Coupe, Mitsubishi
			Lancer, Toyota Corolla, Subaru Impreza, Ford Focus, SEAT CÃ³rdoba, Å koda Octavia), 2L kit-cars (Peugeot
			306, CitroÃ«n Xsara, SEAT Ibiza, Renault Megane, Vauxhall Astra) and 1.6L kit-cars (CitroÃ«n Saxo, Peugeot
			106, Nissan Micra). A number of bonus cars can be unlocked as well by completing certain modes, such as
			winning the European or the World Championship.

			In the arcade mode you race against three opponents on the race track; whoever reaches the finish line first
			after a series of laps wins the stage. However, the main goal in a stage is to reach the next checkpoint
			before the countdown timer stops. Several stages form a level, for which you receive a total of three
			credits. Every time you fail to reach a checkpoint before the time runs out the race stops and you can use a
			credit to restart that particular stage. If there are no credits left, the entire level must be restarted.
			The trophy mode is a bit different. While winning a stage is still done by beating three opponents directly
			on the race track, to claim the trophy you have to register the best overall result, calculated by summing
			up all the stages' times.

			The championship mode is designed after the FIA World Rally Championship, where drivers compete for points.
			The European championship is divided into eight rounds, while the World and the Expert championships each
			have twelve. Every round has two (European, World) or three stages (Expert). This is the only mode where the
			car gets damaged if handled badly, but it can be repaired at the service park between stages in the
			following areas: engine, gear box, brakes, steering and suspensions. You only have 30 minutes, so if your
			car is seriously messed up you will not be able to restore it to a 100% condition for the next stage. At the
			end of the round the total time for all stages is compared between racers and the first six positions in the
			standings get a number of points based on their performance (for example the fastest gets 10 points, 2nd
			place gets 6 points, and so on). Whoever has the most points after all the rounds becomes the new champion.

			In the track editor the track is represented by a single line or ribbon. You can edit the curves and change
			the inclines or declines of each track piece. The only restriction is that trackpieces cannot overlap, so
			for example you cannot make an 8-shaped track. When playing the track, scenery is added procedurally
			depending on the curves and inclines and which country is selected. The 84 default tracks make use of the
			same engine.</story>

			piece preview settings.

			The sound and graphics generally follow a modern urban/industrial theme, with five techno music choices,
			including a variation of the classic Tetris "Karinka". The 3D backgrounds are basic but shift viewpoint as
			you advance in levels.

			The Battle mode offers two to four player multiplayer. One player starts off flagged, and blocks push up
			from the bottom as other players make lines. Once he makes enough lines himself the flag moves to another
			player. Difficulty is set independently allowing for handicaps.

			Unfortunately, you can't play the battle mode against the computer. There's also no VMU support for saving

			accomplish certain objectives. The objectives in each mission vary widely. In some missions, you must drive
			an army truck and shoot things, in some you fly helicopters to pick up and drop off objects, and in some you
			must race against computer controlled vehicles.

			There is a story line that ties together the missions in single player mode. A coalition of old toys has
			started a rebellion against the new toys in the house. An evil Teddy Bear, the Toy Commander, is leading
			this rebellion. It's your job to stop him. In each mission, your basic goal is to complete the task in as
			short a time as possible. If you meet a certain time goal, the mission is completed. By completing 4
			missions, you get to challenge the Boss character in the room. If you successfully destroy the boss, he will

			as a shield, and hurl back any flying enemy vehicle in the game, including even the most giant of enemy
			battle cruisers. When thrown, the enemy cuts a path of destruction across the entire screen, causing

			difficulty level, which will cut more slack to the inexperienced player, while attempting to punish the

			In addition to the original Arcade mode the home version of the game includes a Story mode, which adds fully
			voiced cutscenes, additional endings and bosses throughout the game, and Arranged Mode, which is just like
			the arcade mode, but is limited to Normal difficulty, no continues, and only two lives, and serves as a
			challenge to the most experienced players.

			The PS2 port includes a new opening movie, story mode and CG sequences. TH44 Faintear is now a player

			any wish to the one that finds it. Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus must
			fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels.

			The game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to
			shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area,
			a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the
			destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves
			can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special
			"boss" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.

			Each player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found.
			The game features an arcade mode in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well
			as a 2-player Vs mode and a story mode chronicling Ran's journey.</story>

			scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one
			area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When
			you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called capture the flag,
			every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point.

			The 4th game mode is probably the most innovative one, it's called assault. These are real missions, like
			you have to attack an enemy base and destroy something in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and
			the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, like 5 or 10 minutes. If you were
			successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only
			has as much time as you needed to attack.

			All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu

		<story>Wild Metal Country is an action game in which one of five little tanks can be selected to control.
			Tank-like machines have gone wild on the three different planets of the Tehric system and the player's job
			is to defeat them.

			The battles take place in desolate mountain environments. The big differences in altitude play an important
			role in the game. In the single player mode, complete levels by collecting 8 colored power cores, which are
			defended by the machines, and returning them to one of several hovering stores. The player has an infinite
			amount of lives. The weaponry consists of 8 types of missiles and 4 types of mines. Help is received from a
			pair of helicopters that drop ammo and provide healing.

			The two tracks of the tank are operated independently. For example, make a quick spin by going forward with
			one track and backwards with the other. Moreover the turret can be turned in any direction. The camera
			always moves with the turret sometimes diverting the view towards the camera. The angle of the turret and
			the distance the rockets travel can be changed. The tank can only be controlled using the keyboard.

			Noteworthy aspects of the game are: the physics modelling, the 3D engine and the amount of freedom the
			player has (no time constraints etc.).</story>

		<story>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands
			on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team
			17's WORMNET.

			For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an
			artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite
			wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only
			can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from
			bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep.

			Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and
			their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.

			Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a
			huge change.</story>
