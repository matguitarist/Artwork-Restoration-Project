        <story>This puzzle-game is the successor to Kwirk. The player has to guide a small potato to the exit of each
            level, which is made difficult by a number of obstacles. Crates have to be pushed out of the way or into
            holes to make them traversable. Difficulty is increased by the fact that there are crates and holes of
            several different shapes and sizes and many levels contain different types of spinning doors.

            The game features four different modes of play: Beginners Mode in which the basics are explained and the
            player receives hints on how to solve each level; Practice Mode that lets the player choose the size of the
            levels which are then randomly picked; Puzzle Mode in which the player has to complete 40 levels and
            receives a score depending on the time it took him to complete a level; and finally Action Mode, which is
            basically a story mode containing two stories. The game also features a password system and four different

            real sport, the goal is to knock the opponent out of the ring. However, it is not a particularly realistic
            interpretation of sumo, playing much like a traditional 1-vs-1 fighting game. There are grabs, throws, and
            special moves, and the player can also win by knockout by draining the opponent's stamina. There is a
            single-player mode that follows the story of protagonist Harimanada, as well as a versus mode for one or two
            players where any of 15 characters can be used.</story>

        <story>The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer based on the movie of the same name. The player takes
            the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different
            parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest or the graveyard, which are basic platform levels: the player moves
            from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. In contrast to the other versions of the game
            he has weapons to his disposal, e.g. a throwing knife. Other differences are a unique level design and
            another health system: Gomez has five hearts which practically act like a life meter because every hit only
            takes away a part of a heart.</story>

        <story>The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a side-scrolling platformer based on the second animated
            TV series The Addams Family (1992). The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters
            throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion,
            e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards:
            Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies.

            This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams Family - it features the same
            storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the SNES
            version of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional
            power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.</story>

        <story>Alleyway is a basic Breakout variant. As Mario, the player must control a "podship" and deflect the ball
            towards the mass of blocks. Hitting a block will either weaken or destroy it. Once all the blocks are
            destroyed, the level is complete.

            The game uses a small number of repeating tables along with twists such as horizontal rotation, periodical
            vertical drop of the entire mass of blocks, etc.</story>

        <story>Once upon a time, there was a huge war between the humans and the demons. After prolonged battles, both
            sides came to an agreement and established peace. But now, things start changing. A demon cult is becoming
            popular, and demons no longer wish to live in peace with the humans. Only you, the Hero of the game
            (nameless), aided by the Heroine (also nameless) and other friends, is able to bring peace back to the
            planet.

            The Heroine has a special ability: she can talk to the demons you meet in random battles and persuade them
            to join your party. You can store those demons, collect them, and summon them in battles. Demons are divided
            into various races and species. Otherwise, the game uses a standard turn-based combat with physical attacks
            and magic spells.

            The game is a part of Megaten universe, but unlike most other Megaten games (with the exception of Last
            Bible series), it is set in a medieval world.</story>

            king. His minions stormed the castle and burnt it down. The king could not escape his fate, and the villain

            Present time. You are Ariel, a little girl who lives with her old wise grandmother in a small house near a
            mountain range, north to the forest. She just turned ten, and the grandmother sends her on a seemingly

            what starts as a simple assignment soon develops into the quest for magic powers of Aretha, the ultimate
            battle against the evil, and the discovery of Ariel's own true identity.

            The game is a console-style RPG, where Ariel and her party travel on the world map, through forests,
            mountain paths, and caves, occasionally visiting towns and fighting monsters in turn-based combat viewed

        <story>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it's later
            counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode and level codes
            were added only for the GameBoy Color version.

            To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over
            Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up
            Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing
            the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the
            Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most
            levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be
            adjusted.

            There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely:
            Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of
            each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot
            of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in
            Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull -
            victory will get you the desired trophy!</story>

        <story>Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its
            namesake. Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge,
            then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.

            You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation. Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of
            space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris. The game consists of five zones, each with
            a different background and some with special features. Each zone has 15 levels. In addition to the standard
            asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well,
            indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly
            baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back! And there's plenty of enemies in addition to
            the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and
            Vulturoids.

            There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are also
            three skill levels. If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship. All
            ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.
            There are also limited power-ups you can pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and
            Trigger Bombs.

            The game supports either one or two players. In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your
            opponent in a random zone and level. You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are
            other ways....

            Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of
            "Classic Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.</story>

        <story>Astro Rabby is a top-down platformer in which the player takes control over a rabbit which has to travel
            through a number of levels with forced scrolling. Unfortunately there are only so much usable platforms
            available, in the space levels even less, which have to hit by performing controlled jumps. The platforms
            come in three heights which are indicated by their size - the bigger, the higher. Landing on a platform
            creates a lot of force and either causes the block to crack and, if it has a question mark on it, gives a
            power up (extra time or points).

            The levels loop until the player finds a heart hidden in the question mark blocks - but landing on a cracked
            platform causes it to give way. Of course there are also enemies which have to be avoided or shot with the
            gun. Those leave behind power ups which give additional ammo or improve the jumping height respectively
            speed.</story>

        <story>Atomic Punk, which was released as Dynablaster in Europe and Bomber Boy in Japan, is a game from Hudson
            Soft's Bomberman series.

            The game offers two single player and two multiplayer modes. The single player mode called "Game B" has the
            classical Bomberman gameplay, while the mode "Game A" introduces several variations. The levels in Game A
            are divided in nine areas, which can be accessed in any order from a world map. Depending on the time taken
            to finish a level and the number of blocks destroyed, the player gets a certain amount of gold, which can be
            used to buy power-ups (called "panels" in the game) in shop, which in term is accessed from the map.
            Power-ups allow, for example, to revive Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase the length of an
            explosion. Before entering a new area, the player chooses which panels to use in order to complete the area.

            The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player modes. In "Panel mode", each player can place only one bomb
            at a time and the bombs' radius starts at one, but panels appear in the field to improve this. In "Powerful
            mode", no panels appear, but each player can place up to four bombs at a time and the radius is four.

            baseball titles. But you'll have to do this in a single sitting as no battery save option was included.

            Play in USA or Japan mode for a subtle change in the gameplay or learn how to best utilize the strengths of
            the East and West teams. Pitchers are rated 1 to 5 and batters get a rating for both running speed and

            intense video game adventure. The Dark Knight and his partner Robin fight Gotham City's most infamous fiends
            in five original episodes of sizzling crime fighting action. Batman's strategic use of the grappling hook is
            crucial for surviving the onslaught of evil enemies. And Robin relies on his hang-from-the-ceiling skills to
            escape certain doom. Both of our heroes possess fists of amazing strength and must try to find weapon
            power-ups scattered throughout the mayhem.

            Episode 1 - "The Joke's On You". That sinister villain planted a gift box containing a very unfunny surprise
            for the people of Gotham City. Crush The Joker's robot clowns and wipe that permanent smile off his face.
            Episode 2 - "The Chill of a Lifetime". Mr. Freeze has put the entire city on ice and you're next. His
            helper, a homicidal hayseed known as the Scarecrow also awaits you.
            Episode 3 - "The Green Menace". Poison Ivy's monster plant growth is turning Gotham City into a genuine
            concrete jungle. But before you yank her by the roots you'll have Catwoman and Red Claw to tangle with.
            Episode 4 - "Bank Robbing is a Gas". The Riddler and The Penguin have been knocking over banks by knocking
            out the people with sleeping gas. An army of robot dolls and penguins will try to keep you from getting in
            the way.
            Episode 5 - "The Joker's Last Laugh?" The Joker's back for revenge in Gotham City's Port Authority Building.
            It's the ultimate challenge that could put the Dark Knight's lights out forever.</story>

        <story>Batman Forever is the officially licensed game based on the 1995 movie. The bad guys this time around are
            the Riddler and Two-Face.

            This game is a hybrid of side-scrolling platformer and one-on-one fighter. The player makes way through
            levels that include some platform jumping elements, but take on opponents one at a time like in a fighting
            game. The player's arsenal includes a lot of nifty bat-gadgets (one has to be chosen before the level
            starts) and a collection of fighting moves that are unleashed with special button combinations. In contrast
            to the console/DOS version, there are no puzzles to solve.</story>

        <story>In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious
            tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360
            degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3D movement, Toshinden's
            game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves.

            Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS
            PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably
            different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls.

            The U.S and E.U PlayStation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using
            different instruments.

            The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in
            the process, likely due to their suggestive nature.

            Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same
            reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice
            actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.

            The later DOS version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese PlayStation version in all
            regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on PlayStation.</story>

        <story>Battle Bull is an action game in which the player takes the role of an excavator driver who participates
            in a championship with 48 levels. The goal is simple: driving through the levels and killing a certain
            amount of other (respawning) drivers. The usual way of achieving this is shoving stones into them. However,
            only a certain kind of stone can be used this way; the other ones are permanent. The other vehicles have the
            same ability in addition to the deadly touch.

            After each round, the player receives money which can be reinvested inside the upgrade shop. The available
            items are better engines, better shovels, extra lives, the ability to jump and weapons. The latter are
            obviously an alternate way of reaching the kill ratio.</story>

        <story>Gundam, Kamen Rider V3 and Ultraman Taro are the main representatives of the 'heroes' side of the six
            teams in Battle Dodge Ball, with Zeong, Ikadevil and Zetton rounding out as the villains.

            The general gist of the game is that you can choose one of the six teams. You then fight each of the other
            five teams once per round in a short dodgeball game, two-on-two. Unlike normal dodgeball, you are not
            knocked out with a single hit. Rather, in Battle Dodge Ball, each character has a specific amount of HP.
            Once he takes enough hits to lose all his HP, he is out of the match.

            Along with HP, this trends into a general statistics system with several other stats. If you win a match,
            you gain a variable amount of experience points, and 15 experience points if you lose a match. You can level
            up your stats and make each match significantly easier over time.

            Your team has two players each. The Leader has the ability to make special attacks, and is generally more
            powerful. The follower, however, has two 'forms' or copies or whatever - an infielder who plays on the main
            arena, and an outfielder who stands on the lines behind the enemy side of the arena and can catch long
            passes and grab balls that enemies dodge. The outfielder can also return balls to you, but also throw it at
            the enemy players, making him potentially dangerous. Stats for the outfielder are upgraded separately from
            his infield counterpart.

            Once you play a full 10 rounds against each of the five opposing teams, the game ends.</story>

        <story>Battle of Kingdom is a Japan-exclusive strategy/board game.
            The object is to lead a kingdom through various battles using the format of a traditional board game.
            In order to advance to the next battle, players must destroy at least 92% of the monsters on the
            battlefield.
            Each stage represents a battle in a high fantasy campaign to save the world from an unknown evil force (that
            resides in a skull castle). As players progresses to the right side of the screen killing monsters from the
            enemy forces, the probability of winning the entire battle shows up in percentage. Players are unable to
            automatically attack the opponent if the number of points on the attack power meter becomes depleted.
            Attacking manually does not deduct attack points from the player's statistics, however.
            Monsters like slimes can face off against each other for control of the playing field in the lower levels of
            the game,
            while players are allowed in the upper levels of the game to summon the King's loyal army of archers,
            knights, horsemen and magicians. Even the leader of each respective kingdom is expected to fight. All these
            creatures must be bought in card form before being allowed to join the battlefield. The player's creatures
            can either fight, run away from battle, or cast a magic spell. All creatures have hit points, attack points,
            and special points.</story>

            the journey.

            Just like in Zelda II, there is a top-down map of Greece with towns and other locations to explore. Each of
            these has side-scrolling sections in which Orpheus fights his way through the minions of Hades. There are
            various items one must get to continue to the next location, including swords, shields and crystals. There
            are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight
            Hades to save his beloved Helene.

            The monsters of the game are also based on the Greek mythology and it is pretty entertaining to confront
            cyclopes, minotaurs and pegasuses.</story>

        <story>Sailor Moon was a video game released for the Nintendo Game Boy by Angel Studios in 1992. It was one of
            the first Sailor Moon-related video games to be released.

            In this game, the player controlled Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon. The storyline was based on the first, third,
            and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those
            episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).

            The three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health
            spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and
            entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.

            By default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the "down" button would make Sailor Moon
            sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks
            explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action
            for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc.
            The bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each
            time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing
            Queen Beryl.</story>

        <story>Sailor Moon R was a video game released for the Nintendo Game Boy by Angel Studios in 1994.

            In this game, the player could play using "story mode" or "arcade mode." In story mode, the player began
            play with Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon, then Chibiusa, then the Inner Senshi. Gameplay alternated between a
            story chapter where the player walked around the map and talked to other characters, followed by a platform
            level, and a boss room. In arcade mode, the player chose a character, and the non-combat parts of the game
            are skipped.

            In both modes, the game was complete after five stages, most of which were rather short. The boss rooms
            sometimes started with a scene with Tuxedo Mask where the player would receive an extra life for picking up
            the rose item. Other items the player could pick up included hearts, which refilled some health, cake
            slices, which refilled more health, and a tiara, which offered a power-up to the character's attacks.

        <story>Blodia is a puzzle game with similarities to sliding block puzzles. Each level is composed of a number of
            tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or angular) on it - except one which is just a black
            hole. In one tile a red ball starts rolling and all tiles it rolls through become blank.

            The goal of each level is to let the ball roll through all pipe parts without meeting the hole or a blank
            tile.
            To ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player
            clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole
            are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start
            of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are
            cleared the ball comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.

            The game features all levels of the TurboGrafx-16 version plus additional ones.</story>

            based on the same concept. In Anagram, players must unscramble a short sequence of letters to form a
            meaningful word. In Categories, a 6x6 grid is filled with pre-determined letters and players must find a
            number of words matching a category like 'musical instruments', 'sports' or 'beauty products'. Use All takes
            place on a 5x5 grid, with the major challenge being that letters used to form a word are removed from the
            grid. The goal is to clear the entire grid. The letters can be rescrambled if necessary.

            The game can be played by one or two human players who can be joined by up to four CPU players of varying AI

        <story>Gameplay in Booby Boys is very simple. The goal of the level is to collect all of the sparkling chests.
            In doing so, a key will appear, which you can bring to a door in the level to go to the next one. There are
            ten levels in each world, and you freely choose to do each world in any order you want.

            The main impediment to this process -- other than the clock, which kills you if time runs out -- are the
            enemies. You can press the B Button to dig a hole and trap enemies within when they walk in. (Holes can also
            kill you on higher difficulties.) If you want to close a hole, press B while facing it; if an enemy is
            within, they'll die and you'll gain points. (They will be replaced with a tombstone, which cannot have a
            hole dug on it anymore.) You'll also possibly gain some items.</story>

        <story>Brain Drain is a puzzle game in which the player has to recreate a pattern, consisting of different
            symbols like apples or hearts, which is shown in the corner of the screen. The main playing field consists
            of said symbols, but randomly switched around. The player controls a frame which encloses four of the
            symbols. When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the frame. Of course the levels
            have to be solved within a time limit.

            In the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called special effects which
            occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get hidden by "?" blocks, symbols rotate on their own or
            the controls are reversed. Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level
            really fast: clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level) and credit (gives a second
            try after time has run out). Clock and flash have to be activated manually; credits is applied
            automatically. Besides the regular playing mode, there is also the "Brain Race" available which involves
            solving a certain number of levels (depending on the difficulty) as fast as possible.</story>

            jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to
            blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble
            must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float
            by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the
            player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon

        <story>BurgerTime Deluxe is a new version of the classic arcade game from 1982, developed for the casual market.
            As in the original, the player controls a cooking chef that must climb stairs to reach platforms and walk
            over food pieces, to make them fall and create a complete hamburgers on plates at the bottom of the screen.
            The cook must avoid touching the roaming enemies, anthropomorphic condiments and fried eggs that kill the
            main character. The foes can be destroyed with power-ups, or squashed by the falling burger pieces.

            There are power-ups and bonus items scattered throughout the levels. The ketchup bottle kills all the
            enemies on the level, the salt shaker stops their movement for a few seconds, the ice cube makes the chef
            invulnerable for a few moments and freezes the adversaries, the burning cocktail also makes the cook
            invulnerable for a short time and burns the approaching foes, the bubble lifts the character directly to an
            upper level and the energy drink makes the chef temporally faster. Potato chips, ice-cream cones, cups of
            coffee and tea give bonus points, while French fries give extra lives. A Bonus mini-game appears between
            levels after collecting the letters that form the name of an ingredient, where the player has to find pairs
            of food items by uncovering several cooking pots, guide the chef through a maze and complete other similar
            challenges.

            There are two modes in the computer version: in Story Mode, a plot is developed through cutscenes between
            levels, where two chefs called Peter Pepper and Sally Salt must help their uncle to save the family's burger
            diner from Vinny Vinegar, the owner of a competing hot dog franchise. Quick Mode is closer to the arcade
            original, where the levels are randomly generated and the game ends when all the lives are spent. The iPhone
            version has only the Story Mode, with 60 levels and a smaller view area.</story>

            Your goal, is to cut out parts of the wall with your beam, causing them to fall on the enemies below. You
            should be careful not to cut out too big of a piece; otherwise you'll find yourself not having any usable
            pieces of the wall later on in the level. It can be very easy to do so without noticing.

            If an enemy reaches the top of the building, touching it will cause you to lose a turn. It'll either start

        <story>Bust-A-Move 3 DX is the same game as Bust-A-Move '99. Besides the obvious differences because of
            technical limitations of the platform, e.g. the bubbles have to differentiated from of their shades instead
            of colour, it also has less playing modes. Only the arcade mode (a port of the original arcade version with
            the main singleplayer campaign or the possibility to challenge an AI opponent) and the challenge mode
            (beating a series of 25 levels as fast as possible) are available.

            Regarding gameplay, this is a tile matching game. There are bubbles of varying shades at the top of the
            screen and the player controls a stationary cannon at the bottom of the screen. The cannon is loaded with
            one bubble at the time and the direction of the shot can be varied left and right. The goal is to clear the
            screen by matching bubbles of the same colour.</story>

        <story>Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on
            the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game.

            Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot
            hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split
            on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also
            have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons.
            There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb
            ladders, but cannot jump.

            You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the
            ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy
            barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small
            period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and
            such.</story>

            which four Marvel Comics licensed heroes (Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye and Vision) take on the evil
            Red Skull, who, by assembling a team of super-villains, seeks to conquer the world.

            The game consists of five stages, primarily focusing on side-scrolling brawler gameplay, but some of the
            levels also feature side-scrolling shooting stages, where the heroes battle menaces in the air (Stage 2),
            under the sea (Stage 3), and in space (Stage 5). Boss villains in the game consist of Living Laser and Klaw,
            Whirlwind, Grim Reaper, Wizard, Mandarin, Juggernaut, Ultron, Controller, Crossbones, and the Red Skull. In
            addition to the four playable Avengers, Quicksilver makes brief appearances to drop energy replenishments,
            and the Wasp can add protection and firepower in the shooting areas.</story>

        <story>Castle Quest is board strategy game mixed with magic battle confrontations. The game is like a chess
            clone with fantasy creatures that fight with playing cards. The player's goal is to topple the opponents
            king. A player controls a small army (with units like orcman, karate man, warrior etc) on a small chess
            board. If two pieces meet on the same square, they fight on special screen with a playing-card roulette.
            Depending on the cards that each unit gets they will do damage to an opponent. Different units have
            different health points and also different cards, for example, some units have more propensity to getting
            the instantly killing joker card.

            Some units are able to cast attack or defense spells. When these pieces move to an empty square on the map a
            spell window will open. Each spell can either damage surrounding squares or heal/revive surrounding units.

            Transylvania. None dared challenge him, and the people of the country lived in fear and terror - until a
            young girl rose up and decided to take matters into her own hands. That young girl was Sonia Belmont, the
            first in the line of the legendary Belmont clan.

            While Castlevania Legends plays similar to the earlier Castlevania titles (the protagonist is only armed
            with a whip and needs to fight her way through five stages plus a hidden stage), there are also some unique
            features. While it is impossible to roam the stages freely, quite often the player can choose to go one way
            or another and in doing so skip some areas or find valuable items, collecting all of which will unlock the
            best ending. Sonia also possesses special power called Burning mode: once in a level (and once per life) she
            can boost her speed and attack power and become invincible for a short period of time.

            Each of the game's bosses leaves behind an orb with a Soul weapon inside. Sonia can collect five of these
            weapons: Wind, Ice, Flame, Saint and Magic. Similar to previous games these are activated by pressing
            up+attack, and require a certain number of hearts. The player can switch to any Soul Power at any moment at
            a weapon select screen. Sonia's whip can be upgraded three times, the third upgrade adding a fireball-like
            projectile.</story>

            100 mazes in this labyrinth, it will be quite a challenge to get out of the curse's reach!

            Catrap is more than just a game of mindbending intrigue and action. Be the architect of the underground
            labyrinth and make your own games of intricate puzzles.

            Whether you choose to be a maze builder or a maze solver, we know you can help Catboy and Catgirl land on
            their feet.

            Catrap (known as Pitman in Japan) is a puzzle game in which the player maneuvers the player, an
            anthropomorphic cat, to navigate a room while clearing obstacles and kicking monsters and ghosts off the
            screen. Once the player has knocked all of the enemies off the screen, he advances to the next level.
            Advancement can prove difficult for the player as increasingly intricate obstacles are presented to overcome
            all of the monsters and ghosts. Arguably, the easiest route to solve the problem is through trial and error.
            A player may try one combination of maneuvers by moving the obstacle in one direction, then he may find
            himself trapped. The player can hit the 'A'-button to reverse his movements and try again in a different way
            until he finds the solution that enables him to access all of the baddies to knock them off the screen.
            Trial and error seems to make up a large portion of the game. Players can also create their own mazes. The
            game is credited with having originated the time-rewind mechanic.</story>

        <story>Championship Pool is a pool game where players can 8-ball or 9-ball pool tournament that starts off with
            the BCA Regional Championship where the player must defeat 32 opponents in a first to four games match. If
            the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner
            of that then goes onto the World Championship.

            All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location
            they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit
            is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small
            margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the
            ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and
            spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes.

            There are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different
            game modes and there games are:

            1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball
            or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never
            actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the
            player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way
            the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.

            2. Challenge: It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The
            games are:
            14.1 Challenge ? After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At
            that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over. If
            there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end
            score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5
            games to get the total score.

            must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

            Equal Offence ? Same as 14.1 Challenge but there is only one game played.

            Three Pool ? Only have 3 balls on the table. Score is based on how many shots it takes to get all three
            balls in with lower been better.

            Speed Pool ? Objective is to hit all the balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is timing how long the
            game takes. Any ball can be hit at any time and the player can miss the shot and not be penalised (other
            than taking longer).3. Party: It has many different multiplayer pool games that are played with ether just 2

            Ten Ball (2-8 Players) ? Same as Nine Ball except with 10 balls.

            Rotation (2-8 Players) ? Only the lowest ball can be hit and the score for getting a ball in is the value of
            the ball (e.g. 8-ball is 8 points). Player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

            Straight Pool (2 Players) ? Same as 14.1 Continuous but the player with the highest score after one game
            wins.

            each others score.

            Fifteen Ball (2-8 Players) ? Same as Rotation except that any ball can be hit not just the lowest.

            buildings or you waste time getting on the road again.

            However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with
            turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based

            ones, not the "build the picture" type), learn chess by browsing through the hundreds of tutorials available
            in the Pandolfini's Chess School or watch famous games.

            There are, however, some new features in the PS2 version; the most useful one is the Online mode. Other is
            the "living world" of the Chessmaster Championships, where the AI's rating changes, too, as they play each
            other. The last one is more spectacular - a fantasy-themed - orcs vs. humans - game mode with animated chess

            from a sly and sinister enemy in order to avert total chaos. Only your skill can save us now.

            You command the AH 90 Commanche attack helicopter, the ultimate fighting machine. Your arsenal includes:
            machine guns, flame throwers, missiles and invisibility. Superior technology must be used wisely against the
            omnipresent enemy. Antagonists attack with everything they've got: bullets, missiles, tanks, subterranean
            gun turrets and land mines. Hectic heli-heroics are required to save the hostages and yourself.

            ChopLifter II features five stages, each with it's own threatening terrain. The game can be played by one or

            through enemy territory to rescue hostages. The helicopter does not only take damage from enemy fire, but
            also from contact with buildings, trees, walls etc., which makes some levels difficult to navigate.

            Enemies can be destroyed by either using the helicopter's standard weapon, or more powerful weapons that can
            be picked up throughout the levels. The main task of each level however, is picking up a certain number of

            Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The

            fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character
            is noticeably less accurate.

            The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated

            planet, as they attempt to free the lovely-and imprisoned-Princess Blobette from the clutches of the
            treacherous Antagonistic Alchemist.

            Join our heroes as they encounter secret rooms, clever traps, and dangerous obstacles in the labyrinthine
            depths of the castle. But all is not lost-these two share a very special secret: With each flavor of jelly
            bean the boy feeds Blob, Blob will magically transform into a different shape that can help this intrepid
            pair get past just about anything the Alchemist can conjure up!

            The Rescue of Princess Blobette tells the story of a young, male protagonist and his blob companion as they
            attempt to rescue the latter's girlfriend, the titular Princess Blobette. The damsel in distress has been

            who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle
            to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he
            falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents.
            However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each
            flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change
            him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra
            jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra
            lives by one.</story>

        <story>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with
            this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR
            racing rather than a direct recreation of the film.

            You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that
            of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The
            races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied. This means that
            the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated
            alongside the races themselves.

            From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members
            of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you lose positions at the race. The other racers, however,
            never pit.

            The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</story>

            Dennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr. Wilson?s house, each of which

            avoided. The enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from bottom-left to
            top-right anyway.

            Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are given up
            to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth

        <story>Dexterity is a puzzle game with a 7x8 grid, each one filled with a tile or another item. The goal is to
            flip over all tiles within a time limit. This has to be triggered manually by pressing a button, but if
            there is another flipped tile on the field, all other tiles between the player's position and the other tile
            will flip, too. Some grids are filled with stationary blocks, moveable blocks (either pushing them normally
            or send them flying with a strong kick) and holes.

            There are also monsters which need to be avoided. All five of them have different behaviour patterns and
            have the ability to reverse already flipped tiles; some of them can even push blocks or destroy tiles. The
            monsters can be killed by using blocks against them: pushing them over the borders of the playfield or a
            hole will kill them. Alternatively they also can be trapped. Killed monsters slowly respawn at pre-defined
            spawn points; this takes place over several phases. In the "egg" phase, it can be picked up to kill another
            enemy with it. Another possible weapon are stunned enemies which stood on a multi-flipped row.

            When pushing blocks into a corner, they will disappear and transform into power ups, e.g. bonus points,
            extra time or a temporary stun of all enemies. A life is lost when an enemy is touched or the time runs out.
            When that happens, all flipped tiles stay flipped.</story>

            spit eggs, and Squitter the Spider can shoot webbing as well as use it to create new platforms.

            Each level has Bonus Coins and DK Coins tucked well away in the levels. While it's possible to gain an
            ending without these, to complete the game properly, players must seek them all out and unlock levels of the

        <story>Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is
            similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead
            maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must
            approach the monster and "bump" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its
            blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the
            knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is
            randomized.



            The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's
            strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points,
            which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic
            spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating
            a map of the area.</story>

            Duck Tales 2 is the sequel to the NES and Game Boy game, Duck Tales. Based on the Disney cartoon of the same

            discover hidden pieces of the map.

            Scrooge's main method of attack is his cane - by jumping in the air and holding the B Button, the cane turns
            into a pogo stick, allowing players to jump onto most enemies' heads and cross dangerous terrain like spikes

            sending the object flying or occasionally revealing secret items. New to Duck Tales 2 is the ability to push
            and pull certain objects with the cane after hitting them.

            Familiar faces such as Huey, Dewey and Louie, Webby, Mrs. Beakley, and Launchpad McQuack all turn up to lend
            a hand. Scrooge will even bump into the crazy inventor, Gyro Gearloose, who will improve Scrooge's cane so

        <story>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security
            building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.

            Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent
            17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:
            Shooting them with his gun.
            Kicking them by jumping onto them.
            Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.
            Crushing them with an elevator.
            Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy
            spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.

            While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still
            get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an
            elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to
            leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to
            make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to
            fall.

            Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel.
            There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have
            time to jump.

            Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his
            car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining
            documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.

            If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble
            controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm
            doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys
            may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys
            when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</story>

            Battle, World Grand Prix, and Test Run.

            Battle mode allows for an exhibition race where the player can choose any course and its condition plus how
            many laps the race will be. The player can also choose to race up to 13 other opposing racers,

            World Grand Prix mode lets the player compete in a season of F1 races. The higher a position a racer
            finishes in a race, the more points will be awarded to increase their place in the total season standings.

            Test Run lets the player practice any track without the interference of other racers,

            Players can fine-tune their car using a variety of settings. Settings include adjusting the steering, tires,
            gears, brakes, wings, and the suspension. Players can also choose the type of pit work, tachometer (digital
            or analog), and whether to have either manual or automatic gear shifting.</story>

            There are two modes of play. First there is a single player mode in which your goal is to find the exit to
            each level. There are 70 mazes in this mode. The second mode is the multiplayer arena. For the Game Boy: up
            to 4 Game Boys can be linked together in this mode.</story>

        <story>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character.

            The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally,
            Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty.

            There are four different types of levels.


            Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and
            chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

            Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

            Levels that take place entirely under water.

            Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or
            an umbrella.


            Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain
            number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types
            of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging
            from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard
            weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting
            hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard
            weapon, he loses a life.

            The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</story>

        <story>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first
            installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint,
            previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation,
            one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another
            thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

            Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of
            10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard
            set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates
            continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering
            shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the
            ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5
            different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team
            Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</story>

            gameplay and graphics.

            The major changes are in the character classes and party members. Similar to FFL, starting a game of Legends
            II allows you to choose your main character from Humans, Monsters, Mutants and a new class: Robots. From
            here, you build your party of 4 from the same character classes. During gameplay special side-characters
            will join you in battle to help defeat certain enemies.

            The other improvement is in strategy. In FFL you gain experience points after each battle, increasing
            strength, etc. In FFLII, you gain different points and abilities depending on how you defeated the enemy. If
            you win by using a sword, your strength increases. If you use magic, your mana increases. This adds a more
            strategic approach to defeating enemies.</story>

            The inclusion of a time travel storyline means that whatever you do in one time frame can have an affect on
            what happens in another time. Other major changes compared to the original 2 in the series are the ability
            to mutate your characters further and a change to the upgrade system.
            Items picked up after battle can be attached to your mutants or humans to turn them into monsters or robots,
            increasing your parties power and abilities.
            And although the original system of obtaning experience points after every battle has been removed, its
            replacement allows you to choose which magic stone each character can use, so they learn that specific magic

        <story>Frisky Tom is a 1981 arcade game by Nichibutsu. The object of the game is to provide enough water for a
            shower by crawling along a network of plumbing pipes and picking up/replacing loose pieces. Various types of
            mice are the game's antagonists, trying to thwart Tom in different ways: knocking pipes loose to disrupt the
            water flow, jumping down to fall on him, or setting a bomb to blow up the entire plumbing arrangement. A
            version for the Atari 5200 was programmed in 1983, but was never published.[1] It was, however, released for
            the Nintendo Game Boy in 1995 and the PlayStation in 2002. A Bandai Electronics VFD hand held version of
            Frisky Tom was released in 1982.[2]

            Mouskattack, another game featuring both mice and a pipe-laying theme, was published in 1982 by Sierra
            On-Line for the Atari 8-bit family and Apple II.</story>

            original 1980's handheld games, featuring the popular "Mr. Game &amp; Watch" himself, as well as Mario and
            friends.

            The compilation consists of four popular titles from the Game &amp; Watch Series, each with a "Classic" and
            "Modern" version of each game:

            1. Octopus: Collects as much treasure as your bag can hold, while avoiding the octopus tentacles that
            continually swing around you. In the "Modern" version, Mario becomes the diver, and as he collects more
            treasure, his bag becomes heavier, making it harder to return to the surface. Mario can also delay the
            octopus tentacles by throwing treasure at them.

            Fire: Position your net to catch the falling people jumping from the burning building. The "Modern" version
            has Mario and Luigi rescuing Toad, Yoshi and Donkey Kong Jr. from Princess Peach's Castle. Each falling
            character has different weights and falling patterns.

            Manhole: The player must cover the holes to keep the continually walking people from falling through the
            manholes and into the sewers. In the "Modern" version, Yoshi must use his tongue to keep Mario, Toad and
            Donkey Kong Jr. from falling thought the hole, each character having different speeds and patterns.

            Oil Panic: The player must collect the dripping blobs of oil before they slip past and ruin everything. The
            "Modern" version has Bowser dropping oil blobs at Mario, who has to catch the oil and dump it over to Yoshi
            before the Koopa King gets the best of Mario.

            Each mode (Classic and Modern) has two difficulties: Easy and Hard. The higher score a player gets in each
            version, new unlockable bonuses will become available via the "Gallery Corner". These bonuses include
            release dates, pictures and animations which tell in greater detail the history behind Gunpei Yokoi's
            portable creations.</story>

            versus the White Moon army in turn-based battles over 16 maps, which, unlike in the previous game, are
            arranged in hexagonal grids.

            On each map, the goal is to either destroy all enemy forces or capture the enemy's capital city. 24
            different troop types are available, which can be given various orders from attacking enemy units to
            supporting friendly ones to besieging or capturing enemy cities or installations. Battles are shown as small
            animated sequences.

            Building (and repairing) units requires income, which is generated by occupying cities or production
            facilities. What units can be constructed where depends on the building type: factories and cities build
            land units, airports and harbors are required for air and sea units, respectively.

            The game offers a battery-based save game feature even in the midst of playing a map, as well as a
            two-player feature, with two players sharing a Game Boy and taking turns.</story>

            screen, and a grid of pegs (which become less complete on later levels). Your task on each level is to use a
            number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the cogs are linked together. All this has to
            be completed before the engine overheats.

            Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name "Poffins". One of these goes around removing
            pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears
            placed over them to stop them.

            There's also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather

        <story>The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman's KO Boxing are fairly identical to the other
            versions in concept, but there are a few notable changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title
            James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same name, which
            is entirely different.

            Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing matches
            against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions
            have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid
            punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and
            crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is
            based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be
            pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay
            can be selected.

            Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when
            near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep
            punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match
            the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are
            supported.</story>

            city. He captures Diana's baby and it is up to the Ghostbusters to get him back. In order to accomplish
            this, the Ghostbusters: Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston, must chase Virgo through the courtrooms, the sewers,
            the apartments, the underground and the art museum.

            Ghostbusters II is a top-view action game based off of New Ghostbusters II (the second Ghostbusters II
            license on NES) but with enough differences to be unique. Players begin by choosing two of the four
            ghostbusters, who all play the exact same. The first one selected is controlled by the player directly and
            carries a proton pack, the second ghostbuster is follows the first and carries the ghost trap. The objective
            of each level is to capture a predefined number of ghosts before the timer expires. The player moves up,
            down, left and right. One button will fire the proton gun directly in front of the first ghostbuster,
            stunning any ghosts. The second button will toss the trap directly in front of the second ghostbuster,
            trapping any stunned ghosts. While exploring the levels, any of the 2 remaining ghostbusters (as well as the
            ghostbusters' accountant Louis) not currently being used will occasionally show up. Touching them will
            provide power-ups (and often swap with a selected Ghostbuster) including vacuum guns, instant traps and
            invulnerability.</story>

            Array: In this game, the player has a 8x8 grid and is presented with six tiles. Always the lowest of those
            tiles has to placed into one of the grids. A correct tile combination causes them to disappear and every
            disappeared tile counts down the score of 500. The goal is to reach zero before the board is full.

        <story>God Medicine: Fantasy Sekai no Tanjou is a role-playing video game for the Game Boy. The game was
            released by Konami in 1993, only in Japan. The game was re-released in 1998 through the Nintendo Power
            service, adding Super Game Boy support and featuring a bestiary for encountered monsters; this version was
            called God Medicine Hukkokuban.

            A video gaming company was to release Phantom, their new RPG, but the company mysteriously is destroyed.
            Noah, Ken, and Miki are three RPG fans that are disappointed by this. Wandering about, they stumble upon a
            shack with a great demon inside, battling three warriors. The warriors are defeated and the demon exits
            through a portal. The warriors give their souls and powers to the three RPG fans, who now must enter Phantom
            to save the game's world. However, they must also protect the real world from the demon.

            God Medicine features standard RPG elements. The three characters can level up through battle and equip
            weapons and armor. Spells can be learned, as well as Maphu attacks. After the party collects Maphu gems and
            gains the special Maphu weapons, they can put the gems in the weapons. Each gem has a different effect
            depending on what character equips it. Some Maphu attacks need to be charged during battle first. The
            charges last even if the battle is finished. The player can save anytime, except in battle.</story>

        <story>This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a
            fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from
            the traditional Toho lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has
            two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in
            giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode
            before the player has completed the Normal mode.

            The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching
            the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from
            which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's
            performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player
            has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will
            be available.

            The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing
            different moves. Naturally, the normal "punch-kick" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and
            biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing
            monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold
            the opponent and suck its blood.</story>

            from slowing down enemies to turning the Metalion into an invincible drill-like machine for a brief amount

        <story>As Great Greed begins, you are accidentally warped to another dimension by a wizard by the name of
            'Microwave'?. With no immediate way back, you help the people fight off the scourge named 'Bio-Haz' who is
            consuming this dimension with evil and destruction.

            This new dimension you find yourself in is not terribly unlike the one you came from, with the exception
            that everyone is named after foods or food-related items and most of the monsters appear to be mutated
            vegetables and the like.

            This RPG breaks from the normal formula in a few respects. The battle system does not use any menus,
            switching all commands to simple button pushes. A being attack, B for dodge, Start will run and the D-Pad is
            shortcuts to certain spells. The combat is also live, in the sense that if you take too long to complete
            your turn, your opponent will attack again.

            Using a battery-backed save system, the game will automatically auto-save after every successful battle.

            year, while taking care of your budget and yourself.

            You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may
            have. You can trade with many of the town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend's Game Boy,
            you can trade items between players as well.

            The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the
            time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.

            From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite
            tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons
            (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm
            during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.

            The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards
            compatible with the original Game Boy version.</story>

            "super shot" which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck.

            Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take
            on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a
            "shot race" mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</story>

            320 points are awarded for tiles completely surrounded on all six sides by other tiles. Any tiles that
            aren't "standing" on at least one other tile will fall off the board causing a premature game over: players

        <story>In this platformer based on the 1991 comedy/action film of the same name, the player takes on the role of
            Eddie Hawkins, known as "Hudson Hawk," the world's greatest cat burglar. After ten years in prison for a
            robbery of a government installation gone wrong, Eddie is released, intending to go straight and retire.
            Unfortunately, fate has other plans.

            Years ago, Leonardo Da Vinci created a machine with the intention of converting common lead into bronze for
            use on his commissioned sculpture of a horse. Da Vinci got the shock of his life when he found out the
            machine didn't convert lead to bronze... it converted it to gold. Knowing the ramifications of what the
            machine could do, Da Vinci broke the crystal that powered it into three pieces and hid them in three of his
            works: a miniature sculpture of a horse called the Sforza, his sketchbook and notebook called the Codex, and
            a miniature model of his helicopter design, hoping that they would never again see the light of day.

            Unfortunately, ultra-rich psychotic yuppies Darwin and Minerva Mayflower have found out about the machine
            and own one piece of the crystal. Planning to flood the market with gold and crush the global economy, they
            need the remaining crystal pieces and require Eddie's services. To force him to comply, they kidnap his best
            friend and partner Tommy "Five-Tone" Messina and threaten to have him killed unless Eddie fetches them. With
            no choice, Eddie will have to do the jobs, save his friend, and put an end to the Mayflowers' plot.

            From Rutherford's Auction House in New York, to the Vatican, and finally Castle Da Vinci in Italy, Eddie
            will have to dodge an odd assortment of enemies, from security guards and guard dogs, to janitors, crazed
            nuns, balloon-riding henchmen, paparazzi, and kids on bikes. Hawk's sole tool of the trade, aside from a
            wicked punch, is a baseball, of which he has an infinite supply. He'll use this to subdue enemies, distract
            guard dogs, and trigger switches. Eddie can also crawl to avoid shots and the occasional security beam.
            There's also ropes and pipes to shimmy across to avoid traps, and boxes to push and stack to reach those out
            of reach areas.</story>

        <story>Hugo 2 is a game based on a call-in TV series for kids. It includes five levels which are directly based
            on mini games from the TV show. The goal is always to both survive and collect as many money bags as
            possible. The amount of required bags to beat a level depends on the chosen difficulty level.
            Underwater snorkeling: Hugo camera is fixed behind Hugo's back and he has to dodge incoming obstacles. He
            also needs to regularly take new breath which is only possible if he stays in the middle of the screen.
            Snowboarding: Just like in the underwater level, Hugo has to dodge incoming obstacles; just on a snowboard.
            Forest: Hugo automatically moves from left to right and has to dodge obstacles by either jumping or ducking.
            Ice cave: Here Hugo moves over a bottomless pit. The only way to stay alive is to stand on pillars, but
            those randomly rise and fall. Hugo can move in four directions.
            The fifth level is unlocked after beating the other four.
            The Game Boy Color version additionally has a training mode which allows to play the levels individually.

        <story>Based on the movie of the same name, the Soviet Union have been building in secret a Typhoon-class
            submarine with nuclear strike capabilities. This war machine has been named the Red October. While on its
            trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to
            the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders
            are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October.

            You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The
            Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards
            the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive
            (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that
            will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and
            Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or
            decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</story>

        <story>kari no Yōsai 2 is set after the happenings of Fortified Zone. The two special agents Masato Kanzaki and
            Mizuki Makimura receive a new important mission: destroying the ultimate weapon the enemy is developing in
            its secret base.

            This is a top-down action game in which the player needs to find a way through a maze-like environment while
            shooting enemies. Sometimes there is also a key to find in order to open a closed door. Of course enemy
            contact should be avoided because it drains the life energy. The most important feature of the game are the
            two mercenaries which have different abilities (Masato is slow and has high stamina, Mizuki the opposite)
            and can be switched instantly.

            While the basic gameplay concept is unchanged from the predecessor, there are two major differences: the
            characters can be moved diagonally and, besides health pick-ups, there are no power-ups anymore. The special
            weapons for each character can be switched in an extra menu, the weapons have unlimited ammo and the effects
            of the other power-ups (increasing attack range, attack power, etc.) have been incorporated into the
            protagonist's differences.</story>

        <story>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade differs from the two other games with the same name as it is a hybrid
            of various genres such as platform action, motorcycle racing, puzzle solving and even some adventure
            elements.

            In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade you play Indy's role in his search for the Holy Grail, but this time
            it is you who chooses which step he will take at each part of his quest. For example, in the very beginning
            you receive a diary about the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a
            telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship called Coronado, and that
            he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail
            and your father, or go to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.

            In the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to different stages throughout
            the game. Each stage presents different game genres. For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of
            the Grail, and you have to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle.
            Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch, kick, walk, run, jump and
            use his whip.

            The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.

            The six main game modes are represented on the main menu by pentagonal facets on a stylised football, they
            are:
            Open Play: Here the player can select any of the A Teams (22 players) or Under 23 teams (18 players) and
            play a single match in a stadium of their choosing. These matches can be player vs player, player vs cpu or
            cpu vs cpu. For each team the game's difficulty, and the motivation of the team, goalkeeper etc can be
            customised
            World League: Again using any of the A teams or Under 19 teams the player takes part in a round robin league
            to become world champion. The league can have as few as four or as many as thirty two teams in it, and the
            tournament can be a single match or a two match round robin affair.
            The International Cup: This is played between sixty four A teams which are divided into sixteen groups of
            four for the preliminary round. The top thirty two teams then take part in the Group League with the top
            sixteen taking part in the Final Tournament
            The Under 23 International Cup: This is played between thirty two teams which are divided into eight groups
            of four for the preliminary round.
            P.K.: This is a penalty kick shootout competition
            Scenario Mode: Ten situations most of which involve trying to win a match, or avoid losing, in the last few
            minutes of the game. each can be played with up to five difficulty settings
            Under 23 League:


            Players can train and edit their teams, change the formations and tactics before the match. During the match
            they can adjust camera angles, make substitutions and tactical changes, adjust the game speed and so on. The

        <story>Jack Nicklaus Golf brings Accolade's golf series to the Game Boy with a selection of courses from the
            computer versions and most features and options also present.

            Four courses are available: Jack's Greatest, Castle Pines and Desert Mountain as previously seen in Greatest
            18 Holes and Muirfield Village from Unlimited. Gameplay modes are skins (for two to four players) and stroke
            play (for one to four players). Players can choose their golfer's gender and select from beginner and expert
            skill levels and different tee modes (professional, men's and women's). Besides playing the complete course,
            there are also practice options for a single hole, the green, and a driving range.

            Playing a hole begins with a top-down overview of the hole, followed by the standard view from behind the
            golfer. Strokes are done with the standard three-click method: start, power, and accuracy. During play, it
            is possible to pull up the hole overview, look at the score card and statistics and change the weather
            conditions. The game also offers replays and mulligans.</story>

            throughout such landscapes as giant toy factories and arctic snowfields during his quest, facing down all
            manner of dangerous enemies and obstacles. He can jump and he can launch a large fist from his stomach (he
            is a blob, after all). Further, different levels have special power-ups that allow the blob to assume
            different forms that are useful in specific circumstances. These include a hot air balloon (for floating up
            to special items), a hammer (for smashing obstructing blocks), a submarine (for more effectively navigating
            an undersea bonus level), a skateboard (for blazing through a level on a deadline), and a pogo stick (for
            extra high jumping). Not all of the power-ups are useful, though. One item turns Jelly Boy into a block so
            that he is unable to move for several seconds.

            Jelly Boy collects musical notes in lieu of having a power meter. Being hit knocks away all of his collected
            notes and if he gets hit again without having any notes, he will lose a life. Jelly Boy also collects a
            variety of fruit throughout his quest. Accumulate enough fruit to earn extra lives. Certain types of fruit
            have other side effects (orange = more time on the clock, avocado = invincibility).</story>

        <story>Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the
            1995 movie that tarnished that name. The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console
            jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they
            surrender and can be arrested.

            The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the
            Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence. Following the fight at the top of the
            Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the
            comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</story>

            The game starts just after the T-Rex pushes the visitor's van into it's pit. You play the role of Dr. Alan
            Grant, so you have to find Tim and Lex, take them to the Visitor's center and get everybody out of the
            island. But this time it won't be half as easy as it was on the movie.

            The game is split in two missions, played in two different ways. The first mission is to take Tim and Lex
            back to their grandfather and is (almost exclusively) played from a top-down perspective. The second mission
            involves getting the power back on line and returning alive, so everybody can leave the island and is played

        <story>Prince Richard and Prince Sablé have been rivals since they were young. When news arrives of a princess
            in a far-off kingdom who requires rescuing, Richard dashes off in the hopes of saving her before Sablé
            manages to. Left to catch up, Sablé explores the land, and soon becomes cursed, turning into a frog whenever
            a strange bell is heard. Sablé must remove the curse and rescue the princess.

            Kaeru No Tame Ni Kane Wa Naru is an action-adventure game. The game plays in two modes: a top-down view
            (where most exploration and battle is done), and a side-scrolling view (where more puzzle solving is done
            than battles). Battling is not actually performed by the player, instead it is all automatic. If you bump
            into an enemy, you will see a dust cloud appear, and the pair will scuffle, with each character's health
            draining. Whoever loses all their health first loses the battle. Sablé can increase his battle advantage by
            collecting heart containers (to increase his life bar), and power ups that increase statistics like power
            and defense.

            Another feature of Kaeru No Tame Ni Kane Wa Naru is Sablé's ability to transform into a frog at certain
            points in the game. This allows him to access areas that he previously could not. The main goal of the game
            is to conquer a huge castle, however, sections are sealed off until you complete parts of the story,
            allowing you to explore it in small parts at a time.</story>

            tournament known as "Killer Instinct". Many fighters answer the challenge to participate, including several
            of Ultratech's experimental warriors. To increase the tournament's challenge, Ultratech utilizes a
            technology that can create bridges between alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known as Eyedol.
            Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, Gargos. Some
            warriors enter the tournament to seek glory or escape. Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to
            Ultratech's corruption.

            Killer Instinct is a 2D versus fighting game that features 3D rendered sprite based graphics. Players choose
            from ten characters: Orchid, Cinder, Jago, Glacius, Fulgore, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal, T.J. Combo, and
            Thunder. The game is known for its heavy combo-based fighting system, allowing players to pull off moves
            that land a high number of hits on their opponent, the highest being the "Ultra Combo". The game also

        <story>Different from the NES game of the same name. In the game the player takes on the role of the legendary
            Prince Valiant licensed from the cartoon series of the same name which is in turn based on the comic series
            Prince Valiant. Prince Valiant must lead Arthur's armies against the Tyrant Cynan. The goal is to capture
            all his castles or defeat all his armies.

            A giant over-map shows the world and is divided in tiles. Each tiles has different terrain and shows whether
            units or castles are present in a tile. Tiles are either white or gray depending on whether Arthur or Cynan
            controls it.

            Characters on the map can be directly controlled after being selected. This happens in a top-down view
            similar to The Legend of Zelda. Characters can attack and jump. Each character has different attacks. Items
            can be collected and the player can move freely between tiles. Moving through tiles that are occupied by the
            enemy conquers those territories, but the enemy can take them back at any time by moving through them again.
            If two enemy units meet on the same tile, combat ensues. In real time the player must try to defeat the AI
            opponent. This is done through dodging his attack and trying to land a blow. To conquer a castle all enemies
            including those in adjacent tiles must be defeated.

            It is also possible to find and collect items in the direct control mode. Items serve as power-ups that for
            example make the player faster or restore health points.The player can return to a castle at any time to
            heal completely.

            The player can select the size of the world to increase or decrease the game's length. Additionally he or
            she and change the difficulty of the AI player (Cynan) and select a handicap for himself. It is also
            possible to play against another player.</story>

            Lands.

            The game is divided into three tables or Pinball Lands, each consisting of four screens, three ordinary
            screens, and a boss screen If you fall off the bottom of the lowest one, you lose a life, unless you press A
            at the right moment to activate the springboard, which becomes harder each time. Each screen has a variety
            of things to do. The middle screen will give access to some sort of bonus game, where you must try to get as
            many points as you can, and can add to your bonus and bonus multiplier. The bonus is added to your score
            when you lose a life, as in ordinary pinball.

            The aim is to defeat each boss. To get to the boss you must perform a task on the top ordinary screen. The
            bosses themselves must be defeated by firing Kirby at them, but they will try to stop you, sometimes by
            temporarily de-activating one or both of the flippers. If you defeat the boss on each table, you face Kind

        <story>Kirby's Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game. There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial,
            Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two
            like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically. The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are
            then removed from play. Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the
            following types:

            Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between
            two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the
            higher the score.

            Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the
            Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star
            Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.

            Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all
            blocks in the same row.

            Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they
            transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.

            The game also features a 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks.
            If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount
            of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further.

            force to launch himself further and faster than he can run. A forward spin will launch him forward, and a
            backspin will launch him straight upward. This greatly aids in exploration of each stage, allowing for very
            long or high jumps. There are also a number of power-ups to be found, including Ice Potato and Rocket
            Potato.

            The game is made up of a number of zones, each with six stages. At the end of each zone, Potato must face
            off against a food-themed boss enemy, such as a stack of plates or a giant ice cream cone.</story>

            of racing through success on 60 race tracks across The United States. In each division there are 20 rival
            racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.

            The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other
            championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. Before each race you will be told
            of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.

            When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point
            the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race
            despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed) or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss
            of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.

            Each race costs money to enter and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other
            championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you
            bet, whichever is lower. If a local wins you get your stake back.

            Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro
            boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section
            within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.</story>

        <story>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen
            King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for
            Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of
            primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.

            With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a
            guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a
            human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as
            mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and
            while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5,
            reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe
            starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started
            the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

            While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are
            platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in
            typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after
            collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first
            hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.

            The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all
            involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four
            different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach
            (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and
            reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third
            person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of
            enemies in a VR tunnel).</story>

            There are two modes of play, The Fish and Raise.

            The Fish: As a young boy, you must search out the fish called Guardian, the only fish in the river that can
            cure a disease caught by your sister, Teruyo. This mode combines RPG elements such as buying items, talking
            to the town's folk and searching the local river for the Guardian fish. The fishing element comes into play
            when you bait or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a fish.

            Raise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the many
            Pokémon type games, you can feed it, keep the tank clean and raise the fish.</story>

            You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the
            Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including
            climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming
            to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a
            different percentage target in order to progress.</story>

        <story>The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings have
            split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they
            include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10
            levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.

            Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The
            Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.

            The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal),
            building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand
            pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can
            cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there
            are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.

            Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing
            or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for
            that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the hope of saving
            more Lems.

            Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in
            order to be unable to progress. The game saves your progress rather than using passwords as in the first
            game.</story>

        <story>Lingo is a digital version of the TV game show of the same name. Like in the game show it is the
            objective to guess five letter words. You are only given the first letter.

            You get several tries and with each try the letters are marked which are correctly placed and those who
            appear in the word but at a different location. Within words you get to blindly draw a ball from a pool.


            There are 17 numbered balls that correspond with a numbers on a bingo card. There's a ball with a question
            mark that let the players pick a number at will. When the players complete a row or column they receive
            bonus points.


            There's also three red balls that passes the turn to the other player and three green balls. A green ball
            allows you to pick another ball and also when you get three green balls before the game is over you win a
            jackpot. The game starts with two players, but after some rounds the player with most points goes to the
            finale. The game is in Dutch so only features Dutch words. It contains a library of 15,000 words. There's
            also options for six and seven letter games. It is officially licensed by the Dutch iteration of the game
            show and thus includes the Dutch TV presenter François Boulangé.</story>

            prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom.
            When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is
            banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his
            return.

            The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a
            young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the
            levels represents a part of the movie.

            As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to
            scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your "roar meter" to
            charge.

            As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws
            (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen).

            The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.

        <story>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including
            simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the
            player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty
            space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.

            Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so
            there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which
            pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.

            Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply
            make loops, gaining extra points for size and style.

            Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score and uses a bonus multiplier
            method depending on loop difficulty.

            The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player
            has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting
            the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.

            Standard game modes include exhibition games, full seasons (including playoffs) and playoffs. Special modes
            include Championship playoffs - featuring 38 legendary champion teams, including Green Bay '66, San

            allows players to select from all regular, champion and franchise teams plus a regular Madden and an
            all-time Madden team. Game length can be set between 20, 40 and 60 minutes.

            than 60 defensive plays, all of which can be flipped. The game also features freely definable audibles,
            substitutions (quarterback and halfback only), timeouts, and game stats.

            Gameplay during a game is seen from the top, with the field scrolling vertically. Players are moved via the
            D-pad and the Game Boy's two buttons are used for throwing the ball left or right during passing play,

            new expansion teams Carolina and Jacksonville as well as rule changes like the two-point conversion are
            incorporated.

            Game modes have been cut down from the predecessor: the only remaining ones are exhibition, season and
            playoffs. In addition to the 30 regular teams, there is an All-Madden team for use in exhibition games only.

            definable audibles, timeouts, and detailed stats. The playbook has been reworked, substitutions are now
            available for all positions and the game features quarterback speech for the first time.

            Game perspective (top-down, vertically scrolling) and controls are mostly unchanged from the predecessor.

        <story>Magnetic Soccer is based on table football (and not magnetic football as the name implies): each team has
            eight athletes which are divided into four rows (1-2-3-2). Those rows can be moved left and right (in
            contrast to the real game, all rows are moved at once) and turned in order to kick the ball. Players also
            can stop the ball and perform powerful shots which incapacitate enemy athletes (except the goalkeeper) when
            hit. The goal is to score more goals than the opponent; a draw results in a penalty shootout.

            The game features various playing options including three different surfaces, multiplayer, a training mode
            without an enemy team, a spectator mode for AI matches and three difficulty levels.</story>

            to play as either the men or woman's team of four different countries which are the United States of

            best of three.

            The gameplay involves the typical set of rules for volleyball. Players try to score points by getting the
            ball to land on their opponents side of the court. Typical volleyball moves are also present such as bumping
            the ball and spiking. The match ends when a team's score reaches a set amount of points.

            Options allow the player to turn the music on or off.</story>

        <story>Nonograms are number puzzles where logic is used to find the solution. Clues are provided along the sides
            of the playfield grid, telling the player how many squares to fill in each row and column. With logic the
            player can figure out exactly which squares of the grid to fill. The thinking process is similar to solving
            Sudoku puzzles.

            Mario's Picross (from PICture CROSSword) is Nintendo's take on Nonograms. In this game, Mario takes on the
            role of an archaeologist who chisels away the squares in each playfield. The result is a small picture.
            There are 256 different puzzles to solve, divided into four courses with increasing difficulty level.

            can take their ability as your own, which can provide an advantage against other types of evil robots.

            In this Game Boy version, Mega Man must fight against Ice Man, Electric Man, Cut Man, and Fire Man. After he
            defeats those four he battles Quick Man, Heat Man, Bubble Man, and Flash Man. And after that, there's Dr.

            the world doomed?

            Mega Man 2 is the sequel to the NES game Mega Man. In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man,

            Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand
            by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.

        <story>Mega Man 3 is a traditional side-scrolling platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits
            and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the
            first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely
            walking.

            Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out
            with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires
            the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he
            also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and
            with the added ability to hop around out of the water (you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet
            continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just
            like boss weapons.

            When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may
            pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon
            with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are
            eight of these, corresponding to the eight main levels, even though there are twenty-one levels in the
            entire game.

            Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can
            only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You start the game with three lives. Other features
            include Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. There are infinite continues and a password feature to
            resume play at the beginning of any level.</story>

        <story>Mercenary Force is an unconventional shoot'em up set in Japan's Edo period and inspired by Japanese
            history and mythology. When Japan is invaded by the minions of a dark lord, the shogun sets out to hire the
            best warriors in the land to combat the enemy.

            Players start with 5000 yen and must begin by hiring their mercenaries. The team has four slots and can be
            recruited from five different character types (servant, ninja, monk, samurai and mystic) in any combination
            (including more than one of any character). The characters differ in hiring price, starting health, weapons
            (amount of projectiles, speed and direction), and their special attack.

            The game consists of six levels, seen from an angled top-down/side-view perspective, with the screen
            scrolling automatically to the right. The mercenaries must shoot hordes of enemies to get to the next level,
            including several bosses. The mercenaries can change their formation between four different options: a
            vertical line, a diamond shape, a square shape and a horizontal arrowhead formation. It is also possible to
            switch the character in the lead position, leading to a large variety of tactical options. The hit points of
            each team member are counted individually, so if one is killed the remaining ones can fight on. Besides
            their standard weapon, each character also has a special suicide attack, triggered by pressing both buttons
            at the same time. These are usually highly devastating attacks, but the monk's power actually allows the
            group to skip ahead through a large part of the level.

            Killed enemies drop coins of 10 yen in value that disappear after a short while if not picked up. The money
            reserve is used in a matter of ways: between stages, new recruits can be hired to replace fallen fighters.
            There are also various buildings in the levels that allow the spending of money. Cafes offer various items
            that restore or increase health and, in some levels, can change the character class of the team leader.
            There is a fortune-reading at a temple which makes it possible to recruit a hidden character, and the
            possibility to resurrect fallen comrades at a daibutsu. Only temples don't cost money and offer healing for
            free.</story>

        <story>Metal Masters is a one versus one fighting game with robots. Each robot has two basic attacks: ranged and
            melee; which one is used depends on how close the opponent is. In each scenario, the player can control the
            attacks of the robot: when in ranged mode the used weapon system is chosen (each of the four body parts has
            its own) and during melee combat, the direction of the punches is controlled.

            Each successful hit gives points which decide the winner if no fighter goes down within the time limit. A
            knockdown is achieved by emptying the opponent's life bar. Additionally each hit (with a big bonus for
            winning) gives prize money which in turn is invested in upgrading the robot. The player can buy new parts
            for the four components (main body, legs and the individual arms) - but an upgraded robot also influences
            the difficulty of the next enemy. While being inside a fight, the AI can be set to take over the own robot.

            and traps and even magic wands to create ice and fire. Let's not get any closer!"

            All this chatter aroused Yashja from her slumber. "So! Who dares disturb my sleep?" she yelled. "You all
            shall pay!" Suddenly, a gaping hole opened up under Mickey's friends and they all fell in. Now Mickey has to
            save his friends, who are now being held captive by the witch!

            To save his friends, Mickey has to collect puzzle pieces that completes images of his Disney friends,
            including Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and even obscure characters like Grandma Duck from the comic book

            would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of
            Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind
            those earthquakes.

            Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play
            with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help
            them in several tasks.

            Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean
            the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must
            clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

            After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For
            instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among
            the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

            Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and

            evil Ivan Ooze who is trying to control the universe.

            There are six different levels to play in each with their own standard obstacles and enemies, mid-level
            bosses and of course end bosses that range from Mordant, Lord Zedd to Ivan Ooze himself. There are no
            weapons that can be used, instead the player must rely on kicks and punches to dispatch enemies and pick up
            health items left behind.

            Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but are more
            weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping abilities of the
            other Rangers. Players can refill their health by picking up heart icons and power icons to increase their

            Muddy solve the many puzzles of Jinbei Land. Snatch all of Jinbei's cabbages in every level, and if you get
            stuck, dig underground and create your own secret underground paths. A word of warning, however - Jinbei has
            got his best goons guarding your family, so you'd better watch out!

            Mole Mania plays from an overhead perspective. Although in each room you have to destroy all the foes to
            progress, the game is much more puzzle-oriented than it is towards action. It is quite common in later
            levels to get yourself 'stuck', which can be fixed by leaving and returning to the screen to reset the
            puzzle. One of the game's clever 'hooks' is that players can dig underground in each stage to find a
            completely different map than they do above ground, which can be used to get through otherwise impassable
            terrain.

            The game also features a two player mode, where one player is Muddy, and the other is Jinbei. Muddy must
            swipe as many cabbages as possible, and Jinbei must stop him. At the end of the round, players swap roles,
            and then the player who got the most cabbages wins.</story>

            a monster rock musician decides to fight back. In order to defeat the evil monarch, he enlists in the
            training course at the Mega Hero Academy.

            Monster Max is a surreal isometric adventure by the same duo that created the 8-bit classic Head Over Heels.
            Not surprisingly it is very similar to that game in terms of control and general design, and almost
            identical graphically. The character moves on a bizarre landscape, where he has to collect and use objects
            (with either the A or B button) to accomplish mission objectives. The game starts on a training academy that
            serves as the mission hub. Each mission has as an entrance with a terminal and a door. By touching the
            terminal with the character, the mission objective and reward is displayed on the screen. The missions
            available can be played in any order, but Max has to pay a fee to access other levels with more advanced
            missions. On the top left of the screen there is a counter for the lucky stars collected. Lucky stars allow
            the character to touch dangerous objects once without suffering damage. Besides that are several hearts
            representing the number of lives. On the top right is the inventory display, showing the two objects
            assigned to the buttons. Hitting START while on a mission brings up a map, while pressing SELECT displays a
            menu with options and the password at the bottom of the screen.


            The game is far larger than previous isometric adventures like Knight Lore, with over 600 more detailed
            locations (the double of Head Over Heels). There is a password system to save progress.</story>

            Max's plane crashes on an uncharted, deserted island. Max discovers ancient ruins there and ventures to
            explore them, attempting to connect the mystery of the past with the events of the present.

            Montezuma's Return is a sequel to Montezuma's Revenge, and also focuses on platforming gameplay which
            includes puzzle-solving, avoiding obstacles, and fighting enemies. Unlike its predecessor, it is a
            first-person 3D game. The player is able to see the protagonist's feet when moving the camera, to facilitate
            precise platform jumping.

            Every level ends with a boss battle, and each boss must be defeated in a specific way. Max can punch and
            kick enemies, and also use environmental hazards to damage them; pushing enemies into water or luring them
            into traps will kill them. Some areas require Max to jump on moving platforms, climb ropes, swim, avoid
            falling into lava or deadly spikes, etc. Max can collect treasure on each level, bananas or watermelon
            slices to heal himself, and special items to unlock barriers.

            The full version of Montezuma's Revenge is included on the CD.</story>

            Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each
            player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the
            opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the
            loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked
            finale.

            Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to
            represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</story>

        <story>Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn
            used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen
            Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's
            extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.

            A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally
            Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic
            Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the
            mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and
            Queen Sindel herself.

            Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo"
            attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once
            both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and
            finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn
            himself.

            Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature
            motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.

            continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to
            keep the title fresh.

            Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and
            ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and
            tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

            Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the
            maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from
            200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the
            ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

            Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the
            growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of
            "Junior".</story>

        <story>Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing, as the name implies, is a boxing game featuring the three-time World
            Heavyweight Champion. The game display 2D sprite-drawn boxers in a 3D ring (the so-called "FreeCam" 3D
            system), with the boxers moving around the ring in 360°.

            One or two players can choose the number of rounds (up to 15), the round length (up to 5 minutes), the
            number of times a fighter must be taken down to be T.K.O. and the number of referee counts (up to 10). There
            are two game modes: exhibition (which can be played against the computer or one-on-one by two players) and
            the tournament mode (single player). Players can choose among nine fictional fighters plus Muhammad Ali
            himself.

            There are two control types: arcade and simulation. In the arcade mode, the d-pad moves the boxer around,
            while the A button is used for jabs, the B button for defense and the C button for hard punches. In this
            mode, the game decides which of the boxer's arms will be used for each punch. In the simulation mode, the
            d-pad moves the player around. By holding the A button (for the left arm) or C button (for the right arm),
            the player can perform head jabs (by pressing up in the D pad), body jabs (by pressing down), body hooks (by
            pressing left) and body hooks (by pressing right). Holding the B button, the player can cover up (by
            pressing up), duck (by pressing down), sway left (by pressing left) and sway right (by pressing right). By
            pressing A and B together, the boxer performs an uppercut.

            Each fighter has a power and a speed bar. As they get tired by fighting or get hurt, the bars decrease. The
            lower the bars, the slower or weaker the punches get, until the boxer is knocked down. By defending himself
            a boxer can regain power or speed. There's also a counter of punches landed at each side of the screen. If
            the fight ends with no winner, the judges decision is made by those numbers alone, regardless of how many
            times the fighters were taken down during the fight.

            The game features digitized speech, including samples of Ali's voice.</story>

            To solve the mazes you must transform the items which are found in the maze into something more useful. For
            example, a piece of iron turns in a glass key when dropped in a pool of fire. Thus, if you want to pass a

            sometimes require multiple stages. If you keep good notes, you'll find out all possible transformations.

            The make it all a little bit more interesting, there are monsters inhibiting the maze. That problem is

        <story>NBA All-Star Challenge 2 is a basketball game with six mini games, mostly based on real-life one-on-one
            variants. The main differences to the predecessor are the new mini game Slam Dunk (replaces H.O.R.S.E.) and
            slightly reworked graphics for the others. Before each game, the player can choose between 27 real-life
            athletes, one from each NBA team's 1991 roster. All games can be played by two players via the Game Boy link
            cable.

            The disciplines are:
            One On One: A standard one-on-one match which is restricted to the area directly before the basket. The
            winning condition can be set before starting the match: either scoring a certain amount of points or scoring
            the most within a certain time frame.

            Free Throws: This mini game is about a free throw, i.e. trying to score from a fixed place without getting
            disturbed by an opponent. A cursor automatically moves around the basket and when the player presses the
            button, the athlete throws the ball to the cursor's position. The number of throws can be set before the
            game.

            Three Point Shootout: There are five marked points around the basket; directly at the border where scoring
            rewards three points. The athlete stands at each point for a certain amount of time before he switches to
            the next point. A throwing attempt is simply performed by pressing the button twice: first for jumping and
            the second time for throwing the ball. This mini game is available in a training and a competitive variant.

            Slam Dunk: Before each round, the player selects the performed dunk variant from a list. This mode is shown
            from the side, the player moves towards the basket and has to press the right button with the correct timing
            to score. This mode is available in a training (the game gives a few pointers for the timing) and a
            competitive mode.

            Accuracy Shootout: Works similar to Three Point Shootout with the difference that the points are spread all
            over the area. The player needs to walk to the spot and, if the previous shot was missed, collect the ball
            from the place it bounced to. The player can either set the points manually before the mini game starts or
            use the random generator.

            Tournament: A series of one-on-one matches in knock-out mode.</story>

        <story>The Nekketsu gang hits the sands for a grand tournament of beach volleyball. As usual the game mechanics
            have been somewhat modified from other volleyball games in order to include the classic gameplay elements
            from the Nekketsu series that involve adding beat 'em up elements to each sport. You can perform special
            throws and bomb shots as well as collect special power-ups that increase your team's abilities.

            The game includes a standard 1P two-on-two tournament mode as well as a Vs mode for link-up multiplayer.

        <story>Nemesis is the first entry in the long-running Gradius series on the Game Boy. Its side-scrolling
            shoot'em up gameplay follows the series template closely. Players control the Vic Viper through five levels,
            most based on levels in earlier entries, for a kind of 'greatest hits' of the series. There is a cave level
            (as in level 1 of the original Gradius), the mandatory Moai stage, a Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard
            (similar to bonus stages in the MSX and PC Engine version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base.
            Besides the classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new.

            The cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here: collected power ups advance the power meter which can be
            activated at any time to gain the highlighted item. The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups,
            missiles, dual shots, lasers, option satellites and forcefields.

            The game allows players to start in any of the five levels and even to set the number of lives to a maximum
            of 99.</story>

            Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the
            replayability.

            When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and
            you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In
            an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.

            In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give
            simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves.
            The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it

        <story>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal
            states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of
            conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the
            ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga
            Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

            Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is
            similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17
            regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated
            attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these
            values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly
            daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.

            During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include:
            Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or
            Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the
            defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving
            units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the
            enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of
            enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</story>

            conectados y, por tanto, desaparezcan. Sin embargo, a diferencia de los juegos de Tetris, los bloques no se
            pueden girar, sino que se les puede dar la vuelta para que aparezcan otros bloques en el reverso. También
            hay los habituales bloques de bonificación que eliminan filas enteras, como es habitual en este género.
            También hay un modo para dos jugadores, aunque a diferencia de lo que suele ocurrir en los juegos de puzzle
            para dos jugadores, las acciones de uno de ellos no afectarán al otro directamente (como que caigan más
            bloques en la pantalla de tu oponente después de que hayas conseguido una puntuación bastante alta).</story>

        <story>Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the
            third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10
            events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and
            archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players
            can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three
            difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.

            Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the
            first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and
            quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times.

            Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the
            straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple
            jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex
            pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both
            long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the
            second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition
            continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.

            The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier
            to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three
            throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.

            Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points
            as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be
            calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and
            compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet
            is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with
            two slugs for each.</story>

            side-scrolling shooter. You play a Rambo-esque character that goes around shooting everything in sight,
            collecting weapon upgrades and bonuses.

            The game introduces the character of Black Viper to the series' oft-jumbled continuity. Black Viper would
            later return in the Nintendo DS title, Contra 4, as the primary villain.

            The game features only five levels, two of which are played from an overhead perspective similar to Super C.
            Operation C is also notable in featuring the upgradable Spread Gun (from three to five shots) and
            introducing the Hunter Gun.

            There is also the occasional platform element such as jumping puzzles, moving platforms etc., and the

        <story>Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many
            block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

            The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two
            blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's
            directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you
            place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his
            direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game
            ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear
            approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top
            of them will drop.

            Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many
            versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.

            The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no
            more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can
            change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.

            All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</story>

            Pac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the Furries for DOS, Macintosh and Game Boy. It's exactly the same
            game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super Skweek/Tiny
            Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man. However, SNES game, despite using
            the same basic gameplay mechanics, is an entirely new game using a different game engine and aesthetic.

            Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red
            ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One
            touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

            Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During
            this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited
            amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man
            again.

            Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.

        <story>El objetivo del juego es sencillo: derrotar al monstruo y salvar a la chica. El método principal para
            hacerlo es disparar bloques. Los bloques pueden ser disparados por ambos personajes: el personaje de la
            izquierda se controla con B, y el de la derecha con A, y puedes mover los personajes de arriba abajo con el
            D-Pad para cambiar su altura. (Sin embargo, se mueven de forma sincronizada, por lo que no puedes cubrir
            varios niveles). Los bloques disparados irán en línea recta por el campo de juego hasta que choquen con un
            monstruo o con otro bloque. (Las columnas más a la derecha y más a la izquierda siempre estarán llenas de
            bloques, lo que te da un suministro ilimitado). Si se golpea un bloque, el bloque al que se disparó ocupará
            su lugar, y el bloque que estaba allí se moverá un espacio en la dirección del disparo. Entonces, ¿cómo se
            puede derrotar al monstruo? Es bastante sencillo: hay que eliminar los bloques para que el monstruo toque el
            suelo, y se eliminan los bloques emparejándolos por parejas. No importa si las parejas se hacen vertical u
            horizontalmente, siempre que no sean diagonales. Una vez que el monstruo toca el suelo, se destruye; una vez
            que se destruyen todos, se gana el nivel y se pasa al siguiente.</story>

        <story>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It
            features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the
            original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening
            years of advances in programming skill.

            The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define
            intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect,
            and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

            As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of
            18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many
            individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</story>

        <story>PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the most
            advanced one. Instead of offering several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and
            River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the
            console allow).

            The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the
            game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament,
            Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.

            Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set
            strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add
            backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The
            difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible
            to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses
            taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take
            a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</story>

        <story>Picross 2 is the Japanese only sequel to the Game Boy puzzle game, Mario's Picross. Your goal is to
            reveal the hidden picture inside each grid by chipping away the correct squares. Clues along the grid's
            edges help you figure out which squares should be chipped away, and which should be left alone. The puzzles
            are much more advanced than those in Mario's Picross - easy puzzles are in a 15x15 grid, while standard
            Picross puzzles are four 15x15 grids connected together, solved one section at a time.

            Picross 2 has two modes of play: the first, Mario's Picross, has you solving Picross puzzles with Mario. In
            this mode, the timer ticks down from 30 minutes, and you must solve the puzzle before the timer reaches
            zero. If you chip away an incorrect square, you are penalized time (first two minutes, then four, then
            eight).

            After solving a certain amount of puzzles in Mario's Picross mode, you can play Wario's Picross. In this
            mode, the timer starts from zero and counts upwards. You are not penalized time for any mistakes, however,
            this means that you do not know which squares are correct and which ones are incorrect until the puzzle is
            complete.</story>

            unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered
            in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically,
            corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across
            horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a
            piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

            Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds
            to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there
            will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are
            able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but
            for a slight scoring penalty.

            Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the
            flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps
            in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there
            is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each

            license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose
            from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989
            season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when
            your starters get tired.

            Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense,
            and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing
            and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48
            potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting
            games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.

            Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. There are no penalties, but referees
            do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout
            "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains. Team stats are displayed on a summary screen
            after every quarter of play. Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next
            round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!</story>

        <story>Pocahontas is a side-scrolling platformer based on the Native American Indian later made famous in a
            Disney movie by the same name.

            The player alternates between Pocahontas and John Smith to complete seven missions. In levels one, two and
            four, Pocahontas needs to collect feathers for a Shaman woman to receive magic cards, travel through the
            forest while avoiding the spirit beat, and shake off a boy who chases her to prevent her from reaching the
            white man's camp respectively.

            John Smith is playable in the levels three, five and six. In the third level the American explorer needs to
            shoot animals running and passing by, on separate planes, by aiming his gun with the mouse. He needs to
            shoot enough animals to feed his men before it gets dark. The objective is the same in the fifth level, but
            there he is in a canoe and needs to catch fish.


            In the sixth level he leaps over ravines and across rivers until he meets Pocahontas. Together, they help
            each other cross a lake. In the final level both characters are controlled as they need to work together to
            catch a bear.

            Next to regular platforming mechanics such as running, climbing, jumping and swinging, there are some minor
            puzzle elements involving items that are selected from the bottom of the screen. That part also holds a
            progress bar to show how close the objectives are. Characters are generally controlled with four movement
            keys. The mouse cursor is visible on the screen and acts as a guide to show the possible actions. Clicking
            left or right offers different actions.</story>

        <story>Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by a
            monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect
            five Power Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero
            strong enough to defeat such monsters.

            This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters
            within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If
            the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a
            fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.

            Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in
            the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that
            last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your
            jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.</story>

            Heroes Light and Pastel decide to go out and help a young maiden bring sense back to her scientist father,
            who apparently has bumped his head and transformed into a evil mastermind that seeks world domination.

            As the other games in the series Pop'n Twinbee is a vertically-scrolling arcade shooter in which you and a
            friend get behind the controls of Twinbee and Winbee, the cutest starfighters ever created, and try to clear
            stage after stage of enemies with your weapons. Being a console original instead of a port, Pop'n features a
            number of additions to the gameplay mechanics, including an energy bar, eight difficulty levels and a
            handicap feature when playing with a friend (which makes most enemies target one fighter instead of the
            other).

            The upgrade system remains consistent with the series's: you shoot colored bells which give different
            power-ups when collected, including multiple shots, "options" and shield energy. Also when correctly
            powered-up both fighters can join and perform powerful team-up moves.</story>

            The scenario is a maze and the player controls Popeye who has a time limit to collect some hearts, find
            Olive Oyl and save Swee'Pea which only appears somewhere to be saved after the hearts were collected and
            Olive found.
            Popeye should avoid Bluto in order to prevent a fight with him, not losing time. When the fight is
            inevitable, and if Olive is already found, Popeye will lose her, and after the fight ends, he has to find
            her again. Bluto can drop weapons and enemies such as cannons and animals. He also steals the hearts and
            when it happens the heart will appear somewhere else to be collected. J. Wellington Wimpy is always
            wandering around and puts hamburgers that eventually block Popeye's path, however he can put so much as
            remove by eating them. A "flying" can of spinach will sometimes appear during the game anytime and out of
            nowhere, and can be used to increase Popeye's strength: be faster and the ability to eliminate enemies
            released by Bluto and Wimpy's hamburgers that obstruct the path. There are three playable courses and each
            one has five stages. In the game ending, Popeye gets married to Olive Oyl in front of a church.

            spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after
            Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.


            Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site
            where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and
            bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must
            be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every
            vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up
            a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the
            next level.


            The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach
            building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are
            replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges
            and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye
            climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with
            Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.


            Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this
            vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits
            before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye
            has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.</story>

            Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is
            inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating

            take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

            When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around
            the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward
            the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people. He will burn; he
            will kill. And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

            But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the gods have other tools as well. You can drown
            your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers, submerge their towns in swamps, or raise a
            volcano in the middle of their best farmland. Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people
            who didn't build on high ground.

            And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer. A god's play is just never done.</story>

        <story>Power Racer is a conversion of the arcade game Head On that includes an extra special mode. The normal
            mode is a faithful recreation of the original: the playing field consists of a square race track with four
            lanes. Between the corners the lanes are partly interrupted so the lane can be changed. This is needed
            because on the uninterrupted parts there are dots which all have to be picked up to progress to the next
            level. There is also another (on higher levels two) car on the track which tries to crash into the player -
            of course this needs to be avoided. This mode features ten difficulty levels.

            The special mode adds a few things to the basic playing principle. In this mode there are three difficulty
            levels and nine tracks which all add variations to the playing field, e.g. a different lane layout, oil
            slicks which cause the car to spin when driving over it or conveyor belts. There are also a few power ups
            which randomly appear on the track and need to be picked up within a limited time frame. Most of them are
            not activated instantly and can be used at a opportune time. The power ups are a bomb (causes a near enemy
            to spin), a level skip, an extra live, a shield, an enemy slow down and one which causes all cars to make a
            u-turn. This mode can be played by two human players.</story>

        <story>While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a
            coup d'état. His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and
            threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the
            dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar
            before the terrible marriage takes place.

            Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform
            genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement
            through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping
            technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.

            The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as
            stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player
            character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies,
            and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be
            replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.

            The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis
            version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.</story>

        <story>Puyo Puyo is a falling pieces puzzle, with basic similarities to Tetris. Pairs of puyos (monsters from
            Compile's RPG series Mad? Monogatari)
            fall down from the top into a cylinder. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and
            made to drop faster. The goal is to get four puyos of the same color touching each other horizontally or
            vertically. Doing so removes them from the field. Making groups of larger than four, several at the same
            time or creating chain reactions nets more points. The game ends once the stacked puyos reach the top of the
            cylinder.

            The game offers an endless single-player mode, a two-player mode (first player to fill their cylinder loses)
            and a mission mode. Mission mode presents the player with a number of pre-filled playing fields with a
            preset task, like making a minimum number of puyos disappear in one move, or removing all puyos of a certain
            color.</story>

        <story>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to manoeuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear
            them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can
            move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

            There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move
            a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations
            there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks
            one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with two others, and immediately
            removing all three. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in
            level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible
            (by forming a stack, for example).

            The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of
            two sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two
            sets on level 2, three on level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220
            screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out
            of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your three lives.</story>

        <story>In Q Billion, you play a mouse which must level out a playfield filled with stacks of tiles. To do this,
            the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until
            there are no tiles stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each other,
            which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have something to stand on. Since the
            mouse is so weak, it can only move a single tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a
            stack of three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a stack of two
            tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the stack
            onto the single tile in order to create a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance
            greater than one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a lot of
            planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles pioneered by Sokoban.

            Later stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These tiles will,
            when moved together in groups of four, be eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for
            three-dimensional ? or even four-dimensional ? thinking on behalf of the player. None of the special tiles
            must be left on the screen for the stage to be cleared.

            A second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a limited amount of time. An
            editing mode will also allow the player to create levels of his own.</story>

        <story>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay. You
            control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

            The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without
            firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of
            energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in
            your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called
            "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any
            enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an
            offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type,
            since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in
            order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main
            gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser
            beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one
            follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

            The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien
            movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi
            mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the
            fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with
            intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes,
            without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</story>

        <story>Race Drivin' is a sequel to the driving simulator Hard Drivin'. Game play is similar to the first game.
            The player must complete laps around the race track before a timer expires. There are several checkpoints
            around the track which increase player's time as he passes.

            Race Drivin' has three courses, one of which is the track from Hard Drivin'. There is a new super-stunt
            track, and an autocross course. The player also may choose from three types of cars.</story>

        <story>Racing Damashii is a motorcycle racing game with six courses. It is basically action-oriented, but the
            player needs to watch the damage of the motorcycle (decreases with crashes) and the tire condition
            (decreases when leaving the road). If one of the two bars runs out, the race is over, but repairs are
            conducted during pit stops. The two playing modes for single-player are training races and a championship in
            which points are awarded for good end positions. Those can be reinvested into motorcycle upgrades. The
            perspective is 3D with the camera fixed behind the player's vehicle.</story>

        <story>Radar Mission is mostly a Battleship board game clone with two game modes. The first is very
            recognizable, with a map to select and place the ships. Then the game is played by picking squares (e.g.
            A5). There are several different ships, ranging from the five-hit aircraft carriers to the two hit cruisers,
            even a fighter jet in later levels.

            The second mode is more of a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a submarine, trying to destroy the
            enemy fleet before they take the player's vessel out. Either the player takes out all the battleships
            causing the enemy submarine to surrender or he directly destroys the submarine to end the level. When
            submerged a radar view appears, showing the player's ships along with the enemies, providing a strategic
            intermission to plot out the attack.</story>

            supposed to sift out the best fighter in the universe.

            Each of the seven fighters has a variety of punches and kills - which one gets performed depends on which
            directions on the d-pad are pressed. Every fighter differs from the others with two special attacks which
            are triggered by pressing the right button combination and a few statistics like speed or defense.

            Besides the story mode, the player can also participate in the training mode with a motionless opponent, a
            tournament or two-player matches. The winner of a match is whoever wins two rounds out of three.</story>

        <story>The Real Ghostbusters, known as Garfield Labyrinth in Europe and Mickey Mouse IV: Mahou no Labyrinth in
            Japan, is a puzzle/platform game. The story is very simple: Venkman (or Garfield and Odie or Mickey and Mini
            Mouse, depending on the version you play) walk over a bridge one day, a tile breaks loose and
            Venkman/Garfield/Mickey falls down a deep pit, which ends up in a bizarre labyrinth, which
            Venkman/Garfield/Mickey must escape. There's no other goal apart from that, the player just needs to find
            the exit in each level. Apart from getting there, the exit must also be unlocked. For the latter, the player
            must collect all gems in the level.

            Each level contains various traps and enemies which need to be avoided. The puzzles involve finding keys to
            lower bridges or open doors, make use of teleporters and especially: drilling away blocks. Conveniently, the
            player finds a pneumatic hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be used to create paths to certain
            areas and items, without blocking the way forth or back. There's also an inventory to store items like keys
            and bombs (used to kill enemies). The protagonist has a health bar and can take several hits before losing a
            life, but there is also a time limit for each level.

            The game features a password system, a password is given automatically after completing a level.

            In spite of the differences in main character and a minor variation in the short intro cinematic all
            regional versions are identical.</story>

            Players can compete in the standard, 1-Player v. CPU, 1-Player v. 2-Player or even a career mode, where
            there are four preset fighters to choose from along with an option to create customers boxers. The career

        <story>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes
            part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always
            to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by
            playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other
            racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular
            road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

            By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better
            bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose
            valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is
            possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

            Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle
            simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</story>

            the amount of races they want to compete in (5, 10, 15, or 20). After that is decided, players choose from
            one of six different drivers. Each driver comes with their own weight and guts percentage, and have
            different starting body and tire ratings for their roadster.

            During a race players have to compete against five other drivers trying to get the best placed finish. While
            in the race, players can make pit stops to repair any tire wear or body damage they sustained while out on
            the track. Points are earned depending on where the player finished the race. More points are awarded for
            the better finish.
            The ultimate champion is the driver who totals the most points after a series of races.

            There is occasionally a power-up that can be picked up during a race. After the race this is collected in,
            this power-up can be spent on either increasing the statistics of the body or tire rating.

            The game also offers the option if they want to race with the music on or off.</story>

            up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence
            Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

            Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the
            game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left,
            right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore
            health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot
            and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.

            Amiga and Atari ST versions are faithful to the original level design of the Arcade game, but they also add
            first-person rescue hostage scenarios, and a mini-game where the player needs to match the suspects' faces

            very loosely on a Dark Horse comic.

            The player controls RoboCop, who, while taking care of law &amp; order in Detroit, discovers some unusual
            troublemakers: Terminators sent from the future. To deal with the threat, Robo will have to make his way
            through an OCP factory and computer complex, where a time machine awaits that will take him to the
            post-nuclear wasteland of future Los Angeles. There, he must destroy the Skynet mainframe to free humanity
            from the machines once and for all.

            The game is a platforming affair. RoboCop must destroy various enemies while looking for the level exit,
            from various criminals in Detroit to advanced robotic probes, Terminators and flying Hunter Killers in in
            the OCP labs and the future. He is armed with a simple gun which can be upgraded once to a three-directional
            scatter shot. A single hit means the gun upgrade is lost, though. Life energy can be refilled through

            hacerlos desaparecer alineando cuatro del mismo color. El juego es una variación de Puyo, sólo que con
            algunos trucos diferentes, pero es bastante bueno. Cuando borras un bloqueo, los PS de tu oponente se
            reducen, lo que le da un sabor a juego de rol. Un triunfo de la dirección. Si lo juegas con Super Game Boy,
            es muy divertido.</story>

        <story>Taking a rather literal view of the term 'slap-stick humour', Rodland features two fairies called Tam and
            Rit, whose mission is to rescue their mum who's been captured and taken to a castle.

            There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and
            flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as
            it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.

            When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which
            can be used to kill other enemies.

            Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still
            alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death
            results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.

            In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when
            climbing ladders.</story>

        <story>Roger Clemens is known by some as the greatest pitcher in baseball history. In Roger Clemens' MPV
            Baseball players play a standard a 9 innings baseball game in Exhibition mode and a full regular season can
            be played including the World Championship Playoffs in the Regular Season mode. While playing in Regular
            Season mode the player can see their chosen team?s progress by using the in game calendar showing all the
            games.

            Players select a fictional team from the following groups:
            National Division West: San Francisco Quakes, Los Angeles Apaches, Cincinnati Big Cats, San Diego Suns,
            Houston Mustangs, and Atlanta Condors.

            National Division East: Chicago Swords, Montreal Lumberjacks, New York Buffalos, St. Louis Commandos,
            Pittsburgh Panthers, and Philadelphia Generals.

            American Division West: Oakland Bashers, Seattle Pioneers, Minnesota Hounds, California Waves, Texas
            Cowboys, Chicago Red Birds, and Kansas City Kings.

            American Division East: Toronto Bears, Boston Hornets, New York Rebels, Detroit Wheels, Milwaukee Marshals,
            Baltimore Eagles, and Cleveland Tomahawks.Each team has a set of players the make up the team each with
            their own skill level and statistics which, like the teams, is fictional other then Clemens himself who is
            on the Boston Hornets team.

            When controlling the pitcher the player can control the speed and spin of the pitch as well as the pitchers
            position on the plate. The pitcher can also stop the opponent stealing a base which can be seen via windows
            showing the positions of all the baserunners. When controlling the batter the player has to time the hit to
            successfully hit the ball so it will not be a missed hit or a foul, or has the option to not hit in case of
            a ?ball?. The player can also steal a base while batting. After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding
            mode where the camera shifts to a view that is lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder gets
            smaller as he moves away from the camera). The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the
            ball and then throw it to the selected base. There are many different cameras angles that the game selects
            depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in
            ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball.

            The player can use a password to save their progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition match can be
            played in two player mode with the use of two controllers.</story>

            completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform
            the same duties.

            Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to
            various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task.
            Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives,
            termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and
            completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles.
            Underwater is a dangerous place.

            The vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed.
            It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing
            left and facing right
            Stinger: A prototype "next generation" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any
            direction to fire your weapon accurately.
            Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can
            dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a
            water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill
            Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and
            right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up
            undersea objects for transport
            Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose
            however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches
            Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the
            vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself
            and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach.

        <story>Shanghai is one of the first video game adaptations of the tile-based game played with the Chinese
            mahjong stones - essentially a puzzle game that has little to do with real mahjong rules.

            The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them
            into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be
            removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

            This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset
            challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</story>

        <story>This is a portable edition of the solitaire game Shanghai, the game uses traditional Mah Jong tiles. The
            aim of the game is to match tiles, four of each type will be put on the playing field, when two tiles are
            matched they are removed when none remain you win. Only tiles that can be moved freely to the left or right
            may be matched. A wrong move may result in you not being able to clear the field.

            A slight story mode is presented in the Shanghai mode; each tile setup is based on a Zodiac animal that
            needs it power restored. The goal is to complete all twelve of these stages there by restoring the animals
            power.

            Some variants are also included:Kong Kong: Compete against a computer to clear tiles. If you go slowly you
            will have tiles sent over to your by your opponent. This type of play is similar to games like Puyo Pop.
            Kong Kong may be played against another player by using a link cable or against a computer.

            Challenge (WonderSwan only): A large Shanghai game that you'll try to race through to get the best score.

            Goldrush: In this mode you will race against an opponent to reach a tile marked 'G'. G is for GOLD, boy! So
            get cracking.</story>

            important role, meaning that you cannot immediately stop and sometimes need to drive at full speed to manage
            wider jumps. The top-down levels play more similar to other Skate Or Die games as gradients influence your
            driving while you are trying to avoid obstacles, enemies and deadly spikes.</story>

            It has fourteen levels of single-player action some featuring the Gorgonite Archer, others featuring the
            commando Chip Hazard. You assume the role of Archer, who has to defend his world against an invasion of the
            commandos. You can run, jump, climb ledges and fight using a blaster. Many levels involve freeing captured
            Gorgonites who then help you fight. Multiplayer includes two head-to-head two-player Chip vs. Archer mode
            where you either need to capture flags or get a set amount of frags.</story>

            Sneaky Snakes is a pseudo-sequel to the NES game Snake, Rattle 'n Roll. However, instead of an isometric
            playfield, the game is this time a standard sidescrolling platformer. Players can play as Attila (or link up
            and play simultaneously with a friend as Genghis) through various devious levels. The goal of each level is
            to eat enough Nibbleys (round creatures which come in assorted flavors including balloons, jellyfish,
            joggers, and more) to earn enough tail segments. When your snake has enough segments, its body will flash,
            and you can weigh yourself to open the exit gate and progress to the next level.

            Each level has a time limit of 99 seconds - if this runs out, a giant ax will appear, chasing after your
            snake until it eventually destroys it. To prevent this from occurring, you can collect clocks which add
            another 30 seconds to your time limit. You can also collect power ups such as increased jump height, tongue
            extensions, and diamonds which briefly make you invincible.</story>

            horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

            Combinations can be made if the color of more than two of the same edge pieces match. Once an entire row of
            fruits match, it will be cleared and the fruits that didn't match will drop. However, as time played in each
            stage progresses, the top of the board will begin to drop. If a fruit reaches the top of the board, the game
            will end.

            Some game pieces that help to clear the board. Along the right side of the screen is the word "extra".
            Occasionally, a letter from that word will drop. If all of the letters are on the board, a pixie will appear
            to clear multiple fruits from the board.

            However, some pieces hinder the ability to clear the board. A "sekiero" piece will occasionally drop, which
            takes up all four spaces in the square. In order to clear the sekiero, the entirety of both of the
            horizontal rows around the sekiero must match. If a stage goes on for too long, an enemy will appear to
            occasionally throw bombs which change the color of the fruits and impede progress.

            A stage is cleared when all of the fruits have been cleared from the board.</story>

            adding many power-ups and enemies.

            You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and
            columns, at one of three skill levels. You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to
            Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven
            more less common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders
            in a row. As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this
            version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after
            fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game,

        <story>This 1991 release was intended to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the 60's television series. The
            plot of this Trek is based around a giant "Doomsday Machine" that is destroying ships, planets, and other
            valuable stuff in federation space. The Federation has constructed a weapon to defeat the doomsday machine,
            but the Klingons think that it will be used against them. So, they steal the weapon and break it up into 12
            pieces spread out over 3 planets.

            It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to travel to the 3 planets, recover all 12 pieces of the weapon, and
            finally stop the Doomsday Machine. There are two modes of game play. First, there is a side-scrolling
            shoot-em-up in which you pilot the Enterprise through asteroid fields and enemy fleets. Second, there is a
            overhead-view game in which you maneuver Captain Kirk around the planet to gather up the pieces of the
            weapon.</story>

            The protagonist has two means of attack: his fists and a stomp attack which, in addition to the damage, can

            player can choose to upgrade one of the two attacks or increase his maximum health. The mini games are sumo
            wrestling, arm wrestling and thumb wrestling.

        <story>Super Black Bass is a bass fishing game where players can compete in four different lake tournaments.
            Player can fish in: Skywater Lake (Local Amateur), Clear Lake (Amateur), Murphy Lake (Pro) and Bluestone
            Lake (Super Bass), the goal of which is to catch a certain weight limit of bass before a certain time limit.

            There are two screens, the boating screen where players navigate a lake using the D-Pad to navigate, the "A"
            button for acceleration and the "B" button for reverse. The "Y" button is used to enter the fishing screen.
            There is also a fish finder on the lower part of the screen that helps the player in locating a good place
            to fish.

            When the player enters the "fishing screen", they can use the "L &amp; R" shoulder buttons to increase the
            distance meter, the "X" button brings up the lure selection screen, the "B" button can bring an overhead
            view of the location the player currently has the lure set for and the "Y" button brings the player back to
            the "boat mode". To cast, the player presses the "A" button once to start the cast meter and a pressing it
            again when the meter is set at a certain limit to cast it.

            While fishing, the player will have an overhead top-down mode of the lake, using the "A" button to reel in
            their lure and using the D-Pad to manipulate movement of the lure. Fish can be seen through the water,
            outlined in a light color while bigger fish are seen stationary and cast in a dark shadow. Once the player
            hooks the fish, a meter will show up at the bottom, showing the tension of the line, when it hits to the far
            right of the meter, the line will snap. The line can also be manually cut by pressing the "A+B" buttons
            together.

            There are eight different lures to choose from (Pencil Bait, Torpedo, Jitterbug, Frog, Crankbait, Spoon,
            Furry Sinker &amp; Plastic Worm) along with several different color variations to choose from and five fish
            to catch (Blue Gill, Rainbow Trout, Catfish, Northern Pike and the game's namesake, Bass).

            There are also attributes the player can have, Technique and Strength, that can be upgraded by catching more
            bass and progress can be kept through a password feature.</story>

            Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.

            But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes
            that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of
            these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.

            Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up
            with each criminal, they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may
            encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a
            missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for
            every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is
            empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.

            When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time
            remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you
            to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed

            Esmeralda, this time captured by a new villain, the horrible Halfenpounder. You must run, jump, and eat
            fruit (can malnutrition cause a hunched back? Can nutrition reverse it?) through a varied series of platform
            environments, jumping over (and atop) rolling logs that will briefly daze you if you mistime your jump and
            spiked pits that will, well, skewer you as surely as in the original, swinging on ropes, and signaling the
            end of each level by ringing an enormous bell there specifically for that purpose. Since our pal Quasi is
            from Paris, not Krypton, and doesn't grow large eating mushrooms, one must conclude that it is the amusing
            idle animations and hidden bonus stages that lend the "Super" prefix to this game.</story>

            they are penguins, in some they are elves), and has turned many of Santa's helpers into his own twisted and
            dangerous assistants. James Pond is recruited to infiltrate Santa's grotto, free the captive penguins,
            retrieve the stolen toys for the children of the world, and defeat Dr. Maybe once and for all. This time,
            however, due to the greater risks involved in this mission, Pond is given a robotic suit and the code name
            "RoboCod" (a pun on RoboCop). This suit gives Pond superhuman strength and agility as well as enabling him
            to stretch his midsection almost indefinitely and reach otherwise impossibly high areas.</story>

            English teams), European League (16 European teams) and International cup (eight team tournament). Training
            allows to practice free kicks, penalties or to pass, shoot and dribble without opposition.
            Players can compete head to head, or play cooperatively against the computer in the same team. Other game
            options include player speed, wind and grass cut, along the typical half length, offside rules, extra time
            and difficulty setting. All changes, from team edits to options, are stored in the cartridge internal
            memory.

            About the game itself, it was one of the most popular of the time, featuring a top-down view with the ball

        <story>The very first installment of the Super Robot Taisen series is quite different from all of its
            successors; most notably, the robots are treated as sentient organisms, and all pilots are absent from the
            game. As the intro tells, they live on the planet of super robots, when a mysterious space creature know as
            Gil Gil Gan takes control of most the planet's inhabitants and launch a destructive war.

            The basic interface is like every other SRT game: your robots are placed out on a map grid with different
            terrain types. Placing the cursor above a robot and pushing a button brings up a menu with basic choices for
            movement, attack, status and special options. A similar menu is displayed if you move your robot close to an
            enemy unit, offering options to attack, use spiritual powers or negotiate. After all robots have moved, the
            turn is over, and the game switches to the enemy phase.

            All robots are licensed from two parties only ? Sunrise and Dynamic ? and when starting the game you may
            choose to start with the Gundam team, the Mazinger team or the Getter Robo team. One robot must be
            designated as the team leader, which allows you to upgrade its statistics with a number of points. If the
            leader robot is destroyed in battle, the game is over. Unlike later games, destroyed units are not repaired
            after a scenario is cleared, but may show up as an enemy unit later on. This puts a lot more emphasis on the
            negotiation command than later games, since a lot more enemy units may in fact turn out to be friends. Few
            of them will listen unless you have first brought down their HP to a minimal amount, though.

            Apart from HP, each unit has XP. Experience is gained for each enemy unit that is destroyed, and a level up
            adds to all aspects of your robot; speed, force, armor, HP and SP. SP, or spiritual power, is like MP in
            conventional RPGs, allowing a unit-specific set of ?spiritual commands? to be executed. These usually change
            game variables, such as force of attack, speed of dodging or health. Health is otherwise regenerated by
            putting a unit in one of the bases spread out on each map. When first entering a base, you gain a power-up
            item. These are fitted to your robots between scenarios and include new weapons and shields.

            Each battle is displayed as a small animation, but it is all very primitive compared to later games in the
            series, even on the Game Boy, with little movement apart from the bullets and lasers. Preceding each battle
            you have initiated yourself, you may choose your weapon. Weapons may be hand-to-hand or ranged. Ranged
            weapons are advantageous since your opponent may not fire back ? this is true even of enemy units which
            possess ranged weapons of their own. All weapons have also properties for their accuracy and power, which
            are altered according to the terrain and whether enemies are at sea, on the ground or airborne.</story>

            to serve the human resistance.

            Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is
            continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has
            limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and
            coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

            T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The
            first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a
            post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy
            supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah
            Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From
            there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

            Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up
            digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also

        <story>Taiyou no Tenshi Marlowe: Ohanabatake wa Dai-Panic! (Sunshine Angel Marlowe: Panic in Bloomland!) is a
            weird game. It's essentially a puzzle game that's hard to categorize.

            Despite being released only in Japan, the game is fully playable for non-Japanese speakers. The only thing
            you would be missing is the brief story, but there is a fan translation patch for anyone curious about the
            game.

            The game consists of eight areas which you can beat in any order to unlock the final areas. Each area has a
            total of five stages that need to be beaten before you can clear the area and move onto the next one. Every
            area features a unique theme with cutesy graphics of enemies that are also surprisingly well animated for a
            GB game. The goal of each stage is to make all the flowers bloom while avoiding enemies and preventing them
            from destroying your work.</story>

        <story>An egg arrives from a far-off planet in outer space. This egg contains a 'Tamagotchi', a baby alien that
            cannot fend for itself, and requires your attention and care. Look after the Tamagotchi and help it grow up.

            Tamagotchi is a game based on the popular virtual pet of the same name. In it, you select an egg from the
            laboratory, and then it hatches in its room. From there, you are fully responsible for its care. Everything
            from feeding, medicine, playing with it, cleaning up its poo and scolding or praising it when appropriate -
            you must do it all.

            Unlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy version is not in realtime - you can adjust the Tamagotchi's
            growth speed in the game options. You can also look after up to three Tamagotchis simultaneously. The Game
            Boy version also features three different games to play with your pet - depending on the game you select, it
            will improve their mood, their intelligence, or their physical fitness. The three games are:

            Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right. Try to guess which direction it will face next.
            Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study. Simple math questions will appear and you must help it answer them.
            Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit. Baseballs will rain down from the sky. Get your pet to them before
            they hit the floor to score a point.

            Another feature exclusive to the Game Boy version are Tournaments. You can enter your pet in Race, Beauty
            and Knowledge tournaments. You can increase your chances of winning in these by training your pet, but make
            sure that when you enter them that it's not sick or spoiled, as it will not perform as well as it could. Win
            a tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in the Hall of Fame.</story>

        <story>According to African legend, a human baby was abandoned in the forest. Found and brought up by a she-ape
            named Kala, he grew to learn the ways of the jungle and the language of the beasts. Years later, as John
            Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was brought back to England to claim his rightful inheritance. However, he
            occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle.

            Now is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, but
            their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan into
            retrieving the seven gemstones that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are believed to be
            the Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been given three days to find
            the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, Sheeta the Panther.

            After consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been scattered
            around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating dark caves,
            crevasses, swamps, and treacherous quicksand.

            Objects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. Throughout the
            quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are encountered. If Tarzan
            comes into contact with any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour and the on-screen timer shrinks
            accordingly. Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him to escape them.

            If Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones within the time limit and deliver them to Usanga, Jane will be
            released. If not, she will become nothing more than another bowl of jungle soup.</story>

            A single-screen platformer, you guide a man with a hat from platform to platform. Since he can't jump by

            standard platformer in which the player crosses the 16 levels, jumps over gaps and dodges enemies.

            However, the unique feature of the cartoon Taz was converted to the game: his ability to spin. This allows
            him to reach high acceleration and being invulnerable - but every second takes away a part of the associated
            energy bar.

            It can be refilled by picking up one of the power ups on the way. Every level has to be solved within a time

            computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in
            action or coach mode. There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for
            official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license.

            The play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally. Player graphics are large and
            colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team. Animated cut-scenes are
            shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.

            There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of
            the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver
            progression from the top to the bottom of the screen. Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive
            play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap. A
            very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.

            There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature
            allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.</story>

            A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which
            can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially

            opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

            The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a
            timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of

        <story>In this version of Tetris, the basic 'clear the line of puzzle blocks' element is still here, but with an
            added twist: inside the many block shapes are bombs. By linking the bombs while clearing the play field as
            usual (creating a line of blocks), more of the field is cleared as the bombs explode.

            The usual gameplay modes are included, i.e. challenge, clear as many lines as possible, time trial, clear as
            many lines as possible before time runs out and 2 player battle.</story>

            a race of bunny-like beings. The flower grows on the holy mountain known as Mount Dubious. However, one day
            the old Shabubu is attacked and the Maita Flower is stolen. Trip World becomes disarranged and its
            inhabitants don't stop quarreling with each other. But there is one hope in the form of the old Shabubu's
            grandson, Yacopu (also spelled Yakopoo).

            The player controls Yacopu through five stages in this side-scrolling platformer. The young Shabubu's
            trademark ability is to shapeshift into different forms. In his normal form, he is able to walk and jump as
            well as to kick enemies, Yacopu's primary way of attacking. Unlike in many other platformers, many of the
            enemies don't harm you on contact and push your character around instead. However, certain foes might attack
            you after you damaged them, while others do so from the beginning.

            At almost any time, the player can change to the flying or fish form. Flying Yacopu is able to reach places
            he wouldn't otherwise be able to, while the fishy hero is best suited for underwater areas. You also come
            across power-ups that temporarily give your character new powers, such as stunning enemies with seeds,
            bouncing around as a ball, or attacking with an extended tail. Beneath the mountain, settings in the game

            different power ups that Wario can find. The Bull Hat lets him plough through bricks in a single hit, ram
            his horns into the ceiling to hold onto it, and butt stomp to stun all enemies. The Jet Hat allows him to
            fly horizontally for a short period of time, and increases his jump height and speed. Finally, the Dragon
            Hat allows him to breathe a long stream of fire for a short period of time.

            To suit Wario's greedy nature, the game revolves around money. Throughout the stages, you can earn coins by
            grabbing them floating in the air, punching them out of bricks, or by body slamming into foes and then
            collecting the coins they drop. You can also find hidden treasures buried deep within some levels by finding
            a key and then throwing it at the skull door to unlock it. Once Wario reaches the end of a level, he usually
            needs to pay a toll to get the end-of-level door to open. Pressing Up on the Control Pad and B pulls out a
            coin worth 10 coins, which you must throw at the door. Once the door opens, you can exit and the level is
            complete. Before you finish each level, you can choose to play a mini-game that doubles or halves the amount
            of coins you have, with a 50/50 chance. You get three tries, and can choose to leave whenever you wish...so
            don't get too greedy!</story>

            from the Black Sugar Gang of Kitchen Island sneak into Wario's newly built castle, steal back the treasure,

            what you now call your own.

            In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when
            hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn
            into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats
            up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types,
            like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise

        <story>WCW: The Main Event is a professional wrestling video game released in 1994 by FCI for the Nintendo Game
            Boy portable video game system. It was just the second video game based on World Championship Wrestling, and
            the first of two released to a handheld console.

            Gameplay

            There are two types of matches available: a set number of falls (best of one, three, or five) and a set time
            limit (five, ten, or fifteen minutes). Each wrestler has his unique special move along with punch,
            clothesline, bodyslam, suplex, dropkick, and cross body block. One can choose between a single match and an
            elimination match which runs the gauntlet of the remaining wrestlers.
            Throwing one's opponent out of the ring is possible, as is fighting outside of the ring. There is no
            ten-count while both wrestlers are outside of the ring, but one will start after one enters.
            [edit]Wrestlers

            These wrestlers used in the game were considered to be the top-ranked superstars of the WCW as of 1993. They
            were Rick Rude, Ron Simmons, Steve Austin, Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, Big Van Vader and former
            tag team duo The Steiner Brothers (who had left for the WWF but still appeared in the game anyway).</story>

        <story>Wheel of Fortune is based on the popular game show produced by Merv Griffin. The goal is the same as the
            game show, which is to guess missing letters to solve a puzzle which covers the same subjects as found on
            the show, such as place, person, thing, phrase, etc. Like the game show, the players spin the wheel, select
            consonants, buy vowels and hopefully, solve the mystery phrase. The wheel can be "spun" at different
            strengths by sliding a bar across a selector, and the chances of earning a free spin, losing a turn, and
            going bankrupt remain.

            Game play is for up to two players taking turns, or for one player against the computer. Gameplay moves
            through three rounds, and a bonus round for a grand prize. Winning is accomplished, essentially, by earning
            the most money and winning the game by solving the phrases.

            There is even a "sexy model" that animates out onto the "stage"--though the resemblance to Vanna White is
            minimal at best.</story>

        <story>World Bowling is a bowling game in which the player has to beat bowling alleys from six different
            countries (England, China, Japan, Canada, France, USA). To win the game, all alleys have to be beaten in a
            row with an increasing points requirement (200 to 250) - if the score is missed once, it is back to the
            beginning.

            The player can set the weight of the bowling ball: a heavier ball has more power but this goes in turn with
            a loss of control. It also depends on the chosen player character: the male is better with heavy balls while
            the female character should use a lighter one. The throw itself is divided into three parts: character
            position on the alley, control and power. While the first is simply chosen by lining the character up, the
            latter two are reaction games: a marker goes from left to right (and vice versa) and the player has to hit
            the button when the marker reaches the desired point. A high value (i.e. the marker is right) in control
            means that the throw is straight while a high power determines the speed and strength.</story>

        <story>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others
            on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a
            worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

            Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can
            crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a
            great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it
            dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and
            then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.

            There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind
            settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities
            such as ropes and girders.

            There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with
            affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</story>
