    <story>3D MahJongg is a new take on the old game of Mahjong Solitaire (a.k.a. Shanghai Solitaire). It uses the same
      set of 144 tiles. The object of the game is simple; find two matching tiles that are not blocked by other tiles on
      either side (up and down is not an option), and slowly whittle away at the layout till all of the tiles have been
      removed. While simple in practice, the possibilities are endless.

      The game has two sets of rules, Rivers and Classic. In Rivers, tiles must be on the same layer, and the line
      connecting them may not change direction more than twice. In Classic, tiles must not be covered by other tiles,
      and must be free to their left or right side.

      The game has two modes: Free Play and Adventure mode which has 200 combinations of the available options you must
      solve completely before moving forward. There is no basic "save" feature, but rather you create a profile, and if
      you turn off the 3DS it will start you at the next level to be completed when you return to Adventure mode.

      The layout is viewed on the touch screen and the 3D screen. You chose your matching tiles (or the option to rewind
      or fast forward your moves) on the touch screen, and a 3D representation of the layout is seen on the upper
      screen.

      The layouts are represented in 3D and with 50 different types, along with six different animated 3D backgrounds
      called "Scenes", as well as six different touch screen backgrounds, and six different tile sets which includes sea
      creatures, zombies, fantasy characters and traditional playing cards. Like many puzzle games with multiple
      options, you have to unlock the additional layouts, scenes, backgrounds and tile sets, which is done through
      Adventure mode.</story>

      disappearances and strange events, players will interview colorful Ooo inhabitants, dispatch evil doers in

      goods to construct a Garbage Princess, our heroes embark on a fantastical adventure and teach him a lesson!

      hacerlo tocando botones o con el stylus. En el caso del stylus no hay que trazar la dirección, sino tocar en la
      división correspondiente que veamos en la pantalla. Por su lado, el control con botones funciona de la siguiente
      manera: L simboliza a la izquierda, R a la derecha y L + R a la dirección arriba. En base a las pulsaciones que

      small village populated by animals. Gameplay consists of improving the village with new buildings and decorations,
      collecting furniture and items for one's house, and donating fossils, fish, insects and art to the local museum.

      Several features in the game make their series debut here, while others have been brought back from older Animal
      Crossing games after having not been seen in the DS or Wii entries. These include public works projects, which
      allow new landmarks and buildings to be added to the town, as well as altering the appearance of certain major
      buildings; the Dream Suite, which allows players to visit other towns in a single-player session; a tropical
      island that hosts minigames and multiplayer interactions; Re-Tail, a store that acts as a flea market and allows
      the player to customize certain furniture items with alternate color schemes or patterns; and QR code sharing for
      player-made clothing and patterns.

      A free update, titled Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo, was released in late 2016. This patch added
      amiibo functionality, including 64 villagers only available through the use of a corresponding card or figure. 50
      of these are villagers who had previously only appeared in the GameCube and/or Nintendo 64 installments of the
      series; the other 14 are tie-in villagers that represent characters from The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, Monster
      Hunter, and Hello Kitty. Other features include new items and currency, an RV campground near the outskirts of
      town, minigames and features from Animal Crossing spin-off titles, and several miscellaneous features intended for
      the player's convenience.</story>

    <story>"Under the sea, under the sea! Darling, it's better down where it's...cough...cough!" Life under the sea was
      good but then an oil tanker spilled thousands of gallons of crude oil. Help save the fish!

      Atlantic Quest is a match three game. You have three match options to select from. There is the "swap two items to
      create a straight line of three or more" style. There is the chain style where you click and drag your mouse along
      a line of three or more of the same items, and there is the click on a group of three or more of the same items
      style. You can swap between styles at any time by selecting it at the bottom. There are fish trapped in green oil
      bubbles. Below these are blue bubbles with a picture of an item from the board. To release the fish, match the
      item in the blue bubble. Also on the board are green oil tiles. Make matches over these to clear them. To clear a
      level, clear all green tiles and free all fish.

      As the game progresses, you will have bonus items, like a bomb that clears some squares and obstacles, like a
      stone that keeps items from dropping. To clear the stone, make a match next to it. Later, you also have pearls
      that, if you get them to the bottom of the board, give you a bonus extra. These pearls are:
      Orange: The clownfish: Removes the item and tile from one square, anywhere on the board.
      Green: The octopus: Shuffles the board.
      Blue: The shark: Randomly removes items and green tiles from the board. Only removes items where there are green
      tiles.

    <story>When you awaken in a mysterious prison you have no idea how you got there or why. Your great-uncle Titus will
      offer assistance from beyond in freeing you and himself from the puzzles of Azada. Find the pages of the book and
      you'll both be free.


      Azada is a multi-puzzle adventure game where you must solve a bevy of different types of puzzles in order to
      collect painting fragments that will unlock the final puzzles to escape the room. The sorts of puzzles you will
      have to deal with range from many typical puzzle mini-games such as; a match game where you have to match
      different butterflies, a symbol-sudoku game, a sequence following game where you must remember the sequence of
      musical tones played, picture-puzzles where you'll have to use sliders, a game where you'll have to place arrows
      on the ground in order to lead a robot to the exit, a game played against the AI where you'll try and complete
      squares while taking turns laying down lines, a match-stick moving game where you'll have to reduce a number of
      boxes, mazes, math puzzles and even a tower of Hanoi game.


      The most unique puzzles of the game however are the ones that play similarly to graphic-adventure point-and-click
      games. You'll be given a stationary picture of a room with three or four objects to find in it. When you find
      these objects you will use them to uncover the pages of the Azada book in order to move to the next puzzle. For
      example you will need a pipe segment which you'll need to attach to a pipe you uncover while opening a cupboard
      and then when the pipe drains a number combination will fall out which you'll enter into a lock-keypad and so on
      and so forth.


      There are over forty different puzzles and puzzles make re-appearances as you play along the game and will get
      more challenging as you encounter them further along. For example the aforementioned Towers of Hanoi will
      gradually go from four discs to transfer over to seven discs. There are five master-level puzzle challenges to
      move through which are actually the pages of the Azada book where the forty+ puzzles are contained.</story>

    <story>Brain Age is back with all-new devilishly difficult brain-training exercises designed by world-famous brain
      researcher Dr. Ryuta Kawashima. The modern mind has numerous devices to stay connected (e.g. laptops, smart
      phones, tablets), and these distractions have led to an information overload making it difficult to stay focused
      on specific tasks. Brain Age: Concentration Training offers newly designed training exercises to combat this
      information addiction. By spending at least five minutes a day, these exercises will challenge players with
      activities to help improve their concentration skills and the ability to access their short term memory. The new
      Devilish Training exercises dynamically increase or decrease in difficulty based on your real-time results to help
      consistently train players at the limit of their abilities. Beyond the Devilish Training, there are additional new
      and classic puzzles for every purpose, whether to challenge one's concentration or math skills or provide
      relaxation activities to give the brain a break.</story>

    <story>Code of Princess is a side-scrolling hack-n-slash RPG from the director of Guardian Heroes. As Tetsuhiko
      Kikuchi's influence is heavy here, the game is, in some ways, like a spiritual successor to the aforementioned
      Saturn title.

      Code of Princess follows a typically "anime" plot about a princess whose kingdom is being overrun by monsters, and
      a motley crew of characters that meet and join together to overthrow the evil monsters and the reason the monsters
      are there. Primary focus is on the character Solange as she wields a massive sword known as the deLuxcalibur,
      which is a sacred artifact of sorts for her kingdom. She is joined by several other characters, most of whom are
      playable in the story mode of the game.

      Each stage is a fairly straight-forward side-scrolling affair more focused on intense combat than any amount of
      exploration. Each character uses the same basic controls, but all are played very differently. Many combat moves
      are performed in a style similar to a fighting game, such as pressing down, towards, and the A or B button.
      Players may typically move between 2-4 planes of action on the stage moving forward or back in the 3D space, and
      doing so is often part of the strategy of moving through levels. Typically, a note at the top of the screen will
      give the current objective for the level or individual wave during the level, such as "defeat all enemies,"
      "defeat the boss" (which makes the other enemies more of a distraction), "save a villager," or even simply to
      survive for a set period of time.

      Since levels and missions tend not be be very long they are very numerous and players will find themselves
      leveling up frequently. Each level allows the player to assign skill points (generally 5 points) to any of six
      attributes: Vitality (life), Piety (maximum magic), Attack, Defense, Mind (magic strength), and Speed. Various
      status effects may affect the player throughout the game as well including burning, shock, stone, dark (draining
      magic), or poison.

      Each main story character not only plays differently, but they level up independently of one another, so that
      players may choose customize each character differently. For instance, Solange is naturally a bit slow, but fairly
      powerful, so a player may build on these strengths adding new speed and ramping up her strength even more. The
      character Ali is already pretty fast, so players may want to customize based on that, while other characters are
      more magic-based, or various combinations of strength, magic, speed, etc.

      Besides the regular story missions, there is a Free Play mode that allows players to replay any story mission
      without lengthy cut scenes or dialog, and there are Bonus missions which unlock parallel to the Story. Often, they
      operate as elements to deepen the overall story experience through the gameplay, or simply to add new twists that
      aren't part of the main story, such as fighting a boss a second time after the boss has, essentially received a
      "second wind" and called in some support. Bonus Missions also tend to be more challenging, with many of them
      greatly exceeding the difficulty of the regular story missions, leaving these to be "pro" challenges or challenges
      for those players willing to replay missions enough to level up several times more.

      During combat, players may lock-on to a single enemy, which allows the player to deal heavier damage to said
      enemy. On top of this, activating a Burst gradually drains the magic meter, but also increases all attacks on
      every enemy. Combining this with a lock-on allows a player to deal massive damage with every attack. There is also
      a shop where players may buy better weapons, armor, and the like--though it is fairly small compared to a
      traditional RPG.

      Finally, the game also uses the Nintendo Network for local and online co-op and versus play, complete with
      leaderboards. This mode also allows players to use more than just the main eight main protagonist
      characters--practically every single enemy character in the game can be unlocked to be used in this mode, from the
      simplest soldier characters to massive dragons and even boss characters.</story>

    <story>For twenty years, Attera has been under attack from monsters spawning from anomalies called Dusk Circles. To
      fight those monsters, people with the Star God Brand, called Disciples, are gathered and trained in a school in
      Fort City. The Dusk Circles are said to appear because of mankind's desires. Eight such circles forming the
      Pandora Labyrinth are known to exist: the original one, which is still inactive, and one for each of the seven
      deadly sins. The Disciples formed at the Academy are the first line of defense against the monsters, but they
      cannot enter the labyrinth since the energy inside nullifies their Star Power.

      The player takes on the role of a new male Disciple whose name may be entered manually or chosen at random. On the
      day he arrives at the Academy, he meets with two other newcomers, Fuuko and Chlotz, whom he saves from a stray
      monster. Once at the Academy, they are to be assigned a rank, to know if they are standard Disciples or elite, and
      have their Ether count measured. All three are found to be elites, Fuuko is even an S rank, the highest possible
      rank. The protagonist is only A rank, but his Ether count is off the charts. That high amount of Ether (tens of
      times the average) makes him a special Disciple called God's Gift. This will enable him to create an Ether field
      which allows him to enter the Dusk Circles and make it possible for other Disciples to accompany him and use Star
      Energy inside.

      Like its predecessor, Conception II is divided in two parts: the city and academy, and the dungeons. The player
      moves to the different areas in the city by choosing them on a list. Each area as its own purpose: the dorm is
      where the player edits the party and manages the save data, the church is where new units are created, and the
      Academy is where most events occur. To create Star Children, the hero must perform a ritual known as classmating
      with one of the seven heroines. Classmating requires BP, which is gained in bonding events and by meeting certain
      conditions in battle. As the hero's Ether and an heroine's Star Energy are combined inside a device called a
      Matryoshka womb (Matryoshka with various effects are acquired as the game progresses), Star Children of various
      classes are born. Each Star Child is either male or female and has his or her own abilities. The strength and
      maximum level of a Star Child is influenced by the bond (mood and intimacy) the hero has with the selected
      heroine. That bond, displayed by a smiley icon that looks happier or angrier depending on the girl's current mood,
      changes through events in the Academy, in which the player chooses different dialogues that will influence his
      relationship with the girls. Some of these events make use of the touch screen. Only three bonding events can be
      played at a time, but the numbers of remaining events, shown by three hearts on the top left corner, is refilled
      when time passes by exploring a labyrinth or resting in the dorm. The story normally progresses only when the
      corresponding icon is selected at the Academy, but some events may be required for this icon to be available.

      In the dungeons, the player explores a randomized labyrinth with a party of up to four units: the hero and one of
      the heroines form the main unit, and three groups of three Star Children may accompany them. The enemies are
      displayed by icons that change depending on the foe's strength; the weakest enemies can be defeated without
      fighting. In battle, the units act in turn and are placed either in front, behind or on one of the sides of an
      enemy. Each enemy has a weak spot, a direction from which more damage is dealt. Attacking from dangerous spots
      (they have the word "Caution" identifying them when the enemy is about to perform a strong attack) fills the chain
      gauge; when the gauge fills enough, the monster's turn gets delayed. Another aspect of battles is the Ether level:
      depending what actions are performed, this level will rise or lower. Higher Ether means that the party will be
      stronger. Once a labyrinth is cleared, a more difficult version can be access from the training station, and
      quests such as defeating certain monsters or finding a specific item can be taken at the lab to be completed by
      revisiting the dungeons.

      As with many dating simulation games, Conception II has multiple endings depending on the different relationships
      developed throughout the game.</story>

    <story>A package arrives at your doorstep. Inside is a little green creature called Omnom, it's cute and loves
      candy!

      Cut the Rope is a physics puzzle game. Each levels contains a piece of candy, hung up in one or more ropes. Slice
      the rope with the touchscreen and gravity causes it to fall down. The candy interacts with other contraptions on
      the stage, such as bubbles that lift it and new ropes that can catch the candy when falling. But you must watch
      out for spikes and other dangerous elements to avoid, as well as falling out at the bottom of the screen. The goal
      is to move the candy to your buddy Omnom to feed him.

      The levels are divided in "boxes". Each level contains three bonus stars that you can grab by simply touching a
      star with your candy. The levels select screen shows an overview of the levels you have beaten and how many stars
      you've gotten. To unlock new level packages you need to obtain a certain number of stars. To get a highscore you
      also want to be as fast as possible, as a time bonus is added to your score when you complete a level.

      The initial release had a hundred levels in four boxes: cardboard box, fabric box, foil box and gift box. Later
      updates added cosmic box with gravity reversal buttons, valentine box (released around valentines day 2011) with
      halve candy parts that must be joined together, magic box with magic hats that can teleport the candy, toy box box
      with platforms that make the candy bounce, tools box with saws that can be turned by the player, and buzz box with
      bees that hold ropes and move at a certain pattern. Even further updates (version 2.0 and above) split the whole
      game in three season and added more boxes: DJ box with gramophone records that can be turned by the player in
      DJ-fashion, spooky box with ghost that can be changed into different in-game objects by the player, steam box with
      controllable blasts of steam, and lantern box which allows for controlled teleportation of candy. Another addition
      is a number of Omnom's drawings that are hidden in the backgrounds of the levels.</story>

      Gameplay follows the traditional Ace Attorney style, with a few new features. Like in Professor Layton VS Phoenix
      Wright: Ace Attorney, cross-examinations can sometimes involve multiple witnesses. Courtroom sessions are now held
      in front of juries, who are empowered to stop proceedings and issue a verdict at any time. Luckily, Ry?nosuke is

    <story>Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultimate Mission is a card-based fighting game that is a portable-port of the arcade game
      Dragon Ball Heroes. It was released in Japan for the Nintendo 3DS handheld gaming console on February 28, 2013.
      Its sequel, Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultimate Mission 2, was released in 2014.

      The game recreates the interface of the Dragon Ball Heroes arcade game via the touch panel. The player assembles a
      deck of five cards for battles. As the player uses the touch stylus to create a card formation on the bottom
      screen, the battle unfolds on the top screen. Actions, such as the Charge Impact, are done so that the player can
      intuitively do them with their hands on the portable device.

      The game includes a scouter function, which uses the 3DS' camera to take a picture of someone's face in order to
      check their power. This allows the player to earn Zeni and other items. Scan someone with a high power level and
      Great Ape Vegeta will appear as a boss fight, and tag up with friends to take him on. Scanning special QR codes
      allows the player to fight special bosses, such as Beerus or Super Saiyan God Goku from the 2013 movie Dragon Ball
      Z: Battle of Gods.

      In the story mode, the player moves around what is called the Ultimate Map and experiences the story from the
      Saiyan Saga up through Dragon Ball GT, with the most famous scenes from the series recreated for the game. By
      completing missions, more cards are obtained in the game.</story>

    <story>The court jester Dhoulmagus of the kingdom of Trodain stole a powerful magical scepter sealed beneath the
      royal castle. Using the power of the scepter, Dhoulmagus destroyed the castle, placed a curse upon the kingdom and
      its people, and turned King Trode into a troll and the princess into a horse. A sole surviving castle guard
      journeys with the king, the princess, a reformed bandit named Yangus and a few other companions in search of the
      evil jester and a way to break the curse.

      Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game with random enemy
      encounters, simple turn-based combat mechanics, and management of a party consisting of four characters, each
      belonging to a clearly defined class. Unlike its predecessors in the series and most Japanese RPGs in general, the
      game features a continuous world with fairly vast landscapes and integrated towns and dungeons, as opposed to
      world map traveling and locations represented by icons. The game features full camera rotation and optional
      first-person view. Like in the previous Dragon Quest games, many objects can be interacted with; for example,
      barrels can be physically lifted, carried, and broken, to reveal items hidden within.

      In addition to experience points, the player receives skill points from battles, which can be manually allocated
      into a skill category of the player's choice. These categories include three different kinds of weapons,
      fisticuffs, and a discipline unique to each character. After a required amount of skill points has been invested
      into a particular category, the correspondent character learns a new ability or becomes more proficient with the
      chosen weapon. The Alchemy Pot system allows players to gather recipes and mix items to create new ones.

      The international version of the game features several updates to the original Japanese version, including voice
      acting, graphic menu, symphonic soundtracks, and flashier effects.</story>

      of adventure about the "Hero." Players will experience the grand beautiful world of Lotozetasia made possible only
      by PlayStation®4. So get ready to confront realistic monsters on the field as if they are really alive. With the
      concepts of "nostalgia" and "making anew," DRAGON QUEST XI (the 11th adventure) will provide a "new starting
      point" for the series!
      And the Hero is being called as a child of the devil. On the day of his 16th birthday, the protagonist headed to
      the God's Rock with his childhood friend Emma for the traditional coming-of-age ceremony in their village. He then
      learns the truth that he is actually the reincarnation of the "Hero." So what should the "Hero" do? In order to
      search for an answer the Hero will set out on a journey into an unknown world away from his hometown. However,
      what awaits the young hero is not a warm welcome from the people, but rather a fate of being chased and called as

    <story>Put on your boots and get your 3DS now its time to play your favorite career-simulation on your portable
      console! The Nintendo 3DS is a groundbreaking hardware that brings 3D gaming to the handheld market for the first
      time. The 3DS utilizes a 3D slider functionality and an improved top LCD display to present a glasses-free 3D
      effect in compatible games, while giving players the option to moderate the effect as they see fit.

      This technology now allows you to work a 1 km wide scenery with acres, roads, your house and farm as well as a
      small village, with the vehicles found in your generous fleet all three dimensional in the Farming Simulator 2012
      3D. Take a seat at the wheel of authentic farm machines by renowned manufacturers like DEUTZ-FAHR, KRONE, HORSCH,
      POeTTINGER, AMAZONE, LEMKEN and VOGEL &amp; NOOT and get started: plow and grub your fields, seed one out of three
      plants (corn, rape and wheat) and fertilize them to accelerate the growth. For your motivation, you will be able
      to sell the harvest and invest it into new equipment. As known from the "Farming Simulator-series, you will be
      supported by digital assistants, who take over the work you assign them to. That way you will be able to
      efficiently organize your farm and maximize your profit.

      The Farming Simulator and the Nintendo 3DS console are a great match: Experience a high quality 3D-graphic which
      supports the 3D-effect of the console perfectly. You will be able to explore an open world, play with a
      day-night-cycle and chose a free-to-play mode on your way to become a successful farmer. The game addresses both
      kids and male adults and hence makes it a great expansion of the Nintendo 3DS family.</story>

      farm in a little town. Unexpectedly, Tom helps breathe new life into the run-down farm and even save it from a
      greedy developer.

      Farmscapes is a puzzle/simulation game with a bit of an adventure storyline, similar in gameplay to other Playrix
      Entertainment games, such as Gardenscapes and the Fishdom series. Virtual money won in puzzle levels is spent on
      renovating the farm. Exactly like in Gardenscapes, there are always three kinds of an object (for example shed,
      dog kennel, lanterns, gazebo...) to choose from and after four objects are bought, the next four appear. However,
      virtual money is won through match-3 levels, like in Fishdom. The game also contains hidden object levels, but
      they don't yield money and are rather used to push the story forward. Another kind of gameplay found are short
      object puzzles in the farm view itself, similar to point-and-click games. The game also has its system of
      achievements, related both to storyline and to puzzle gameplay. All achievements can be viewed as trophies in

    <story>3-ch?me no Arino is the third game based on the popular Japanese television show Game Center CX (a.k.a. Retro
      Game Master). Arino has been sent back to the 1980s and has lost his memory, remembering only his love of classic
      video games. The only way to recover and return to his own time is by playing video games and completing
      challenges. And of course, you're there to help him a little -- or in other words, play everything for him while
      he sits and comments on how you're playing.

      The story mode is broken into chapters -- one for each featured game -- where the player can wander around the
      small town and speak with various characters, who are all based on and voiced by cast or guests from the TV show.
      Each of the featured games is a brand new "faux-retro" game made to look like an old 8- or 16-bit video game, from
      a wide variety of genres including maze games, platformers, shooters, and even a full-fledged RPG. There are also
      a number of side games including Game &amp; Watch-style LCD games, marble labyrinth games, and even the 10-yen
      medal games commonly featured on the show's arcade trip segments, for a total of over 15 games.

      In addition to the story mode, there is also a free mode where any unlocked game can be freely played, an ad-hod
      multiplayer mode for the games that support it, and a dictionary mode where famous quotes and terms from the TV
      show are explained.</story>

      what it takes to clear his clients of their guilt?

      Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney is the fourth game in the Ace Attorney series, and the first to be designed from the

      gets to take part in forensic investigation, such as taking plaster casts and dusting for prints. Players can also
      examine their inventory in three dimensions, as clues can sometimes be hidden out of normal sight.

      Apollo also has a special talent - the ability to perceive people's nervous habits. If a witness' testimony
      appears to be rock solid, Apollo can still crack it by taking note of their nervous habit that they perform
      whenever they're lying, and catch them in the act by shouting out "GOTCHA!".</story>

    <story>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies is the fifth installment in the main Ace Attorney series,
      focusing on the staff of the Wright Anything Agency as they take on a series of cases in the "dark age of the
      law," where corruption, false charges, and falsification of evidence are rampant in the legal system. Dual
      Destinies features the return of series protagonist Phoenix Wright as a practicing lawyer and playable character,
      having regained his attorney's badge after the events of Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney. Apollo Justice also returns
      in this installment as a playable character. The men are joined at the agency by Athena Cykes, a rookie lawyer
      with a personal connection to a few of the cases in the game.

      Like previous games in the series, gameplay in Dual Destinies is broken up into two distinct segments:
      investigation and trial. In the investigation phase, the player navigates through a series of screens, searching
      for clues and interviewing witnesses. Items and other pertinent information found are added to the court record
      for use during the trial phase. In the trial phase, witnesses take the stand, and the player is given the
      opportunity to present evidence that contradicts their testimony. Dual Destinies also features the return of two
      additional gameplay mechanics introduced earlier in the series: the "Psyche-Lock," where witnesses during the
      investigation phase refuse to divulge information, forcing the player to present evidence to get them to talk; and
      the "Perceive System" in the trial phase, where the player looks for non-verbal tells that a witness is hiding
      something. The addition of Athena as a playable character introduces the "Mood Matrix," where Athena is capable of
      scanning the emotions of a witness to locate the parts of their testimony that cause them the most distress or
      where their mood contradicts what they're saying.

      Dual Destinies features five cases, with the three protagonists trading off lead defense responsibilities while
      the other attorneys act as assistants and guides. Players face off against a new prosecutor character, Simon
      Blackquill, as well as returning series regular Miles Edgeworth. Like previous Ace Attorney installments, the
      order of the cases is not in strict chronological order, with the first case actually taking place timeline-wise
      in the middle of the fourth case, serving as a tutorial to ease new players into the gameplay.

      Unlike its predecessors, Dual Destinies did not receive a physical release in Western territories. Two DLC cases
      were also released, "Turnabout Reclaimed" and "Quiz Turnabout Deduction." Only the former has been made available
      outside of Japan.</story>

    <story>The handheld adaptations of Happy Feet Two (based on the 2011 animated musical film sequel of the same name)
      put players in the role as Mumble the penguin who goes on a quest to rescue the penguin nation in the wake of a
      new threat to the Antarctic.

      These versions take a simplistic platform side-view approach where you must help Mumble reach the end of each
      level, using his famed tap-dancing abilities along the way. Throughout the levels are several pickups including
      musical notes (which add towards the player's final rank for these levels), as well as Pebbles that will
      eventually grant you additional dances to carry out later in the adventure.

      Mumble will also need the help of 3 new baby penguins on his journey: Bo (who uses her double-jump and wall-jump
      to reach heights), Atticus (who can destroy ice that Mumble is unable to with his beat-box ability) and Erik
      (Mumble's son who can float horizontally for a brief time, as well as crossing over unstable ice platforms).

      As well as the platforming levels with Mumble, players also take the roles of Will the Krill (who is also on an
      adventure to become the best underwater predator) and Sven the puffin (who players must pilot in a variety of
      flight levels).

      The DS and 3DS versions both include an Extras Menu (filled with Will the Krill's levels, Sven's levels, an Art
      Gallery and even a Music Player).</story>

    <story>Harvest Moon: Skytree Village is the third independent Harvest Moon developed by Natsume since the company
      began developing the series separately from the original Bokujou Monogatari(????) series developed in Japan (see
      here for explanation), with the first installment being The Lost Valley for 3DS and the second being Seeds of
      Memories for mobile/Wii U. It has many returning features from the previous Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley, such as
      the ability to sculpt and shape the terrain on farmland, but unlike The Lost Valley, there is a fully fledged town
      that is usually available in most Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons games. To veterans of the series, all the familiar
      features are there as well; the ability to woo and marry from a myriad of potential marriage candidates, exploring
      the wilderness, and of course, the farming itself! The "Save the Harvest Goddess/Restore the Land" theme that is
      featured in many of the previous entries to the series returns as well, so farmers better grab their hoes and get
      back down to earth!

      Features

      Build up your own farm from scratch
      Sculpt the land to truly make your farm your own
      Grow crops and raise animals
      Fall in love, and get married with 3 bachelors/bachelorettes each to choose from
      Save the Harvest Goddess and restore the land, one crop at a time

    <story>Long ago the towns of Bluebell and Konohana were friendly neighbors, joined together by a tunnel underneath
      the mountain that separates the towns. Eventually the towns started to disagree with each other on whose town had
      the best cooking cuisine. As the villagers became more obnoxious with each other, the Harvest Goddess became more
      annoyed with them. One day she finally put her foot down and collapsed the tunnel between the towns, cutting them
      off from each other. Now the only interaction the towns have with each other is at their cooking festival, where
      their cooking conflict continues four times per season.

      As a new farmer, you are eager to start your new life at one of the towns but a freak travel accident makes you to
      forget what town you originally were going to live in! Listen to each mayor's story, hear about each town, and
      then decide where you want to start your new farm life.</story>

      used as fuel for the ship, and thus, needed for escaping.

      In Hey! Pikmin, a spinoff of the Pikmin series, the player controls Captain Olimar, in a 2.5D side-scroller with
      puzzle elements, instead of the traditional 3D real-time strategy that the series goes by.

      Pikmin are found in the wild, and Captain Olimar can call upon them with his whistle, and then issue several
      different commands, such as throw them onto platforms, so they can remove obstacles and collect items. Olimar is
      controlled with the D-pad, while Pikmin are controlled with the stylus. As such, the game relies heavily on the
      touchscreen.
      Each Pikmin type has different abilities ? for instance, blue Pikmin can swim, red Pikmin are resistant to fire,
      and yellow Pikmin are resistant to electricity. The player must then utilize different Pikmin to suit different
      situations.

      Captain Olimar has a set of green bars depicting his health, which are depleted by simply bumping into enemies,
      instead of just by enemy attacks, like in previous games.</story>

    <story>A Tale of Life, Love, and Friendship!

      Hometown Story takes you to a lush, green village tucked away in the countryside. The shop you inherited has
      brought you back to your hometown. However, the shop has become run down, and no one wants to even window shop
      there anymore. Can you turn the shop around and even expand it, or is it destined to stay in the red forever?

      You won't have to go it alone, though. You'll get help from a magical sprite named Pochica, who will help you get
      the store back up and running, and introduce you to all of the unique characters who reside in the town. The
      villagers will all change and grow throughout the game, and that person who you thought might be up to no good
      when you first met them just might have a heart of gold! Your experiences will be completely different from anyone
      else's. You'll never know what to expect in Hometown Story!</story>

    <story>Based on the 2012 Sony Pictures Animation movie, Hotel Transylvania puts players as the role of Mavis
      (teenage daughter of Count Dracula), who must embark on a quest to save her new friend Johnny from the evil master
      chef Quasimodo (who plans to make him the soup de jour for Mavis' 118th birthday party).

      The gameplay for both DS and 3DS versions takes a simplistic side-scrolling platform approach where players must
      guide Mavis throughout the hotel, defeating a myriad of monsters along the way.

      Mavis can also talk to several characters within the hotel to carry out several missions in order to reach
      Johnny's location. The control pad (and Circle Pad for 3DS) for both consoles control Mavis' movement, while B
      allows her to jump and holding A allows her to walk.

      The A button is also used to interact with the several characters and numerous objects with the hotel. Mavis will
      eventually unlock special moves (such as the Trance Stare, which freezes monsters in their tracks) as the game
      progresses, allowing her to move further.

      Both versions also contain an Extras menu, containing 10 bonus levels and several concept artworks from the film
      to unlock throughout the game.</story>

      potential to dramatically alter the course of a match. In terms of the storyline, both Inazuma Eleven 3: Lightning
      Bolt and Inazuma Eleven 3: Bomb Blast adopt the point of view of a different character, each version having
      different powerful rivals to take on.

      Bringing back the unique formula of RPG elements combined with football-based action, this time around you can get
      further immersed in the game with the series debuting in 3D, making the special moves and battle scenes even more
      intense. New features on the pitch include the ability to roll out special tactical team plays which involve the
      whole team, as well as a goal shoot chaining system where you can string together special moves from different
      teammates to launch powerful attacks on goal.

      Off the pitch, to hunt down the best of the best, a new method for scouting players via a capsule vending machine
      has been introduced, giving you new tools to find the perfect players for your line-up!

      Get ready to take to the playing field once again and challenge the rest of the world in the Frontier

    <story>Goal! Dive in to Inazuma Eleven 3: Team Ogre Attacks!, an exciting blend of RPG action and football exclusive
      to Nintendo 3DS!

      Lace up those boots and get ready to take to the field in Inazuma Eleven 3: Team Ogre Attacks! on Nintendo 3DS
      family systems! This time, Mark Evans and the rest of the Inazuma National team face the tall order of reigning
      supreme in the Frontier International Championships and they also have to deal with a futuristic enemy that has
      travelled back in time to threaten the very existence of football!

      80 years in the future, Mark Evans great-grandson Canon Evans encounters Team Ogre, who plan to travel back 80
      years and defeat Inazuma National on the football field to change the course of history, which in their evil minds
      means creating a world without football! In order to foil these potentially devastating plans, Canon must come
      face to face with Mark so that they can work together to preserve the fate of the beautiful game, all while
      ensuring that Inazuma National remains on course to be crowned the greatest football team in the world.

      Inazuma Eleven 3: Team Ogre Attacks! joins Inazuma Eleven 3: Bomb Blast and Inazuma Eleven 3: Lightning Bolt as
      part of the Inazuma Eleven 3 series, each playing out the same storyline from the viewpoint of a different
      character with distinctive rivals. Team Ogre Attacks! contains over 2,000 characters to encounter and recruit, and
      over 350 special moves to pull off that have the potential to dramatically alter the course of a match, including
      players and a number of special moves exclusive to this version. Bolster the strength of your squad by using Ogre
      Premium Link to connect with Inazuma Eleven 3: Lightning Bolt or Inazuma Eleven 3: Bomb Blast and scout special
      players and receive items not available through normal gameplay.

      Success on the field means maximising the skills of each player in a starting line-up, with the ability to roll
      out special tactical team plays that involve the whole team, and a shot chaining system where players can combine
      special moves from different teammates to launch devastating attacks on goal. After all, Mark Evans and friends
      will need to perfect all the moves at their disposal in order to defeat Team Ogre and go for glory!

      Encounter a futuristic enemy looking to eradicate football from the course of history and take to the pitch
      alongside Canon Evans, the great-grandson of Mark Evans in Inazuma Eleven 3: Team Ogre Attacks!, only on Nintendo
      3DS family systems!</story>

    <story>Travel through time to save football in Inazuma Eleven GO Chrono Stones: Thunderflash on Nintendo 3DS and
      2DS!

      Fight for the future of football in Inazuma Eleven GO Chrono Stones: Thunderflash and Inazuma Eleven GO Chrono
      Stones: Wildfire on Nintendo 3DS and 2DS, as the Raimon Jr. High team dives into a time-bending RPG, where new
      armourfied Fighting Spirits, new characters, and new footballing adventures await!

      Just three months after the events of Inazuma Eleven GO, Arion Sherwind returns to Raimon Jr. High to discover a
      baseball field where the football pitch once was. Worse still, there is no sign of the club, while students
      quietly enjoy other activities, like gymnastics, music and calligraphy its as if football never existed! With the
      arrival of some mysterious time travellers from 200 years in the future, it becomes clear that Arion is the only
      one who can save the beautiful game! And thats where things kick off, as you travel through time to explore a huge
      game world, uncover secret plots, battle rival teams to prove your prowess, and restore football to glory!

      First things first, though: youll need to choose between two jam-packed editions: Wildfire and Thunderflash. The
      main story is the same in each, but there are unique scenarios, characters, equipment and more that youll only
      find in each version. Which will you pick?

      Once youve chosen, your next task is to form the best team you can. As you play five-a-side Battles against rival
      squads, youll sometimes get requests to join your team from members of the losing side. Or you could hunt down
      PalPack Cards from dealers, which show player stats, and anything else required to recruit each of them. With over
      a thousand potential teammates, you wont be short on choice but youll only be able to recruit a limited number,
      and there are just 16 slots in your team. Choose wisely!

      Its all about winning football games though, and there are two flavours: Battle and Match. Battles are small,
      five-a-side challenges that last just a minute, which you win by completing a certain task, like scoring first.
      Matches are longer affairs, with 11 players on each side, substitutes, a full-size pitch, and ten minutes of
      action. In either type, use the stylus to move your player up the pitch, marking, passing and dribbling with a
      tap. When you meet another player, choose which direction to go and you might even dodge them!

      Tasty footwork will get you so far, but Special Moves are the real spice of the Inazuma series and this new season
      is no exception! Each member of your team can have up to six over-the-top, anime-style moves that could turn the
      tide of a match plus, Fighting Spirits return to supercharge your stats, offering even more powerful Special
      Moves. On top of that, the new Miximax feature is introduced, which lets you blend player Auras to enhance their
      abilities. And this time around, armourfied Fighting Spirits can be worn for even more powerful abilities and
      Special Moves!

      Between games, youll be chasing the ghosts of former friends through time and space, to get the Raimon Jr. High
      School football team back together. You wont be alone, though, as the secretive Fei Rune turns up to help you
      fight the future. On your travels youll unravel the story by chatting to the locals, train hard to strengthen your
      players abilities, and hunt down lost Auras to reignite the team!

      As well as the main story, theres lots more to enjoy: take on up to three mates in Local Play, including
      two-on-two matches, and trade players discovered in Story Mode. Go online to download new items and characters via
      SpotPass, and activate StreetPass to receive team data from other users, then play matches against their teams.
      Watch out for more characters and items to download from launch, too!

      With an eye on the future and your feet in the past, youll need to be a supreme captain to build the best team,
      and restore order in epic football RPG, Inazuma Eleven GO Chrono Stones: Thunderflash and Inazuma Eleven GO Chrono
      Stones: Wildfire, only on Nintendo 3DS and 2DS!

      -Recruit a top-tier football team from over a thousand players, in a time-warping RPG adventure
      -Command over-the-top Special Moves and new armourfied Fighting Spirits to win five-a-side and full-on matches

    <story>Summon up your fighting spirit as Raimon Jr. High takes to the pitch again! New footie stars, new moves and a
      whole new adventures kicking off in Inazuma Eleven GO: Light and Inazuma Eleven GO: Shadow on Nintendo 3DS family
      systems!

      Ten years after Inazuma Eleven 3, newbie Arion Sherwind is putting on his Raimon High soccer kit. Its his first
      day, and hes revved up to be joining the schools famous football club. But after a weird kid appears on the pitch,
      Arion works out the club is going to be closed down by a shady company called Fifth Sector, the big bosses in
      charge of youth football. Time to lace up!

      Before you even think about going near a ball, youve got to make a choice between two editions, Light and Shadow.
      The core content is the same, but there are unique characters, techniques and teams (among other things) to each.
      Which one will you choose?

      After you join the school football club, youll need to recruit a team - and a good one wont be enough. There are
      two ways to shape your squad: first, you could thrash another team in a five-a-side Battle, and get a request to
      join from an opposition player. You could also buy some PalPack Cards from dealers. Think of them as brochures for
      new players, complete with stats and sign-up requirements. As you play more and more, you can potentially meet
      over a thousand players, but you only get 16 slots for your team, and just 110 for the entire roster, so pick
      carefully!

      When the time comes to kick off, youll find two match types. The first one is an 11-man game that lasts ten
      minutes, while the other is a surprise, five-a-side bash that gives you a single minute to achieve a specific job,
      like scoring a goal. You play by using the stylus to move your player up the pitch, then tap to kick, pass or mark
      opponents. When you tackle, everything pauses so you can size up your opponent, then use various statistics to
      plan your play - dodge or tackle.

      Special Moves are back, as well. These give each of your players up to six, super-powered, anime-style tricks,
      which you get during the story or whenever certain players level up. Even better are the brand new Fighting
      Spirits, which increase players statistics and allow for ever more powerful Special Moves to help you get the edge
      over the opposing team.

      When youre not on the pitch, you can explore the local area, check things out, and talk to people to get the
      lowdown on school life. Later on, youll be able to go to visit Inazuma town and stop off at places like the
      Shopping Area or the Royal Academy. It all looks gorgeous in full 3D, too!

      Saving the Raimon Jr. High from Fifth Sector is only part of the package, as theres a stack of other challenges to
      tackle. Test your skills against up to three friends in Local Play, including two-on-two matches, or trade players
      during Story Mode. You can get new characters and items via SpotPass, or use StreetPass to receive other players'
      team data and play matches against them.

      So, if youre a football fan and reckon youve got what it takes to put together the very best team from over a
      thousand players, sign up with Inazuma Eleven GO: Light or Inazuma Eleven GO: Shadow today - game on!

      -Go on an exciting adventure, as new heroes attempt to save youth football from a strange organisation
      -Recruit and trade the ultimate football team from over a thousand potential players, each with unique stats
      -Utilise powerful Special Moves and new Fighting Spirits to tip the game in your favour

    <story>Cradle of Rome 2 is the sequel to Cradle of Rome. Just like its predecessor it is a puzzle game played on a
      board filled with different items. The objective is to remove all items on blue tiles on the board. This is done
      by creating a match of three tiles or more with an identical item, horizontally or vertically. Matches with
      default tiles fill up the board immediately again as everything drops down. To get rid of the blue ones, they must
      be put into a match. The level is won when all blue tiles are removed before the time runs out.

      The main Adventure mode consists of 100 levels through 5 epochs with increasing difficulty and new tiles appearing
      further in game. During the game the player earns resources that can be used in-between levels to turn a small
      village into an empire. Blueprints for new buildings are earned through a matching pairs mini-game. The game's
      visuals consist of hand painted graphics. There are also two unlockable modes (Blitz and Tourney) and 15 extra
      levels after the main mode has been finished with all rewards.

      For the free browser version the Blitz and Tourney modes are not available.</story>

    <story>Luna, a college student studying horticultural magic, returns home to Nevernear and discovers everything in
      ruins. Her friends and family have been frozen inside mysterious black crystals, and all of the beautiful
      buildings and castles are in shambles. Only by finding and planting the seeds of magical plants can she find out
      what happened to everyone and attempt to restore the city.

      Jewel Match 3 is the first in the series to incorporate a full story. It features many elements from its
      predecessors, but also has improved graphics and dynamic visual effects and sounds.

      After the introduction, choose the type of game to play from three selections. Normal (timed) and Relaxed
      (untimed) are built around the adventure storyline, while Match3 Maniac skips the story and lets players dive
      right into "match 3" timed levels.

      In all games there are several objectives. All of the tiles with a gold background must be cleared, and all of the
      magical items must be collected. Obstacles include tiles with chains, wood, and silver "unpolished" surfaces, some
      of which must be matched two or more times. Most levels consist of multiple rooms as well, and all of those rooms
      must be completed. Collect a red key, for instance, to unlock an area in a different room locked with red blocks.
      Some magical items and keys are hidden underneath other tiles.

      Tools to help with tile matching and removal come in the form of eight magical spells which are introduced
      gradually and have three strengths. To use the spells, fill Luna's mana bar by collecting green bottles from the
      puzzle levels. The destructive hammer, like in other Jewel Match games, also has three power levels. Match four or
      more tiles to receive a multi-color flower tile which matches any of the jewels. Matching five or more gains a
      gold arrow-shaped "helix" row blaster.

      The adventure games (Normal and Relaxed) have features in addition to an evolving story. There are hidden object
      and jigsaw puzzle mini-games, a shop where in-game coins can be spent, and the rebuilding of castles which can be
      saved as desktop wallpapers when completed.

      The game has 100 levels. It is possible to finish an adventure game in less than that number. If that happens, the
      player is given bonus levels so that all 100 can be played.</story>

    <story>One of the most beloved franchises in Nintendos long history makes its glorious return in spectacular 3D! Pit
      of Kid Icarus fame is back in a new game designed specifically for the Nintendo 3DS system, by Masahiro Sakurai,
      creator of the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, and his development team at Project Sora.

      Kid Icarus: Uprising is a fast-paced and action-packed blend of aerial and ground-based shooting built on
      elegantly intuitive and streamlined play control. This follow-up to the original Kid Icarus released for the
      Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987 has been at the top of gamers wish lists for years.

      Boasting gameplay that is easy to pick up but incredibly deep, the game is sure to satisfy novice gamers as well
      as fans who have been clamouring for a new installment in the franchise.

      The hero, Pit, teams up with Palutena, the goddess of light, who bestows on him the miracle of flight for limited
      stretches. With this gift, Pit soars through the skies, shooting down swarms of enemies, then alights and engages
      in frantic ground-based battles against Medusas underworld army.

      Find and collect numerous weapons and items that offer bonuses and ability boosts. Players can choose weapons
      before they send Pit into battle, giving them countless layers of strategies in each level.

      Players can choose between a basic Blade, basic Claws and a basic Orbitar weapon. Blades are well-balanced, Claws
      have limited reach but increase running speed and the Orbitars can shoot two shots that grow in power over
      distance.</story>

    <story>With the threat of the evil Xehanort's return, King Mickey and Yen Sid have begun preparations to combat him.
      Their first step is to turn Keyblade wielders Sora and Riku into Keyblade Masters. Sora and Riku are given the
      task of completing the Mark of Mastery exam which when completed will help them obtain a great power to aid in the
      fight against Xehanort. This test will not be so easy as the two must venture together into seven Sleeping Worlds
      and find the the Keyholes of Sleep to awaken them. Along the way they meet new friends and face new enemies in
      worlds completely new to them. These challenges will forever test their abilities and lead to an ultimate test to
      prevent the darkness from overtaken their light.

      Dream Drop Distance takes place immediately after the events of Kingdom Hearts II. Sora learns from a letter he
      receives from King Mickey that he is the only one who can save those lost who are connected to him; referring to
      the characters Ventus, Aqua, and Terra from Birth by Sleep. Sora and Riku travel to worlds based on settings from
      various Disney properties such as La Cité des Cloches (The Hunchback of Notre Dame), Prankster's Paradise
      (Pinnochio), Symphony of Sorcery (Fantasia) and The Grid (Tron).

      The game utilizes a gameplay mechanic called Flowmotion which allows your character to quickly bounce off walls
      and scale buildings in short bursts of speed. A Drop system has been implemented which changes the control of your
      character to either Sora or Riku after a certain amount of time. While playing as Sora/Riku and the Drop Gauge
      reaches 0, your character will switch to the other who can be in an entirely different world at a completely
      different time. The game is an action-RPG with gameplay similar to Birth by Sleep in which it uses the Command
      Deck system. The Command Deck lets you create your own customized deck of actions such as items and spells for
      quick use. Dream Eaters are introduced as new enemies. Some of these Dream Eaters known as Spirits can be
      recruited and further enhance your abilities in-game by strengthening your powers and giving you new attacks.

      introduced in this title is Robobot Armor, a mech suit with copy abilities similar to Kirby's own. The Robobot
      Armor is much more powerful than Kirby and can interact with obstacles that he may not be able to pass on his own,
      but its large size sometimes means Kirby will need to exit the suit and proceed on foot. In addition to the mech
      gameplay, Kirby has access to three copy abilities that are new to the series: Doctor, Poison, and ESP. All copy
      abilities can be accessed at will by scanning in compatible amiibos, including alternate costumes that can only be
      obtained through figures made specifically for this game.

      Alternate modes include Team Kirby Clash, an action RPG that supports up to 4 players; Kirby 3D Rumble, in which
      Kirby moves around an arena to defeat enemies as fast as possible while aiming for a high score; Meta Knightmare
      Returns, a speed-oriented mode in which the player controls Meta Knight through modified versions of the levels
      from story mode; and the Arena and True Arena modes that return from other platformers in the series.</story>

    <story>The plot of Kirby's Epic Yarn largely revolves around Nintendo's cutesy cream-puff being dragged out of his
      normal world by an evil sorcerer named Yin-Yarn and trapped in a fabric-based world called Patch Land. Everything
      in this new land, including the heroic marshmallow Kirby, is made of yarn and fabric. As a result, Kirby has lost
      his signature inhalation and power absorption abilities. After meeting and saving Fluff, a prince, Kirby and his
      companion decide to work together to "stitch-up" Patch Land in the wake of the destruction caused by Yin-Yarn.

      Kirby's Epic Yarn follows previous Nintendo franchises Paper Mario and Yoshi's Story in its creative design around
      physical real-life aesthetics. Where Mario was designed around a flat paper theme, and Yoshi lived though a living
      story-book (in a sense, a variation on a paper theme), Kirby ventures into strange new territory being made of
      fabric and yarn. Stages and puzzles are heavily designed around the fabric themes and aesthetics, such as enemies
      being made out of yarn, and puzzle elements involving zippers and buttons.

      As mentioned, Kirby has lost his typical powers, and instead of using his formidable lungs as a weapon, he uses a
      whip (obviously) made of yarn. While Kirby no longer swallows enemies to steal their powers, he hasn't slowed in
      the least bit where transformation and unique powers are concerned. Kirby floats by transforming into a parachute,
      flies as a UFO, drives as a car, and features a wide range of other transformations including an anvil, a dolphin,
      a mole, a dune buggy, a rocket, a robot, musical notes, and more.

      Like the Lego games or later Wario Land titles, Kirby really doesn't die. However, taking damage causes Kirby to
      lose precious items (colored beads for instance) that the player collects throughout the levels to, in effect,
      earn higher scores, medals, and to unlock more challenges in the game. As well as the item collection, each stage
      contains three hidden secrets for players to hunt. Each "world" in the game features a boss battle and extra
      stages should the player meet the right challenges in item collection. There are also new friends to be made who
      bring about several smaller challenges such as finding a certain number of characters in a stage within a time
      limit, carrying a character to a new location, and more.

      Also, Kirby's Epic Yarn follows the seemingly current trend from Nintendo of the game playing largely as an
      old-school side-scrolling title a la New Super Mario Bros. Wii, large segments of Metroid: Other M, and the
      revamped Donkey Kong Country Returns.

      Kirby also welcomes his new pal, Fluff, in two-player cooperative gameplay which adds to the puzzle solving and
      gameplay in many situations. Like many Nintendo-helmed Wii games, Kirby's Epic Yarn takes liberties with the Wii
      Remote using it for several different styles of play holding the Remote sideways à la classic controllers,
      pointing at the screen, or angling the controller for other uses.

      The 2019 Nintendo 3DS version further expands the gameplay with amiibo compatibility, new abilities, mini-games
      and the new hard mode ("Devilish Mode"). The Devilish Mode, which can be chosen at the beginning of each level
      gives Kirby health (which he doesn't have on the standard mode) and makes a demonic little yarn monster follow
      Kirby around and drop bombs on him, fire arrows at him, or just try to hit him with a quick dash.</story>

    <story>Kokuga is a slow-moving, free-scrolling top-down shooter where players are placed in control of a futuristic
      "compact mobile tank" known as Kokuga. The Kokuga is suspended on four "legs" and features a single turret capable
      of rotating 360 degrees using the shoulder buttons.

      Each stage has the player move through destroying other mechanical, tank-like, turret-like, and robotic enemies.
      Most stages end with massive and varied boss battles. Stages are separated into segments with large gates at the
      dividers--destroying all enemies before destroying the divider resorts in bonus shield repairs. Destroying the
      gate without defeating all the enemies in that section merely results in all enemies therein being annihilated.

      Kokuga differentiates itself from most other shooters in a variety of ways. Rather than collecting power-ups,
      players already have 20 "cards" to utilize. Of these 20 attack and support cards, four are randomly displayed on
      the touch-screen at a time and offer a variety of abilities, from an offensive laser ring around the player, to
      homing shots, to shield restoration and damage repairs. Players cannot cycle through the cards, and in order to
      get new ones, at least one current card must be used. In this way, the game offers an unusual strategy element to
      the shooter gameplay--careful and planned use of power-up cards over simply powering up as much as possible as
      soon as possible.

      Also different is the level set-up. There are three "final" stages at the corners of a triangular grid which make
      up the final stages. The stages themselves are laid out somewhat like a keyboard labeled with letters A~L, and a
      player may start at any stage. However, continuing through the game requires a player to select an adjacent stage
      from the completed first.

      A final "game ending" stage can only be played once an adjacent stage has been completed. In this way, players may
      play for as long or as short as they wish. With games encompassing several stages, or just a couple. This longer
      game option even allows players to replay a completed stage--but it will automatically be at a higher difficulty.
      In this way, a player's game could be as short as two stages (a regular and a final) or as long as 37 (all regular
      three times, and one final).

      In a vain similar to the dark, nigh-genocidal story behind titles like Ikaruga, the story here is a bleak
      melodrama focused on ethnic rivalries and the incomprehensible nature of humans. The similarity is likely due to
      the game sharing the same director (Hiroshi Iuchi) as Ikaruga. No actual countries are named, rather, they are
      listed by letters with "Country A" and "Country I." The story is played out in largely text-based cut-scenes with
      dark background imagery. The text itself carries a militaristic flavor to it, further adding to the melodrama of
      the story.</story>

    <story>Two worlds collide in an all-new adventure set in the world of Super NES classic The Legend of Zelda: A Link
      to the Past. In this newly spun tale, Link transforms into a living painting to cross into a dark, parallel
      dimension mirroring Hyrule. Conquer the puzzles, traps, and hidden rooms of deadly dungeons to save both worlds
      from certain doom!

      Brought to life in 3D, this beloved, top-down world is the perfect backdrop for a sweeping new tale. Dungeons sink
      deep below the screen as Link and his attacks pop out, highlighting the nonstop action. The pace is faster than
      ever, especially since you can swap items on the Nintendo 3DS touch screen. Shoot an arrow, toss a boomerang, bomb
      a wall, then merge into a painting to slide between two worlds - all in a matter of seconds. With gameplay,
      visuals, and controls this smooth and consistent, no Zelda adventure has ever been so action-packed.</story>

    <story>Following in the footsteps of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D, Majora's Mask 3D is an enhanced remake
      of the Nintendo 64 game The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. It keeps the same story as the original: while riding
      Epona through the Lost Woods in search of an invaluable lost friend, Link is ambushed by a Skull Kid and two
      fairies, who steal Epona and the Ocarina of Time. Upon catching up with them, Skull Kid turns Link into a Deku
      Scrub and flees, but one of the fairies, Tatl, is left behind and starts traveling with Link. Emerging in a new
      realm called Termina, Link is informed by the Happy Mask Salesman that Skull Kid has stolen a precious mask from
      him, the evil and powerful Majora's Mask. Link then learns that the moon is falling onto Termina's central city,
      Clock Town, and he only has three days to stop it.

      Aside from graphical upgrades, some story and quest related features are reordered, removed, or expanded, and a
      few new features are added, such as two Fishing Holes, one near Southern Swamp and another at Zora Cape. Boss
      fights are also altered, with new weak points added in the form of a large eye resembling those on Majora's Mask.
      Using the old strategies won't work this time. Saving is also different. Playing the Song of Time to return to the
      Dawn of the First Day no longer automatically saves the game. Instead, the game must be saved at Owl Statues,
      which no longer force the player to suspend gameplay, or Quill Statues, which can save the game, but can't be
      warped to.</story>

    <story>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 for handheld and mobile platforms is similar to the game on consoles. It adapts
      the last four films of the Harry Potter series into the LEGO game format. Compared to the console version, it has
      fewer and smaller levels with different puzzles and less playable characters.

      The story of the films is retold in 14 chapters (compared to the 24 chapters of the console version). A lot of the
      same cutscenes of the console version are re-used. Gameplay follows the standard template of the LEGO series:
      players move through the levels, picking up collectibles, solving puzzles and defeating occasional enemies.
      Different characters have different abilities which must be used in combination to overcome the challenges. Only
      wizards and witches can use magic spells like Wingardium Leviosa (for levitating objects) or Stupefy (for stunning
      enemies). Other skills include super strength (for pulling open doors) or the control of a pet (which can dig in
      the ground to discover secrets). Once completed in Story Mode, levels become available for Free Play, which allows
      using unlocked or bought characters for replaying the levels, discovering any remaining secrets through their
      special abilities.</story>

    <story>An exciting new strategy RPG with a unique "bowling" battle system to blast enemies into others for massive
      combos!

      Residing on the outskirts of town as the proprietor of a quiet, rustic inn, Luchs has lived through much of his
      life proudly clinging to a code of honor passed down from father to son: "When our cherished guests finally
      arrive, think of them as nothing less than family."

      Unfortunately, the inn has not yet had even a single guest since its foundation, leaving Luchs no choice but to
      excavate and sell crystals - a valuable fuel source - in order to make ends meet. It is during one such routine
      excavation that he happens upon a beautiful maiden encased inside a massive crystal, and her abrupt awakening
      triggers a series of unexpected events that include foul fiends, astonishing abilities, and miraculous
      mysteriesâ€¦</story>

    <story>Luigi's Mansion pits you as Luigi, Mario's forgotten brother.

      Luigi, while checking his mail, found out he won a mansion in a contest. What's weird, is he never entered any
      contest to begin with. Being the curious person he is, he calls up his brother, Mario, and asks to meet him at the
      house.

      Luigi sets forth through a dark and scary jungle to find the house, but sees that Mario is nowhere to be found.
      Puzzled, Luigi enters the mansion, only to encounter ghosts. He meets up with a scientist, Professor E. Gadd, who
      explains the situation and hands over the Poltergust 3000. Luigi must now make his way through the mansion's many
      rooms, sucking up as many ghosts as he can.

      As you explore, you must solve mysteries, collect cash/gems/jewels/coins, and encounter boss characters. Luigi's
      vacuum has the ability to suck up ghosts that have inhabited this strange mansion. However, the ghosts will not
      give up so easily. You must struggle with them and pull them back to catch your prey with your trusty vacuum. As
      you continue to your goal, you must face off with the deceased denizens of the house and the boos that haunt it,
      and unlock new rooms with the keys you find along the way. You can also gain special abilities for your vacuum,
      such as the ability to shoot fire, water, or ice. Remember though, treasure is scattered everywhere. Check all the
      objects for coins and paper money, and who knows, you may just make enough money for Luigi to buy a mansion of his
      own...

      As you explore the strange mansion, the plot slowly unravels and it becomes apparent that something more sinister
      is going on in that haunted house. Will you ever see your lost brother Mario again?</story>

    <story>After the happenings of Luigi's Mansion, Luigi once again has to put on his ghostbusting gear. This time he
      visits Evershade Valley, where the destruction of the Dark Moon caused all ghosts to become hostile to humans.
      Luigi is hired by the eccentric professor Gadd to visit five haunted mansions to retrieve the Dark Moon parts.

      Luigi's weapon of choice is vacuum device called PolterGust 5000 which is used to fight against the numerous ghost
      enemies. The basic procedure is always the same: Luigi has to stun the ghosts with the flashlight (in contrast to
      the predecessor, now the position and angle is important) so he can vacuum them in. Of course the ghosts struggle
      against it, so their movement has to be countered with the analogue stick. There are different kinds of enemies
      which require a variation of tactics, e.g. some ghosts have sunglasses which have to be removed first and others
      are only vulnerable briefly. There are also multi-stage bossfights.

      The PolterGust 5000 is also used to solve puzzles, for example by sucking in a stove and using the flames to
      ignite something else. It is also a good idea to use the vacuum device on physical objects in the mansions in
      order to find secret passages or treasure. When Luigi picks up enough treasure, the PolterGust 5000 is
      automatically upgraded.

      Besides the campaign, there is also a multiplayer mode which takes place in the ScareScraper, mansion with 25
      floors. The available modes are hunter (sucking in as many ghosts as possible in a limited amount of time), rush
      (finding the exit in a limited amount of time; clocks can be picked up to extend the time limit) and polterpup
      (tracking down polterpulps, invisible ghosts, with the flashlight).</story>

    <story>In Luxor, you journey through Egypt while battling Set to help Isis save the land.

      A level in Luxor consists of a pyramid and a long path. On this path, scarabs, Set's minions, are moving long
      groups of different colored spheres toward the pyramid. Your mission is to hinder those scarabs from completing
      their task. For this purpose, you have a winged sphere shooter with which you fire your own spheres into the
      queues of the moving scarabs.

      When you create a group of 3 spheres of the same color, they vanish. As soon as all spheres of a scarab are
      removed, you have destroyed this minion. Either when you destroy one of Set's minions, or you take too long to
      destroy it, another minion with lots of new spheres enters the screen, heading for the pyramid. Once you have
      destroyed all spheres in a level, you proceed to the next one. But when a scarab's spheres reach into the pyramid,
      you have lost a life.

      The game offers 88 levels, which are spread over 12 stages throughout ancient Egypt. When you progress through the
      levels, you will start with just one pyramid, but this will change over time, and you must play against two (or
      even more) scarab groups simultaneously.

      To help you, and make the game more interesting, there are plenty of power-ups available, like fireballs and
      lightning bolts for destroying multiple spheres, stopping, slowing down, and reversing the movement of all enemy
      scarabs for a few seconds, precision shots (with an aiming help), and some others.</story>

    <story>MapleStory: The Girlâ€™s Fate is the first title from the franchise to be released on the 3DS and represents
      a big step forward for the series. It sees you take control of a young girl who has a mysterious spirit trapped
      inside her and the only way for her to be rid of it is to head out on an adventure!

      The game will retain its simplistic look and playing style, with characters drawn up as sprites and everything
      being controlled by a single button. In keeping with the RPG genre you'll be able to customise your character by
      selecting her weapon speciality and giving her a specific skill set.

      Surprisingly, MapleStory: The Girlâ€™s Fate is a single player game and doesn't feature any MMO elements. It will
      be hitting South Korean shelves on 25th April; the series is gaining momentum in the West, so we wouldn't rule out
      an eventual localisation completely.</story>

    <story>Mario Party: Star Rush is the latest installment on the Nintendo 3DS following the release of the 2014 3DS
      game Mario Party: Island Tour. The general concept of playing the game is still the same and does not much differ
      from previous iterations of the Mario Party franchise, with one exception. The turn-based gameplay of the previous
      games has been replaced with the ability to move at will, simultaneously, and without set paths on the game board.

      The main game-play mode is Toad Scramble in which the player is represented by Toad, depicted in a different
      color, depending of the amount of players available. In total 10 different game modes are available:
      Toad Scramble: Compete to win the most Stars! Nab Stars by getting 1st place in boss battles and by trading your
      coins at the end of the game. Main game-play mode
      Coinathlon: Play minigames to earn coins as you race around a track! Each coin moves you forward one space. Use
      items to help you reach the finish line first!
      Mario Shuffle: Team Red vs Blue, 3 characters on a simple straight course opposite each other. Winner is the first
      to get their characters on the other side. (Amiibo compatible)
      Balloon Bash:"Classic mode", 10, 20 or 30 turns, and minigames when a player touches a coin balloon.
      Challenge Tower: A single player game where a player must climb a tower with LED spaces while avoiding enemies.
      The higher the better.
      Rhythm Recital: Musical minigame using the touchscreen. Play famous Mario tunes. Each character has instrument.
      Boo?s Block Party: Rotate the blocks, and line up three or more of the same number. Clear a shiny block to clear
      all other blocks of that same color. Try your best to earn a high score! (Endless)/Try your best and play to win!

    <story>Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars is a 2D puzzle game starring Mario and Donkey Kong. The monkey still
      likes to kidnap and the player has to complete levels helping Minis, wind-up toy versions of Mario and other
      characters, while solving puzzles. They walk by themselves and need to be guided to an exit. The player interferes
      by using touch on the GamePad to manipulate the environment. This is done by leading enemies away, covering traps,
      building or removing girders and adding or removing springs. Some levels have a character that needs to be freed
      and guided to safety. Other elements are escalators, conveyors with different directions, free-form building
      blocks, spikes to avoid, hammers to defeat Donkey Kongs blocking paths, toy Donkey Kongs with cannons heads,
      cursed Minis that need to be reclaimed etc. Levels are grouped per eight and each group introduces a new mechanic
      before mixing them up. It no longer uses Pipe Dream-like mechanic from the previous title Mario and Donkey Kong:
      Minis on the Move.

      All levels are played in a small environments. Many only have a limited amount of objects to help the characters
      and in some cases additional elements need to be picked up in the environment before they can be used. This also
      requires removing items when the characters have passed a section. Along the way small coins and a large 'M' coin
      can be collected for additional points or an additional challenge. The characters need to reach the exit together
      and cannot be left behind. Up to three stars can be earned by completing a level.

      The game includes a level editor. In the workshop players can design custom levels and share them through the
      Miiverse. Sharing levels is rewarded with stars. They are also earned by playing custom levels, having your levels
      played, and players can tip each other's creations with stars, which the title references. Levels can only be
      shared if the original creator can fully complete the level collecting all coins and not losing any Minis. Stars
      unlock new elements for the level editor and open up bonus levels.

      It is the first Cross-Buy across the two systems (through an additional download code) and there are only a few
      differences. On the 3DS the game is controlled through touch and displayed on the bottom screen. There is no 3D
      support. The top screen shows the same, but in a smaller box, along with the score, remaining items and the
      remaining time. Through SpotPass and StreetPass players can send and receive custom levels regardless of the
      platform they are created from or played on. Stars and progress are not carried over across platforms.</story>

    <story>October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear
      missiles in Cuba. The world trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer. After days of
      tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the
      resolution of this incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it seemed that humanity had survived
      yet another threat to its existence.

      However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a
      Soviet scientist who had defected to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government agreed
      to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his native land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the
      designer of a nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets are ready to resume its
      development. If this weapon is completed, it will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.

      August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They
      dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of
      Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both
      as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit's modus operandi is to send a
      single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.

      August 24. A lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake.</story>

      the underground caves surrounding your town, to learn more about the world you live in, and eventually become a
      true hunter and help to overthrow the evil that threatens the world.

      The game is a Japanese-style RPG with random encounters and turn-based combat viewed from third-person
      perspective, like in Final Fantasy. You can also pilot various vehicles. You can participate in battles while
      riding those vehicles, performing various special techniques. You also upgrade the vehicles and get equipment for
      them.</story>

    <story>Metroid: Samus Returns is a side-scrolling action-adventure video game developed collaboratively by
      MercurySteam and Nintendo, with the latter also publishing it for the Nintendo 3DS handheld game console. A part
      of the science fiction Metroid series, the game is a reimagining of the 1991 Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of
      Samus, and was released worldwide on 15 September 2017. It follows series protagonist Samus Aran, who is sent by
      the Galactic Federation to exterminate the parasitic Metroids on their home planet of SR388.
      The game features a story and structure similar to Metroid II but with new controls, visuals, and gameplay. It
      also introduces some features that are new to the 2D Metroid games, such as melee counterattacks, an ability to
      fire freely at any angle, and a selection of different abilities. The development on Samus Returns began in 2015,
      with longtime Metroid developer Yoshio Sakamoto producing it. The game was met with positive reception from video
      game journalists, who praised its visuals and improved gameplay over the original game, with many viewing it as a
      return to form for the series.</story>

    <story>Miitopia plays like a classic JRPG, with the main feature in this game being the use of Miis as characters
      populating the world, allowing you to choose from your own Miis for the roles of your playable characters and
      major NPCs, while allowing the use of Spotpass for casting minor NPC roles.
      Besides being able to directly choose which Mii gets each role, the game can also do that automatically.

      A simple job system is in place, giving you the ability to choose a job for each character that joins the party,
      each with their particular strengths and weaknesses. There are the usual jobs in the genre, like warriors,
      clerics, mages, besides more unusual ones, like cats. Equipment is progressively stronger, making it easier to
      improve growth, and food items can also be used to boost character stats.
      The battle system follows the traditional turn-based formula, with only the main character being controlled
      directly, even though there is an option for auto-battle, as well as fast-forwarding.

      One aspect that is different from usual is the use of relationships between characters as a game mechanic, in that
      having a good relationship between two characters will have them help each other out in battle (for instance,
      through the use of healing items).

      Miis can be transferred from the Tomodachi Life game, or from the Miitomo smart-device app.
      The game also supports Amiibo functionality, which provide customization to the Miis.</story>

    <story>Uncle Bob left an inheritance of a small farm consisting of a single hen and one hundred pennies. Now it is
      up to the player to make use of this inheritance and expand the farm. Fortunately, the neighbor Old Farmer Jack
      will help the player in understanding the ropes inf managing the farm.

      My Farm is an livestock raising simulation game. The player using the starting resources must expand the farm by
      obtaining more money by buying livestock, raising and fattening them, and eventually re-selling them or sell their
      produce at the shopkeeper or Penny Fair. The farm allows a maximum of twenty livestock, which may consist of hens,
      ducks, turkey, pigs, sheep, and cows. Each livestock has happiness and food indicator bars which when possible,
      should be kept at a maximum of 100% by regularly feeding and cleaning them.

      The player may also opt to expand the farm by purchasing additional installments which will allow more livestock
      types to be kept without them running away. Fulfilling certain requirements may also unlock additional bonuses
      such as a rooster, a sheepdog, a tractor, and a windmill (see manual for further details). The game may be
      increased in speed to hasten the day/night cycle, allowing the process of produce and fattening to occur almost
      instantly. The game does not have specific target goals. The game does however end if the player only has one
      livestock left which dies either due to starvation or sadness.</story>

    <story>The Mysterious Cities of Gold: Secret Paths is an adventure game based on the 2012 TV series The Mysterious
      Cities of Gold. The game features several key parts from the series: the music, cut-scenes and main characters.
      The game was released in episodic form, as levels were unlocked at the same time when a new episode on the
      television aired. The first five episodes were released for free, the others must be bought.

      The player controls the three main characters Esteban, Zia and Tao. They must escape Zares and his men by solving
      puzzles and overcoming obstacles. Each character has a unique skill and all three must be combined to solve the
      puzzles. Estaban has the ability to unlock mechanisms, where Zia has the option to move through narrow spaces and
      Tao can decipher any language from the allegedly lost continent of Mu.

      The search for the Mysterious Cities of Gold takes the characters through China. The player explores several
      different regions, including the Forbidden City, a lush tropical forest and eventually the Chinese City of Gold.
      For all listed platforms a complete version of the game is available. For iOS there is a full version as well as a
      free version with in-app purchases.</story>

      In this latest videogame action adventure in the long running and celebrated series, Naruto is presented for the
      very first time in 3D, with dynamic camera twists and turns taking full advantage of the new Nintendo handheld's
      hardware capabilities. Naruto is available from the outset as a selectable character, with rival Sasuke
      un-lockable during the course of gameplay. A supporting cast of ten 'assist' characters, three of which can be
      taken along per chapter, offers a different dynamic to gameplay, allowing for a more strategic approach to combat.

      Naruto fans will be able to engage in a bespoke storyline based on the last events of the manga and animation
      series, featuring an all new female ninja character, Malice. The mysterious Five Kages, will also make their first
      videogame appearance in an adventure which spans nine different locations, with secret items and stages aplenty to
      be unlocked along the way.

      Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era on 3DS also incorporates the lead character's 'Sage Mode', in which Naruto
      transforms into a significantly more powerful version of himself once his special gauge is charged to maximum. The
      game will make use of the 3DS' motion controls, in situations such as avoiding certain attacks and during boss

    <story>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a beat 'em up game based on the 2012 television series developed by
      Nickelodeon. The game takes place in New York. The four turtles Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael are
      ambushed by Foot Soldiers. It turns out that the Foot Soldiers created a Mutagen bomb to mutate the whole city.
      The turtles eventually stop this treat, but a sudden call gets them on edge again. April O'Neil has been kidnapped
      by Shredder and he demands Splinter. The turtles fight their way through Foot Soldiers, Kraang, Baxter Stockman
      and his Mousers to be able to defeat Shredder and save April.

      Just like the original games it is a brawler game, but now in 3D. Many sequences use the classic side view, but
      there are also many other perspectives used. Each turtle has a specific attack and the four turtles are always on
      the screen. When not playing in co-op, the other ones are controller by the AI. During the game the turtles have
      to be upgraded. This can be done by collecting points by defeating enemies and breaking items. Health of any of
      the turtles is increased by eating pizza's, sushi and other food items. The collectibles in this game are Mutagen
      Canisters which are used to unlock extras.</story>

      The Oregon Trail is a remake that is loosely based on the educational game of the same name. Whereas the original
      game was a more realistic simulation of the hardships and difficulty of making the Oregon Trail, teaching children
      just how difficult the trip was, the Gameloft version of the game takes a much more "video game" approach with a
      simplified interface and an assortment of mini-games, such as panning for gold, fishing, and a telegraph mini-game
      styled after "Whack-a-Mole".

      At random points on your trip, American political figures talk to you and sometimes challenge you to a race to a
      certain location. There are also educational factoids that pop up during loading screens.</story>

    <story>Ozawa Rina, a touch detective, and her assistant Nameko, are back for the third time on yet another case.
      This time in 3D mode on 3DS instead of NDS as the first two games. The gameplay is mainly the same, the player
      controls Rina character in 3rd-person perspective using point-and-touch interface. Rina can pick up items and add
      them to her inventory, talk to other characters and check various objects in the ares she's in by touching them.
      Collected items can be more closely examined and interacted with, while some can be combined with other items.

      Similar to hint coins in Professor Layton games, this game has name-coins (Japanese "name", not English word
      "name") which are hidden at various spots not visible to the naked eye and will require player to randomly touch
      and check hidden places for such coins. Name-coins too, just as in Professor Layton games are used for hints. Rina
      also carries her info book with her where she adds info about characters she meets.Aside for hints, name-coins can
      also be used in lottery which lets you collect Nameko figurines and completing a full set yields a reward.</story>

    <story>Paddington: Adventures in London is an action game based on the critically-acclaimed 2014 film Paddington
      (which in turn is based on the children's books by Michael Bond).

      The gameplay involves players helping the Peruvian bear complete several missions (some even assigned by the Brown
      family of whom Paddington moved in with) across the bustling city of London (in 6 neighbourhoods) in order to
      become famous among the British people and become the perfect 'Gentlebear'.

      Players simply move Paddington by tapping the stylus on wherever they want on the pavement, as well as
      double-tapping on the location to make Paddington run. The stylus is used to talk to characters, collecting
      certain items needed throughout the tasks and activating objects around the streets. The upper screen displays the
      number of quests currently completed, the name of the street you're in, the number of marmalade sandwiches found
      (one of Paddington's favourite snacks!) and the current score. The game also includes a wide variety of minigames
      with players to test their skills.</story>

    <story>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity is the ninth game in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series and the
      first for the Nintendo 3DS. The player is a human who has a dream about a Munna being chased by a Hydreigon and
      calling for help. The human then wakes up in a strange world and discovers they have been turned into Pokémon, and
      starts plummeting down through the sky to the ground! When they wake up, they find another Pokémon leaning over
      them and asking if they are okay. After introductions, the player accompanies this Pokémon through a cave to a
      desolate plot of land, which the Pokémon purchases. The Pokémon tells the player their dream of creating a Pokémon
      Paradise, and asks the player to help them. The player agrees and they become partners.

      The game is similar to previous entries in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series, but there are several new features.
      The Pokémon the player transforms into can be chosen by the player. The choices are Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott,
      Pikachu, and Axew. The player's partner can also be chosen, the choices being whichever four of those same five
      Pokémon the player didn't become. The game is rendered entirely in 3D, and takes advantage the the Nintendo 3DS's
      built-in 3D capabilities. The game also utilizes the AR (Augmented Reality) features. By using the Ar feature on
      round objects, a portal called a Magnagate opens up. This means there is an unlimited amount of Mystery Dungeons
      that can be explored within the game. TMs (Technical Machines) can now be reused as much as the player wants,
      reflecting the change in their function in the main series Pokémon games. Moves now have ranks, and will progress
      toward the next rank each time it is used. Another new feature is mini-games, which are hosted by Beartic.
      Depending on how well the player did, they may receive different prizes from completing mini-games.</story>

    <story>In this enhanced remake of Pokémon Ruby Version, players travel throughout the Hoenn region on a journey to
      become a Pokémon Master. Like the original, the goal is to challenge the eight Pokémon Gyms of the Hoenn League
      and earn badges from their Gym Leaders, then take on the Elite Four and the Champion. However, the world is
      endangered when the villainous Team Magma tries to expand the continents by resurrecting the ancient Legendary
      Pokémon Groudon.

      Aside from technical upgrades, the game is drastically changed in certain aspects. The Hoenn Pokédex is changed to
      add the evolutionary relatives of Pokémon from its original incarnation. Some Pokédex entries are also changed.
      Mega Evolution plays a major part of the storyline, and a new form change is introduced in the form of Primal
      Reversion, exclusive to Groudon and Kyogre. Some characters have had major redesigns in terms of appearance.
      Instead of roaming Hoenn after defeating the Champion as in the original, Latios automatically joins the player's
      party after summoning the player Southern Island. Latios can be used to soar through the skies of Hoenn, taking
      the player to locations known as Mirage Spots that cannot be reached otherwise. Pokémon Contests return under the
      name "Contest Spectacular" and have some new mechanics, while the basic format is largely the same.

      After the main story, a new chapter called the Delta Episode is unlocked, allowing the player to once again save
      Hoenn from disaster. Finally, the Battle Tower is replaced by the Battle Resort, which features tough Trainers as
      well as a replica of the Battle Maison from Pokémon X and Y.</story>

    <story>Control cute Toy Pokemon and have exhilarating battles in Pokemon Rumble World! This downloadable game for
      systems in the Nintendo 3DS family is packed with Pokemon that you can battle and befriend. You can collect 719
      species of Pokemon: all the ones that have appeared in the video games up through Pokemon Omega Ruby and Pokemon
      Alpha Sapphire. When you defeat one of the wild Pokemon you meet in a stage, it sometimes becomes your friend.
      Even Mega-Evolving Pokemon will join the battles, a first for a game in the Pokemon Rumble series!



      Befriend as many Pokemon as you can: as you collect more species of Pokemon, your Adventurer Rank goes up. As your
      Adventurer Rank goes up, the shop will offer more products, and stages will feature stronger Pokemon.



      It's not just Pokemon that will appear in Pokemon Rumble World. Your Mii character will also appear in your game,
      as well as the Mii characters of players you pass! It's the first time in the Pokemon Rumble series that Mii
      characters have joined in to interact with Pokemon and have adventures together.



      Your story is set in the kingdom of toys, and the adventure starts when the king summons you. He explains his
      frustration at having only one Pikachu. In contrast, a mysterious magician has captured several Pokemon! So the
      king asks you to show that magician a thing or two by collecting lots more Pokemon, and he lends you his Pikachu
      to get you started on your adventures. Depart from the castle town via a hot-air balloon to get to different areas
      where wild Toy Pokemon await!



      It's fun to connect with other friends playing Pokemon Rumble World. Players can visit your castle town via
      StreetPass. Connect your Nintendo 3DS system to the Internet, and Mii characters of faraway players will visit
      you. They can even provide support for you in future battles in a variety of ways.



      Poke Diamonds are meant to make your adventures even more exciting and easy. With Poke Diamonds, you can get
      hot-air balloons, clothes for your Mii character, extras that provide more fun in your game play, and more. In
      addition, Poke Diamonds can be used to continue playing in a stage after your Pokemon's HP runs out, as well as to
      re-inflate hot-air balloons that have become deflated after use. You can acquire them in various ways, including
      at the beginning of the adventure and when you speak to Mii characters who come to the castle town via StreetPass.
      You can also purchase Poke Diamonds at the shop in the castle town via Nintendo eShop.</story>

    <story>Pokémon Sun, along with Pokémon Moon, marks the start of the seventh generation of the Pokémon franchise. The
      game takes place in the Alola region, an archipelago whose culture, geography, and native wildlife are based on
      those of Hawaii. A number of Alola's native Pokémon have never been seen before, bringing the series' total number
      of Pokémon species to over 800.

      The story follows a customizable protagonist who has just moved to the region and received their first Pokémon.
      What differs from past installments is that instead of the usual challenge of defeating eight Gyms, Alola is host
      to the island challenge, in which trainers face seven trials that test many other skills in addition to battling
      prowess. Only after clearing the seven trials and defeating the four island Kahunas can a trainer be called a
      champion. As the player character embarks on their island challenge, they are joined by a local boy named Hau,
      another newcomer to Alola named Lillie, and the mysterious Pokémon Cosmog that is under Lillie's protection. The
      group is forced to deal with Team Skull, a group of thugs who commit petty crimes under the leadership of their
      ruthless boss; the Aether Foundation, a wildlife conservation group with connections to Cosmog; and dangerous,
      otherworldly creatures called the Ultra Beasts.

      As usual for a new pair of Pokémon games, Sun and Moon boast a number of new and improved features. HMs are now
      replaced by Ride Pokémon, which are unlocked over the course of the story and can be called upon at any time to
      provide transportation and clear obstacles. Hyper Training allows players to boost their Pokémon's individual
      values, hidden values that impact a Pokémon's potential for stat growth and are otherwise immutable. The new
      Battle Royal mode pits four trainers against each other in a free-for-all fight where the goal is to score the
      most KOs while trying not to let one's own Pokémon faint. A group of islands called Poké Pelago allow the player's
      Pokémon to play and collect items while they aren't in the active party, and each island can be upgraded to
      provide more and better rewards. Lastly, a location called the Festival Plaza acts as the multiplayer hub, and
      combines features from prior games' Join Avenue and PSS systems.</story>

    <story>Professor Layton and Luke head to the town of miracles, Montdol, in search of the Mask of Miracle. The mask
      has the ability to grant wishes to its wearer. Layton and Luke arrive at the town to see they are too late, as a
      mysterious man is using the power of the mask to turn people to stone. Layton and Luke task themselves with
      solving the mystery of Montdol and the Mask of Miracles.

      This fifth game in the Professor Layton series makes more use of the physical button controls for puzzle-solving
      as opposed to just the touchscreen. To take advantage of the hardware capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS, the
      characters are rendered in polygons outside of cutscenes, as opposed to sprites, in addition to other polishings
      of the interface.

      Beside the regular adventure where you traverse the town, talk to the characters and solve puzzles, there are
      several mini-games that get gradually unlocked as you play and find the unlockable items:

      Bunny - after a while, you will stumble upon a circus bunny that isn't performing well and decide to help it
      along. This will require constant training of new moves which will become available over time as you acquire them.
      After you teach the bunny new moves, you will be able to instruct it to use those moves during the theatrical
      performances. Theatrical performances consist of a director telling you what the story is about and what he wants
      to see in each scene, and you will have to instruct bunny to act accordingly, providing you have taught it the
      moves necessary to perform the full play.
      Robot - after you acquire a toy robot from one of the street vendors, you will be able to play levels that will
      become gradually available. Levels are rectangular in shape and you can move your robot left, right, up or down
      through the field of squares. Each movement uses some of the battery and you have to reach the end square before
      the battery depletes which still gives you a lot of time for trial and error. Single movement will move your robot
      by three steps unless it bumps into a wall or picks up some special items that may temporarily boost its power to
      eat through the wall and enemies that move in pre-defined patterns.
      Shop - helping the friend in need, as a true gentleman, this mini-game will let you order the items in the store
      so that when customer comes to buy what he or she wants, the rest of the items also catch his/her eye and in turn
      you end up selling all your wares. Base item is initially set in the store, and you can place other items only
      adjacent to already placed items in the store. What will catch the eye of the customer after purchasing some item
      is the adjacent item that is either of the same type or of the same color. Placing two similar items might confuse
      the customer due to ambiguity which may lead the customer to stop buying after a while if the net remaining
      adjacent item has no connection to the last item he or she purchased.

      Beside mini-games there are many collectible items you can find during your exploration and some of the flashback
      sub-stories become available after certain key events which can then be watched as short episodes where characters
      vary from event to event, and might not even be one of the leading three characters.</story>

    <story>Arle Nadja has been through a lot of crazy adventures before, but nothing quite like this! On a peaceful day
      in Primp Town, Arle and her good friend Carbuncle were enjoying the day, when all of a sudden, a book with a moon
      and sun dropped from the sky and transported the dynamic duo into a strange new world! Why? As it turns out, she's
      the so-called "Great Hero" of this particular world. But there's no time for dilly-dallying... Arle, aided by an
      adventurer named Ally, and a host of other friends that also got sucked in, may as well high-tail it to the tower
      if she's to fulfill her destiny in this world... and to make it back to hers.

      Puyo Puyo Chronicle is a puzzle/RPG set in the Puyo Puyo universe where Arle Nadja and a host of other allies must
      fight through a world full of monsters to save it from total destruction. Battles are fought in a variation of
      standard Puyo Puyo fashion: attack enemies by making chains, while at the same time trying to alternately conserve
      health and avoid getting swamped in Nuisance Puyo! Winning battles gains experience and levels up the party, which
      makes characters stronger. In addition, a series of side quests can be completed, with wonderful rewards awaiting
      at the end.

      Of course, it wouldn't be a Puyo Puyo game without the Battle Mode, where up to 4 players face each other in a
      fight to the last.</story>

    <story>What happens when two classic puzzle games collide? Culture shock, and lots of it! That's what the characters
      of the Puyo Puyo series find themselves in when a whole host of crazy characters claiming to be Tetris masters
      crash into the Puyoverse. And it's not only Tetris they want to play - they also claim to be pretty good at Puyo
      popping! Can these two brainteasers co-exist without driving each other crazy?

      Puyo Puyo Tetris is a combination of the Puyo Puyo and Tetris series in which the player battles through seven
      chapters of 10 stages each, playing as a total of 26 characters in the hopes of determining which puzzle game
      series is the better of the two. As usual, the objective is to score chains and drown opponents in a wave of
      Nuisance Puyos and/or extra blocks. But the rules change every time - one match might have the player(s) swapping
      between Puyo Puyo and Tetris fields, while another may allow them to use items to hinder opponents' progress.
      Also, at certain points, the player will encounter challenges, where the objective is to reach a certain goal
      before time runs out.

      The traditional battle mode is of course still intact, with up to 4 players battling for Puyo (or Tetris, or who
      knows? Maybe both) bragging rights.</story>

    <story>Puyo Puyo 20th Anniversary is an installment in the Puyo Puyo series. Gameplay-wise, the basic elements of
      Puyo Puyo are still there - eliminate Puyos and bury your opponents in a landslide of Nuisance Puyos. But in
      addition to the standard "Puyo Puyo", "TSU" and "Fever" rules, there are also new gimmick modes and modes
      returning from past Puyo Puyo games. The most noticeable rule change in the game, however, may be the "Pair Puyo"
      mode, a co-op mode where two teams of two players battle it out to end all their opponents' lives.

      In the standard Story Mode, players take one of 24 characters through their own 8-stage course, which all fit into
      the big picture as Ekoro (Ringo Andou's antagonist from Puyo Puyo 7) rises again to cause chaos to the world. In
      addition, several of the characters can have alternate voices, and still others can have alternate costumes. The
      battle mode is still intact, with up to 4 (8 in the DS and 3DS versions) players fighting it out across the

      The story is set principally on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship in the Mediterranean, where Jill and

      the ship hides danger around every corner as Jill and Parker explore the confined space of the ship and must face

    <story>Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D is not a typical Resident Evil title. It handily shrugs off the horror
      atmosphere of past titles for horror-themed action and combat. The Mercenaries 3D is essentially a full game
      version of the now classic Mercenaries mode found in Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5.

      Gameplay

      The Mercenaries 3 plays almost exactly like the Mercenaries modes of it's console brethren. It is an
      action-oriented title where players can choose any of eight playable characters to shoot, explode, and melee their
      way through swarms of marauding enemies. The game is viewed from the over-the-shoulder style of Resident Evil 4
      and Resident Evil 5, switching to a zoomed view when targeting enemies. The zoomed view can be played in either
      third or first-person.

      The gameplay is straightforward and simple: Kill as many enemies as possible within a time limit, or kill a
      required number of enemies before time runs out. Stages have individual settings, such as all being done in a set
      time limit, having a time limit that can be extended, defeating waves of enemies, or defeating a boss character.
      All enemies and stages are taken from and inspired by Resident Evil 4 and 5. There are thirty individual missions
      in all.

      Features

      The game features a variety of features to add some depth to the original experience. Most notable is the wide
      variety of Skills that can be applied to each character and upgraded. Each character can carry up to three
      different skills at one time, and they gain experience and improve as the game is played with them equipped.
      Skills such as being resistant to death, reloading guns faster, better use of medical supplies, and the like are
      peppered throughout the game. These are unlocked by playing through the regular game and accomplishing various
      tasks, such as building combos with kills.

      There are also a wide variety of medals that can be earned through the game for completing various tasks. There
      are fifty medals that can be earned which range from simple "Clear all Missions for Level 1" to more
      challenge-focused elements like "Kill 3 enemies with 1 hand grenade" or "Clear a mission without ever missing a
      shot."

      There is a level of weapon customization and there are alternate costumes for all the usable characters as well.
      Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D is also playable in co-op both online and in local play.

      Resident Evil: Revelations

      Arguably the biggest added feature to the game is that is comes with a playable demo of the next main-line game
      for the Resident Evil series, which is called Resident Evil: Revelations and is geared towards the classic
      survival horror style of the franchise. The demo is brief, but intended to give players an idea that Capcom is
      interested in successfully combining the survival horror aspects of the original games with the refined gameplay
      from modern titles. The demo lasts for about 5 - 10 minutes depending on the player.</story>

      damage first-hand and learn all the ways the Galari people are fighting back. But once he's there, he finds
      there's no way home, and his princely name holds little sway over the long-suffering people of this new world.

      It is up to you, as Prince Pietro, to make a life for yourself in Galariland while seeking a way home, doing

    <story>Raphael, a normal boy by day, acts as the legendary art thief Phantom R by night. He is well-known for
      stealing precious paintings and returning them days later, never getting caught. His true motive can be traced
      back three years prior to the start of the game, where Raphael's father mysteriously disappeared and left him with
      a strange coin. Raphael found all of the paintings his father had stolen shortly afterward, replacing them with
      forgeries. As Phantom R, Raphael works to replace his father's forgeries with the original artworks, meanwhile
      hoping he will someday find his father again.

      At the start of the game, Raphael finds a lead in the form of a museum exhibit which is currently displaying a
      bracelet with the same symbol as that on his father's coin. As Phantom R publicly announces his intention to steal
      the bracelet, Raphael must deal with the unraveling of a mystery involving a hostile man who claims to be the
      historical Napoleon, a mysterious girl named Marie who seems to have some connection to him, and the whereabouts
      of his very own father that may put him in over his head.

      Rhythm Thief &amp; the Emperor's Treasure is a mix of adventure and rhythm, following the story of a Parisian
      mystery. The player can explore various landmarks of Paris during their search for clues in a point-and-click
      style reminiscent of Professor Layton. Advancing through the plot may involve solving puzzles or, more frequently,
      completing a mini-game where Raphael must move to the beat. These games may make use of either the stylus or the
      gyroscope feature of the 3DS; depending on how closely the player has followed the rhythm, a letter rank will be
      given. Coins can be found throughout the city and used to buy items for use in a mini-game. Optional mini-games
      may also be found throughout the city, holding references to other SEGA franchises.</story>

    <story>Hanzo National Academy is, to outside observers, an ordinary if prestigious prep school. However, there is a
      secret curriculum at this school, sponsored by the national government, to train promising young candidates in
      shinobido -- the way of the ninja. Of the more than 1000 students at the academy, five cute young girls have been
      selected for this program to become agents of justice for their country. But not all ninja work for just and
      righteous masters, and their struggle against evil -- not to mention with everyday teenage life -- has only just
      begun.

      Senran Kagura is an action beat-'em-up game starring a team of ninja-in-training high school girls. The story is
      broken up into missions, which generally involve beating up on waves of enemy ninja in classic side-scrolling
      fashion, with various other objectives depending on the stage. It is possible to switch between the five members
      of the team between missions; however, some missions can only be tackled with specific characters.

      Each girl has their own unique sets of combos and attacks, earns experience and levels up separately, and can be
      dressed up in numerous unlockable outfits. Outfits take damage and can be destroyed in battle, which affects the
      character's abilities; there is even a special "inochigake" ("life on the line") state where the character rips
      off their own clothing, granting them a boost in attack power for a short time, and giving additional bonuses if a
      mission is cleared in this state.</story>

    <story>The ninja girls are back! Senran Kagura 2 is a direct sequel to the original Senran Kagura, picking up the
      story at the final chapter of that game. While the basic beat-'em-up gameplay has not changed much, new in this
      installment is the Pair Battle system, which allows control of two characters for certain missions, switching
      between them on the fly. Certain character combinations will even allow for special combination attacks, and it's
      even possible for the rival Hanz? and Hebijo teams to fight together.</story>

      world and seeking treasure. However, when the two explore the Tower of Fate, the two fall to the dark magic power
      of a cursed amulet. When Shovel Knight reawakens, the Tower has been sealed and Shield Knight is nowhere to be

      absence, the Enchantress rises to power, spreading evil across the land. Upon hearing that the Enchantress has
      unsealed the Tower of Fate, Shovel Knight takes up his shovel again and ventures towards it, hoping to find and
      rescue Shield Knight. In order to do so, Shovel Knight must fight the eight members of "The Order of No Quarter,"

    <story>SoniPro is a management simulation and rhythm game featuring Nitroplus' mascot character Super Sonico. It
      plays much like a combination of the earlier SoniComi and Namco's The Idolmaster. The player takes the role of a
      young producer at a talent agency who has been tasked with developing Sonico's talents, image, and career. While
      she may be a beautiful young girl with a great singing voice and skill with a guitar, she is still inexperienced,
      rather naive, and lacking in confidence, and as such needs proper guidance to become a real star.

      The game is broken up into three distinct sections. The bulk of the game is spent in conversation mode, where the
      player speaks with Sonico and the other characters, as well as plans her schedule and events. Quite often there
      are dialogue choices which will influence Sonico's progress and character, which in turn leads to different types
      of job requests. There are also two types of events; Live Events and Gravure Events. Live Events are a live
      performance of a song, which plays out like a simple rhythm game, while Gravure Events involve taking photos of
      Sonico in different outfits, and giving her instructions on how to pose. Performance in each of these sections
      also determines Sonico's popularity and influences her career.

      There are also Free Live and Free Gravure modes available, where the player can simply enjoy the unlocked content
      for fun without without worrying about specific requests or career progress.</story>

    <story>Super Mario 3D Land is a platform game that has been described by game designer Shigeru Miyamoto as a "3D
      Mario that plays as a 2D Mario game." As such, Super Mario 3D Land combines the elements of traditional
      side-scrolling Mario titles, such as linear-based levels, with those of the modern open world Mario titles, such
      as moving Mario in three dimensions and performing a variety of actions. Similar to the classic side-scrolling
      Mario games, the objective of each level is to reach and grab the "Goal Pole" located at the end of the course
      before the time limit expires. Super Mario 3D Land utilizes a similar health system to those games, in which Mario
      shrinks upon taking damage from enemies or hazards, and damage while as "Small Mario" results in losing a life.

      Experience the rush of robotic power in shape-shifting action game Tenkai Knights: Brave Battle on Nintendo 3DS
      and 2DS! Based on the animated TV series, prepare to bring the big guns - and swords! - into play against the
      villainous Vilius and his Corrupted Army. Can you stop him before he annihilates two entire planets?!

      When teenagers Guren, Ceylan, Chooki and Toxsa discover a rip in time and space, they arrive on planet Quarton,
      transformed into shape-shifting hero robots known as the Tenkai Knights! As Bravenwolf, Tributon, Lydendor and
      Valorn, their legendary prowess is put to the test when the rogue robot Vilius sets his sights on destroying both
      Earth and Quarton.

      Through explosive 2D, side-scrolling action, battle hordes of transforming mechanoids using each heros unique
      skillsets. There are stacks of strategies to employ, like Bravenwolfs nifty slides and slash attacks, or you can
      get to grips with Tributons deadly crossbow - perfect for picking off distant enemies! Better yet, Valorn can mash
      foes near and far, while Lydendor takes down bots with high-speed strikes. Robofusion Mode lets you combine with
      an ally to boost your powers, as you fight side-by-side for a set time.

      As you carve and blast a path to victory, youll get to use parts from defeated enemies to forge new equipment.
      With over a hundred customisation parts to discover, customise your character to improve statistics such as Dash,
      Range and Boost, and tweak them to fit your play style. Exploit enemy weaknesses or adapt to different terrains
      across the stages, then engage Titan Mode to beat the big bad boss, one-on-one!

      In addition to Story Mode, you can get together with up to three mates in VS Mode via Local Play to bash the

    <story>Terraria is a two dimensional platform game of exploration and crafting. Players can use mines and picks to
      collect various items from the environment including wood, ore and even spider webs. Resources acquired from the
      environment can be placed or crafted into all manner of items.

      The simple crafting system automatically lists any item that you have the materials to craft. First priority is to
      set up a base before night fall hits in order to protect yourself from roving zombies and eyeball monsters. You
      can craft many items for your home, including doors, walls, tables, chairs and beds.

      During the daytime slimes roam the land and must be avoided or dispatched with a weapon such as a sword or axe. As
      you gather materials you will be able to construct more powerful weapons from different ores as well as armor to
      protect yourself.

      30 monsters are present in the game including slimes, floating eyeballs, giant earth worms and zombies.

      Building a nice home will attract NPC (non-player characters) to your house to set up residence. These can include
      a merchant to trade with and nurses who can heal your wounds.

      Terraria supports single player, multi-player servers and player vs player combat.</story>

    <story>Tetris Ultimate is a reworked version of the original Tetris falling block puzzle game, for modern platforms.
      The available game modes are Battle, Battle Ultimate, Endless, Marathon, Sprint, and Ultra.
      Battle is a versus mode against the computer or another player. There are four difficulty levels for the computer.

      Battle Ultimate is a versus mode that introduces power-ups to clear lines, have the grid scroll sideways, explode
      blocks, or shower opponents with blocks to remain the last one standing. Power-ups are gained by clearing lines
      that have symbols.

      Endless lets you play up to level 30, with a faster speed for each new level.

      Marathon is the classic mode where you need to clear a number of lines to reach a new level with faster speed,
      with fifteen levels in total.

      Sprint is about clearing 40 lines as quickly as possible.

      Ultra provides three minutes to achieve a high score.Not all game modes are available right away. Endless for
      instance is only unlocked after completing Marathon. Multiplayer is supported both offline and online, for up to
      four players and game types such as Marathon or Endless. Players can also work together or co-op or in a team to
      clear lines on a grid that is larger than the standard one. There is a leveling system with belts based on the
      player's performance, also used for online matchmaking. The core gameplay remains unchanged. Pieces can be moved
      left and right, drop quickly, or are rotated. The next piece is shown and it also possible to hold on to one to
      use it at a later time. The game includes an in-game store for additional content and generates a Tetris Self
      diagram, an AI-controlled version of your playing style and performance friends can play against when you are
      offline. By enabling Tetris Live you open up your games for other players to join. Game options include enabling
      hold pieces, using the 7-bag or the classic selection for tetrominoes, toggling wall kicks and T-spins, and
      altering the time it takes for a piece to lock into place on the grid.

      The 3DS version is largely identical to the other platforms in content, but there are some differences. Exclusive
      to the 3DS version are four challenge modes:
      Escalation: similar to Marathon or Endless, but each new level requires more lines to complete.
      Invisible: tetroninmoes become invisible when they are locked on the grid.
      Master: regular gameplay, but tetronimoes do not appear at the top, instead they appear instantly at the bottom.
      Rotation Lock: you cannot rotate tetronimoes.The later PS Vita release has three additional game modes: Haunted,
      Landslide and Time's Up.</story>

    <story>Set in the not too distant future, Japan creates the Information Self-Defense Force (I-SDF). The creation of
      this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan's constitution, and it causes tensions to rise
      between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and
      Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time,
      Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information
      warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam
      Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important
      element of it all.

      In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher
      has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife.
      Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the
      player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.

      The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced
      through some areas in a "tunnel" like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they
      can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross
      the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight
      entirely, but still winding up in the same location.

      Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New
      York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.

      The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There
      are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and
      Xbox versions feature this mode.</story>

    <story>Wipeout 2 is a game based on the "game show" of the same name on major television network ABC in the United
      States. In it, the game is organized as if players are taking place in numerous events over the course of an
      "episode," as if it's part of a television episode. Each event is preceded with an introduction by in-game
      characters of the hosts of the show (John Henderson and John Anderson), and just before beginning the event, a
      mock interview with hostess Jill Wagner.

      Events are organized in four rounds as such: A Qualifier round, an Elimination Round, a Final Four round, and the
      final Wipeout Zone. Some rounds are played with players taking turns, and some are played simultaneously (when in
      two-player mode). Players are simply competing to complete the ridiculously set-up stages with the fastest times.
      Episodes are split into Summer or Winter events, and there are four episodes per season. Players will dodge giant
      hammers, bounce on the iconic giant balls, dodge swinging or turning beams, manage balancing acts, and other
      events.

      The main draw of the game is it's focus on motion controls, especially with the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Wii
      versions, using Kinect, Move, and the Wii Remote respectively. The Xbox 360 version also features different
      character models than the other retail versions as they are designed around the style of Xbox 360 Avatars, and
      players are able to use their own Avatar in-game, as well as snapshots taken during gameplay.

      The game also features replays, a Practice mode, and a behind-the-scenes video.</story>

      The main gameplay consists of guiding Ralph and Felix through several platforming levels in 3 worlds (Fix-It Felix
      Jr., Sugar Rush and Hero's Duty) within Game Central (the game's main hub). Wreck-It Ralph's abilities include
      smashing wooden crates, a ground pound to defeat enemies and pushing and pulling several objects, while Fix-It
      Felix Jr.'s abilities include double-jumping, wall-jumping, throwing his prized hammer and even repairing broken
      objects.

      Scattered throughout the levels include coins (that add towards your score), Hero Medals and even Easter Eggs
      (which are stored in the Trophy Room, even unlocking bonus concept artwork from the film). Cutscenes in-between

    <story>The YO-KAI WATCH game is about hundreds of sometimes cute, sometimes spooky, and usually mischievous Yo-kai
      that inhabit our world. Yo-kai are not ghosts, monsters or creatures. Yo-kai are, quite simply, Yo-kai. They
      cannot be seen by the human eye, but they are everywhere. Whether born from the soul of a deceased human, or an
      everyday object discovering its higher purpose, their personalities are distinctly humanlike.

      As you explore the world, use your Yo-kai Watch to find them, befriend them, and turn them into a team to battle
      other Yo-kai. Befriending new Yo-kai may not be so easy, though â€“ in many cases, you will need to battle with
      them and impress them during your battle. Each Yo-kai has its own unique skills and strengths and youâ€™ll use
      them to challenge the evil Yo-kai and help people in need of solving daily problems â€“ like an argument with a
      friend or forgetting something important â€“ which may be caused by mischievous Yo-kai hidden everywhere.</story>

      series' fun game-play mechanics such as Yoshi's Flutter Jump, Ground Pound and Egg Throw return, but now Yoshi
      knows a ton of new tricks too. Yoshi gets to bash and thrash his environment by throwing around Mega Eggdozers and
      Metal Eggdozers. Yoshi also can transform into a variety of objects, such as a jackhammer or a submarine, both of
      which can be manipulated using the Nintendo 3DS gyro controls. A certain type of star even transforms him into
      Super Yoshi, giving him the ability to fly through the sky or run along walls and ceilings. Players who are having
      trouble completing a level might see the appearance of Flutter Wings, which let Yoshi fly through the air.</story>
