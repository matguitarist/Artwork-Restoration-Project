    <story>1552 Tenka Tairan is a war strategy game set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history (1552-1600)
      when ambitious daimyo (feudal lords) began to overthrow their superiors, resulting in a global war for dominance
      in Japan. The player controls a warlord, choosing one of the available historical figures or creating their own
      character. Character creation is Ultima-style where are a series of questions generates the player-controlled
      general with relevant statistics.

      The gameplay involves managing the army, advancing the troops, conquering neighboring provinces, defending castles
      with a wealth of tactical possibilities. Though the game pauses when the player makes a decision, the time
      advances regardless of the player's actions, effectively making Tenka Tairan a real-time strategy game.</story>

    <story>Sanjiyan Henj? is based on the manga and anime series 3x3 Eyes. Pai, a young girl from the immortal tribe of
      sanzhiyan, three-eyed demons of Chinese origin, wants to become a human again. She meets a Japanese teenager named
      Yakumo Fujii, whom she accidentally turns into a "wu", an immortal obedient servant of a three-eyed demon.
      Together, Pai and Yakumo try to regain their lost humanity.

      This game can be considered a side-story to the series. The player does not control Yakumo, but an ordinary
      high-school student named Kenichi Yamamoto. Accidentally, Kenichi comes into contact with the world of demons, and
      now he needs the help of Pai and Yakumo to be freed.

      The gameplay is standard Japanese-style adventure. The player interacts with the game world by selecting menu
      commands "Look", "Talk", and "Move". The game features animated cutscenes and (in its console incarnation)
      voice-overs.</story>

    <story>Based on the Addams Family movie, this game is quite different from the other Addams Family variants. The
      player is cast in the role of Tully Alford, the crooked lawyer of the Addams family. He finds out that somewhere
      in the family mansion, a great treasure is stored in a vault. He decides to venture into the mansion and retrieve
      the treasure. Naturally, this is going to be anything but easy, as the insane Addams family members and a legion
      of ghosts and monsters are there to make sure the lawyer fails...

      Like most other Addams Family incarnations, this is a side-scrolling action game. Tully Alford's only weapon is an
      umbrella that fires energy shots at enemies. Tully can also jump and duck to avoid enemy blows. The game world
      consists of a "hub" area, the hall of Addams Family mansion, and many rooms, most of which are locked in the
      beginning of the game. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are
      needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are
      infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.</story>

    <story>The story of Advanced V.G. follows a similar template as those of the previous Variable Geo games: the
      strongest young women in the country hold a tournament, which is sponsored by various restaurant chains, which in
      turn ask the competing girls to pose as waitresses working in said restaurants, for promotional purposes. The
      girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young
      martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition.

      Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic "kick" and "punch" moves, while the
      various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game,
      "Normal", "Vs.", and "Story". The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an
      AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo "computer vs. computer" gameplay, with the
      possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the nine heroines is available as a playable character in these
      modes (Yuka Takeuchi, Chiho Masuda, Jun Kubota, Manami Kusunoki. Kaori Yanase, Reimi Jahana, Satomi Yajima, Ayako
      Y?ki, and Erina Goldsmith). The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only,
      and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches.

      The SNES received a stripped-down version, Super V.G., without the Story Mode and all explicit hentai elements.
      Hybrids (pair of bosses in Advanced V.G.) were also removed.</story>

      Both games play very similarly: the player has to roll dice in order to navigate his/her alter ego on a board with
      medieval/fantasy backgrounds. Depending on the result, the character advances a certain amount of squares, which
      lead to various quiz challenges. The player has to answer a series of questions within a time limit, choosing the
      right answer among the several (usually four) available ones. The themes of the questions are varied, ranging from
      history and geography to Japanese popular culture and very specific themes (such as bicycles). Two-player gameplay

    <story>Kenbu is a young warrior who trains in the art of shape-shifting - his people possess the ability to turn
      into beasts. One day, his home village is attacked by a hideous spider-like monster. Kenbu's best friend and
      mentor dies protecting him. The young hero kills the monster, but soon thereafter has to leave the village and
      find out who or what was behind that attack. Kenbu encounters other heroes, and together they must stop the evil
      that is threatening the entire world.

      Alnam no Kiba ("Fang of Alnam") is a traditional Japanese RPG. Kenbu and his party roam the top-down world,
      walking on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The
      battles are viewed from the same top-down perspective as the navigation (like in Alshark). Every action in battle
      depletes a certain amount of spirit points. The heroes can use regular attacks, magic, and unite attacks, that do
      high damage to all enemies, but consume a lot of spirit points.</story>

    <story>Wisperad is a small universe that consists of only a few star systems. Hundreds of years ago, light-speed
      travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish
      contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where
      the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have
      increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres
      of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.

      A young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous
      explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the
      physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the
      meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and
      escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to
      different corners of the universe.

      Alshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a
      party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own
      planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help
      of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the
      player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money.
      These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons
      manually, in an arcade shooter style.

      The bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in
      vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from
      the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other
      characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can
      equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A "party talk" feature is
      available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing
      the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.

      The Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version
      has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also
      greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the
      difficulty level of the game.</story>

    <story>The two sisters, Ai and Yuuko, have taken different paths in life. Yuuko has been taken away by a mysterious
      gang. Ai is determined to save her from the clutches of crime. In a seemingly all-female city overrun by insane
      workers, biker gangs, and assorted criminals, Ai and her friends Chika and Makoto decide to work together in order
      to restore the world to normality again.

      Ane-san is what is commonly called beat-'em-up, i.e. a fighting game that allows limited movement through
      side-scrolling environment. The player can choose to control a variety of female fighters. In the beginning, only
      Ai, Chika, and Makoto are selectable. Ai is the all-around balanced character, Chika is fast and fragile, while
      Makoto is very strong, but slow. Later in the game, other playable characters become available. Each fighter has a
      health points bar, which can be restored by healing items scattered through the levels. Once a character is dead,
      the player can continue playing with another one.

      The player typically advances through side-scrolling stages, clearing each screen of enemies before being able to
      continue walking to the right. Each girl has the standard kicks, punches, and jumps at her disposal, as well as
      special moves, one per each girl. Stages culminate by boss battles (usually two per stage).

      Between the stages, the player can go shopping. A large variety of items is available, some enhancing the
      performance of the girls, but most purely for visual effect - the room the player views between the stages changes
      its appearance depending on the items the player has bought.

      Also available between the stages (and as a separate gameplay mode, "vs.") is a mini-game, in which the player(s)
      have to rapidly press buttons in order to make the controllable girl execute a hideous grimace, that will surpass
      that of the opponent in ugliness and speed of execution.</story>

      Avenger is a vertically-scrolling shooter, in which the player navigates a plane through levels populated by
      hostile planes, tanks, cannons, ships, stationary devices, and massive boss enemies. Before each mission, the
      player can choose among different weapons in three categories: main, sub, and special. Main and sub weapons are
      fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by pressing a
      different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example
      enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective
      shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at a specific time
      to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties of a weapon, but

      exile, and work together to restore the throne to its rightful owners, persecuted by the ruthless Empire and its
      allies.

      Though Basted may look like an RPG at first sight (medieval setting, top-down world, game progression that

      the player explores the surroundings, talks to people and participates in battles to advance the story. There are

      fire attack. Regular attacks can be powered-up if executed when the attack power meter is at maximum. Both girls
      can also charge power to execute devastating special attacks (two unique attacks per girl). They are also able to
      dash and attack while dashing, inflicting more damage.

      The game features a large amount of fully voiced anime-style cutscenes to advance the story.</story>

    <story>Bazaru de Gozaru no Game de Gozaru is a puzzle game starring a monkey protagonist named Bazaru. The concept
      of the game is remotely similar to that of Lemmings: the player's task is to "program" the actions of the hero in
      order to safely traverse a stage full of traps and hazards. Unlike Lemmings, there is only one primate to control
      in this game; also, the player's "programming" must be performed before letting the monkey loose, unlike the
      real-time player input in Lemmings.

      The player basically orders the monkey what to do at specific spots (which are highlighted by exclamation marks on
      the level map). In the beginning the levels are short and simple, and the monkey can perform only one action. As
      the game advances, the puzzles become more and more complex, and so is the amount of actions the monkey must
      perform to reach safety.</story>

      originated with stickers on chocolate bars, and later evolved into collectible card game, manga and anime series.

      The game's structure mimics collection of Bikkuriman stickers. The original stickers had different values; the
      bizarre Bikkuriman characters were divided into three classes (Angels, Protectors, and Demons), and the
      highest-rated (and rarest) stickers were the so-called "Heads", mostly bearing names from various mythologies and
      religions ("Super Zeus", "Maria", etc.). In the game, the player can view a number of the more "ordinary"
      stickers; the "head" is available only after having answered a trivia question correctly.

      Each "head" unlocks a map part of the Bikkuriman world; each part, in its turn, unlocks a series of short
      non-interactive scenes from the anime, accompanied by narration.</story>

    <story>Camp California is the second and last game based on the short-lived multimedia property of the same name,
      featuring a group of anthropomorphic animals who are the official mascots of surf rock group The Beach Boys.

      In the game, the gnarly surfer dudes of the Camp California crew find that their favorite beach has been sold to a
      villain called the Big Cheese who plans to build a nuclear power plant in the area. The gang's plan: hold a
      benefit concert to raise enough money to buy back the beach. Unfortunately, the Big Cheese gets wind of the plan
      and sends his henchmen, the Ratz, to kidnap the crew, steal their instruments and take the tires off Woody, the
      gang's trusty vehicle. Luckily, Byron the bear was out surfing while this happened, and it now falls to him to
      rescue his friends and get back the tires and the instruments.

      The game is a side-scrolling platformer consisting of nine levels, with such areas as a beach, a junkyard, an
      amusement park, an army base and a mall. The levels are reached via an overview map of California that players
      drive along in Woody. To start the car, the tires must be found in the first level. All other levels then contain
      instruments or members of the crew to rescue. At the start, players can only control Byron, but once a new friend
      has been rescued, they can be selected to be played at the beginning of a level. All characters differ in
      abilities. Byron punches and kicks to defeat enemies while Lil' Bro (the star of the previous game) uses his
      skateboard to skid or jump on top of the bad guys. Shred can turn into a tornado, Pouch headbutts and is also the
      only one who can swim underwater, and Scream'r uses a boomerang and is the only one who can fly.

      Besides many enemies (mostly the Ratz gang, but also robotic dogs and other critters) the levels include
      recyclables to pick up, like soda cans and banana peels. When a level is completed, the trash is converted into
      fuel for Woody. If the fuel runs out on the overview map, the car can only be restarted at the loss of a life.

      The game features voiced cutscenes and CD-quality background music, including three Beach Boys tracks: Fun, Fun,
      Fun, I Get Around and Good Vibrations.</story>

      The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent.
      The "free play" mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents
      is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack.
      The opponents undress after losing a game; however, they retain their underwear - there is no explicit nudity in

      shattered when the King is killed by a dragon, and a range of nasties inhabit the lands. Fortunately his twin sons
      have come to the rescue, and you must take control of one or the other to put the world right.

      The boys have differing skills - one is more skilled in sword-fighting (which you are always armed with), the
      other in magic (available in limited amounts on each level). You collect coins as the game goes on, and spend
      these in the shop on extra magic, extra lives and enhanced swords.

      There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens and The Sea, and these can be tackled in any order. The first is
      straight platform action, the second involves jumping across clouds, and the third sees your characters swim.
      After those are completed, you must venture into the Monster Castle and finally slay the dragon.</story>

      Like the previous game, it is a Japanese-style RPG set in a mixed sci-fi and medieval world. The game has random
      enemy encounters and simple turn-based combat mechanics. Player-controlled characters can learn and use various
      offensive and healing spells; however, enemies are restricted to physical attacks. Characters join and leave the

      Leaving Soron, his home village, the hero embarks on a journey to find companions and to face together the forces

      Despite being a Japanese game, Death Bringer is more similar to Western RPGs of the time than to their Japanese
      counterparts, even though it has anime-style character graphics. It is less event-oriented than Japanese games and
      focuses on exploration. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Pandora's RPG of the same name, even though the two
      games are unrelated. Both friendly and hostile areas are pseudo-3D, maze-like environments, like in Bard's Tale
      games. Enemy encounters, however, are handled more similarly to those of Ultima: the enemies appear on the
      exploration screen, and the battle initiates only if the player character approaches the enemy. The battles take
      place on a top-down field; the heroes and the enemies move around, but the player can't navigate the characters
      manually: it is only possible to issue commands such as "Attack", "Use Magic", etc. The game has a day/night

      joining the hero for plot-related reasons.</story>

      safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.

      Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car
      forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being
      hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy
      creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy
      fire, avoiding damage.

      Over the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in
      purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, "boxing glove" that hits enemies from the
      side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.</story>

    <story>Another day at Nekketsu High, another gang tournament... but this time its different! A wealthy school
      principal has placed a challenge for all the school gangs to compete in a special obstacle course composed of 4
      different challenges that you and your team must overcome. First in line is a race across the city streets (and
      rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in which you have to
      break a series of metal balls, and finally an all-out fighting tournament.

      The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay mechanics featured in other Nekketsu High games, with the only
      change being the goals you must complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the characters are gang members,
      fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and
      power-ups can also be found in the courses</story>

      This interpretation of Ryuusuke Mita's manga Dragon Half is entirely different from the computer version. It is a
      combination of a board game and an RPG. Up to 4 players can compete, each controlling a party of characters from
      the manga. The navigation takes place on a large board, and is controlled by dice rolls. The player can advance
      only as many steps as the number on the dice; however, most of the board has many different paths and crossroads,
      which allows certain freedom of movement and planning.

      Different spots on the board have a variety of effects on the party. Red-colored spots lead to turn-based enemy
      encounters. The player must press a button in time to choose an attack by a specific party member, and also to
      determine its strength. Experience points are rewarded after battles, and the characters level up in a fashion
      similar to other Japanese RPGs.

      Other places on the board include damage traps, shops, trigger meetings with other characters, lead to healing
      spots such as pools and hotels.</story>

      The remake has the same story (the wandering knight Takeru has to defeat a demon who threatens a town populated
      only by women) and core gameplay (explore a huge dungeon full of monsters, return to the only town to buy better
      weapons and equipment), but features better graphics, more convenient battle interface, and voice acting.

      Despite the abundance of pretty girls, there are no explicit sex scenes in this game.

      As the name implies, the remake also has a "graffiti mode" (accessible from the main menu), which lets the player

    <story>Strawberry Fields - a magic country populated almost exclusively by beautiful young girls (that is, if we

      the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning
      them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a
      young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the
      curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our
      adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful!

      Dragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever translated
      into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the
      three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were
      turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various

    <story>This version of Dragon Knight III is based on the earlier computer release, known in the West as Knights of
      Xentar. While retaining the story, the graphical style, and the basic location layout of the computer version,
      this release has substantial gameplay differences.

      Unlike in the computer version, the battles are not real-time, but turn-based, and utilize a different
      perspective; randomly encountered enemies are fought in a first-person, Dragon Quest-like traditional Japanese RPG
      style. Enemy design is also quite different; many of the monsters from the original version have been replaced
      with female characters. The graphics in the top-down areas have been slightly enhanced.

      This version also censors the adult content. The scenes are still suggestive, but there is no explicit nudity in
      them any more. Some of the cutscenes have been completely re-drawn, eliminating even implicit sexual activity.

      he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human
      child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and
      that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together
      with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after
      Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and
      find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear
      among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find
      Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

      The game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game
      world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing
      features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their
      movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The
      player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different
      sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a
      "world map": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.

      The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version of Emerald Dragon contains additional dialogue, scenes, and voice acting.

    <story>Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams plays in a similar way to other scrolling shooter video games such as R-Type.
      What distinguishes Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams from other games of a similar ilk is its bright colourful
      graphics and its lead character, Cotton. The game also takes place in a fantasy dream-like world instead of space
      like many other shooting games. The game can be compared to other fantasy Shoot 'em up games like Parodius. It
      bears most similarities in style to the Chariot game on Three Wonders.

      The player controls Cotton, a young witch on a broomstick. The player must blast various monsters and avoid being
      shot. The player can collect power-ups to enhance their weaponry and unleash a more powerful attack on the enemy.
      The player has lives represented by an arrow. The player has three lives and is only allowed one hit per life.

    <story>Long time ago, humans lived in a paradise, the Garden of Eden. But the brave and audacious members of the
      Fire Clan were banned from Eden, and had to seek shelter on the Earth. They built their own paradise - the land
      they later called Jipang. However, the evil demon lord Masakado wanted to destroy Jipang, and the Fire Clan fought
      and defeated him. Now, many years later, a young thief named Ziria learns that he is a descendant of the Fire
      Clan. He must now find the other members, and prevent the resurrection of Masakado by his followers.

      Loosely based on the Japanese folk tale of the ninja Jiraiya, Tengai Maky?: Ziria was the first role-playing game
      released on a CD ROM; thanks to the medium's greater storage capacity, the game was able to include full-screen
      anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs. It is the first entry in the Tengai Maky? series, and is generally
      considered the first RPG with significant humorous content. The game's setting parodies many aspects of feudal
      Japan, containing comical and sometimes deliberately stereotypical portrayals of characters and plenty of
      supernatural elements.

      Basic gameplay mechanics follow a template introduced in early Dragon Quest and Phantasy Star games. The player
      navigates Ziria and other characters who eventually join him on a top-down overworld, visiting towns to rest and
      buy supplies, and facing randomly appearing enemies in round-based combat viewed from first-person perspective.
      Each character uses his or her own unique weapon and equipment types. Magic spells cannot be bought or learned
      automatically when leveling up; they must be sought out in specific locations, often those not required to visit
      in order to advance the story.

      The game's overworld is fairly vast, divided into provinces, each containing several towns and other locations. It
      is possible to teleport instantly from the world map to any previously visited province.The game emphasizes
      overworld exploration; dungeons tend to be smaller and less maze-like than in many other contemporary role-playing
      games. In towns, the player can gamble and deposit money in banks; this money is preserved if the party is
      annihilated in combat and transported back to the town, with the money it was carrying cut in half. When a
      character levels up, his or her hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) are fully restored.</story>

    <story>Many years ago, the legendary warriors of the Fire Clan were expelled from the Garden of Eden, and built the
      wonderful land Jipang. Thousand years later, Jipang is entering its medieval era. It seems that the province Hida
      is suffering from a curse placed upon it by the evil clan of the Dark Orchids. To destroy the Orchids, a young boy
      named Manjimaru has to fight the demons who protect them, find companions who would help him on the quest, and
      prove he is worthy of his great legacy as the descendant of the Fire Clan.

      Tengai Maky? II: Manjimaru is a sequel to Tengai Maky?: Ziria. Though not connected to its predecessor directly
      story-wise, the game is set in the same semi-humorous rendition of feudal Japan, and shares many recurrent
      gameplay-related and stylistic elements. The player navigates a party of up to four characters on a vast overworld
      divided into provinces, each with its own capital city and several smaller towns. Randomly encountered enemies are
      fought in turn-based, first-person view combat. Like in the previous game, magic spells must be obtained by
      locating Tengu Retreats; they can be then equipped on any character and swapped between them.

      Enemy hit points are displayed during battles, and characters are restored to full health when leveling up.
      Full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voiceovers advance the story. As opposed to the previous game, Manjimaru
      has several audio music tracks in addition to synthesized ones.</story>

    <story>Feed Sluster is a fiend hunter: a man who takes job that involves elimination of mysterious beings known as
      fiends. One day he is contacted by a woman named Beth, who offers him a more demanding job, which involves
      investigating shady activities between humans and fiends, and getting to the bottom of the entire mystery,
      discovering the origin of the fiends and determine their ultimate fate.

      Fiend Hunter is a cinematic platformer set in an Old West-like environment with supernatural elements. With the
      exception of the initial town and a few other locations, the game is spent in areas that require carefully
      navigating Feed through a series of platform-like structures. Controls and animation resemble those of Prince of
      Persia. Feed can jump, run, perform a running jump, hang on ledges, pull up or drop down, kneel and crawl. He also
      takes falling damage; the primary challenge during platforming sequences consists of preventing him from falling
      down.

      Enemies only appear at pre-set points; each battle is one-on-one, and it is impossible to escape from a fight.
      Coupled with the enemies' high HP count and varied attack patterns, this essentially turns each encounter into a
      boss battle. Feed fights with a sword and can perform various moves, combining attacks with jumping and ducking.
      He can also gain access to a few magic spells.

      A little fire fiend named Exy accompanies Feed on his journey. Exy can be used as offensive and defensive
      enhancement in combat, and can also be set to light dark areas. Each enemy drops a special orb that can be used to
      increase Feed's vitality, attack power, or magic, as well as teach Exy more powerful attacks, which gives the game
      a light RPG flavor. Feed can also equip rings and buy or find health-restoring and protective potions.</story>

    <story>Fushigi no Umi no Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water is one of the several games based on the anime series of

      frame of late episodes, where Grandis and the jewel thieves have already joined Jean and Nadia on their travels
      with Captain Nemo on his submarine "Nautilus". Following a dramatic scene that reveals more about Electra's past,
      the crew is stranded on a mysterious island. Jean, Nadia, Marie, and the lion cub King decide to explore it, and
      discover an ancient civilization in the process.

      The game plays mostly like an interactive comic book or a visual novel, though it does contain adventure elements
      such as verb commands. However, these commands are usually very sparse, and there are no sub-menus with objects or
      people to interact with. The game advances linearly, and the player's input is for the most part reduced to
      choosing between several locations to explore first. There is also a separate quiz mode where the player answers

      blue power-ups; collecting a power-up of the same color enhances the currently equipped weapon, while a
      differently-colored power-up changes weapon properties while retaining whatever enhancements the ship might have
      had with the previous weapon. The actual properties of each weapon is different for each ship, and include various
      combinations of lasers, beams, missiles, piercing and homing weapons.

      Each ship also has two pods on the sides that fire simultaneously. If the player releases the fire button for five
      seconds, the pods will charge up and damage enemies with electricity during the next shot. In additions, the ships
      can also drop bombs that heavily damage all the enemies on the screen; up to two bombs can be carried at the same
      time. The stages include various themes such as medieval, feudal China, ancient Egypt, etc., all with a strong
      sci-fi angle. The player can continue up to nine times from the same spot if the protagonist runs out of lives,
      and additional continues are granted when the player gathers a sufficient amount of points.</story>

      and their leader Lia has become a friend, fighting crime on her own in a superhero TV show. Life seems to continue
      normally, the only trouble being Erika, a snotty high school girl who sees herself as Yuna's biggest rival. She
      challenges Yuna to a fight, but both are spotted by the titular starship "Eternal Princess", commanded by the
      pretty Princess Mirage, whose task is to stop violence in the whole galaxy. What begins as a misunderstanding ends
      as a serious threat to the Earth...

      Eien no Princess is what is usually called a "visual novel". Most of the game consists of the player being taken
      to different locations automatically, where he watches the story unfold, accompanied by text and voice acting.
      Sometimes there is a menu verb to click on (such as "Look at..."), which doesn't mean much since the menu offers
      no choices. There are, however, a few turn-based battles in the game, with different attacks to choose, such as

    <story>This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a fighting
      game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional
      Toho lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has two modes: Normal and
      Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a
      variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed
      the Normal mode.

      The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the
      final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the
      player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance,
      points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate
      more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.

      The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different
      moves. Naturally, the normal "punch-kick" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological
      peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range
      fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its
      blood.</story>

      own reason for trying to overthrow the evil rule of Death-Adder, who - along with his forces of darkness -
      kidnapped and imprisoned the King and his daughter and stole the legendary Golden Axe.

      This is a horizontal fighting game, where you basically take one of the three characters (the barbarian Ax
      Battler, a dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead or the amazon Tyris Flare) and bash everything which stands between you
      and Death Adder himself. Each character has a special magical ability that can be charged by kicking small blue
      creatures that drop a potion. There is also a green variety off this creature that drops food that replenishes
      your health. Some enemies ride dragons and a scorpion like creature. The enemies can be knocked off and you can
      mount the creature yourself and attack the enemies with it.

      The game allows to play up to two players on a same screen, however in the C64 version this option has not been
      implemented. C64 version was also stripped off in the other areas, such as: only one enemy can engage the player

      all the heroes and villains already acquainted with each other. The story focuses on the Mikami GS agency, led by
      the young, pretty, and charismatic Reiko Mikami. The main protagonist, however, is Tadao Yokoshima, a young boy
      who works for Reiko and idolizes her. Together with their friends, the innocently-looking yet powerful Meiko and
      the ghost girl O-Kuni, Tadao must rescue Reiko's spirit which became entrapped as a result of a confrontation
      against a powerful demon.

      The game plays mostly as a Japanese-style adventure, with very limited interaction options; on most screens, only
      the commands "Look" and "Talk" appear, and the story advances even if not all the commands are used. Some scenes
      feature top-down navigation on a map, with icons representing concrete locations.

      In addition to the adventure gameplay, the game also features card-based strategic battles, as dictated by the
      story in the scenario mode, or as the only gameplay possibility in the free battle mode, which allows the player
      to choose a character and compete against a variety of opponents. The card game has a "rock-paper-scissors" flavor
      to it, with different attacks winning or losing against others, but also with additions such as wildcards or the
      option to shuffle the deck with a chance of receiving better cards. Attacks during card battles are displayed as

    <story>Originating on the arcades (where it was known as Demon's World to the Western audience), Horror Story is an
      "old-style" side-scrolling platformer/shooter. The basic gameplay premise is very simple: shoot and jump your way
      through large amounts of monsters, defeat the boss, proceed to the next level. There is no narrative of any kind
      in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking Duke Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns.

      The screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player character doesn't move. The levels are almost entirely
      linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative
      two-player mode is available.

      Though shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used
      liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on their
      heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as floating,
      constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get different
      weapons. These weapons include: a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a short-distance
      grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions.

      As the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with
      traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more "mainstream" horror, complete with haunted towns, ghosts,
      zombies, skeletons, etc.</story>

    <story>Power Golf 2: Golfer is a follow-up to Power Golf. The game attempts to realistically simulate golf and
      contains many features and variables that influence gameplay. There are two modes in the game: Normal and
      Tournament. In the normal mode up to four players can compete against each other or computer opponent in stroke
      play, match play, driving range, and putting green. Real Japanese golf courses are available for selection,
      complete with digitized photos and introductions. The player can select to control Japanese golfers and choose
      between a variety of clubs, as well as manually influence the shot, controlling force, angle, and the exact part
      of the ball the player wishes to strike.

      The Tournament mode is essentially a managerial simulation game. The player takes control of a golfer in an
      unnamed city. The goal is to accumulate enough currency and fame, as well as increase personal attributes of the
      golfer in order to participate in tournaments. Currency is obtained by doing part-time jobs, e.g. as a caddie in
      golf matches, or by gambling at slot machines. The player can also visits shops to purchase clubs and other
      golfing equipment. There is an in-game schedule that keeps track of tournaments and also incorporates random
      events (such as accidents). It is also possible to send the golfer on a vacation when he is too tired from working
      or practicing golf.</story>

      Hyaku Monogatari Kaidankai, which was popular during the Edo period (17th - middle of 19th century) in Japan. The
      game involved gathering at night, lighting a hundred candles and telling horror stories, extinguishing the candles
      one by one until the room became completely dark.

      The game contains a hundred horror stories told in a linear fashion through text, digitized photos and sound
      effects. Most of the stories are very short and non-interactive. The exceptions usually involve visual novel-like
      choices of locations or responses to situations, which sometimes affect the story's conclusion. A recurrent

    <story>After humans ventured into outer space, they began building colonies there. It became increasingly hard to
      maintain them, and special robots known as "Bidroids" were invented to do the hard work. However, the colonies
      began waging war on each other, and Bidroids were used for military purposes. When peace was finally achieved, the
      leaders decided that Bidroids could continue functioning as combat machines, but in friendly championships rather
      than in deadly wars.

      Hyper Wars is primarily a managerial simulation; robot combat itself is calculated depending on how the player
      created and maintained his or her robots. The player controls a manager of a team which competes in a league,
      complete with schedules, stadiums, etc. The player is given an initial budget with which he or she is able to
      create the first robot models and train them. Each robot can be created by merging together various parts
      ("human", "beast", "bird", and so on). After creation, it is necessary to outfit the robot with weapons and
      upgrade its parameters by paying for training. When the player feels ready, the robots can be taken to combat
      arenas and participate in the tournament.</story>

    <story>This version of Fray in Magical Adventure differs from the original MSX and subsequent computer releases in
      several ways. It retains the major events of the story and gameplay mechanics; even though it has more detailed
      graphics, it still looks too similarly to the original release to be qualified as a remake. The major difference
      is in the layout of locations and enemies. Some levels are entirely different, even when they are composed of the
      same elements. For example, the introductory level of the original version is skipped; the subsequent level has a
      different layout and new enemies. There are more treasure chests in this version's levels, more items, and more
      areas that require jumping.

      This version also has different cut-scenes (for example, the introduction describes some of the events during
      Fray's study years, which were absent in the original version). The conversations with other characters are
      longer; certain events are triggered in a different way (such as the necessity to first talk to the guard to
      trigger the conversation with the mayor in the first town). There is voice acting during important cut-scenes.

      The core of the gameplay are the trivia "battles" against randomly appearing characters. Each "enemy" will ask the
      hero one question in a variety of topics (English language, geography, popular culture, etc.). Answering the
      question correctly within the time limit will "kill" the enemy, while giving a wrong answer will reduce the hero's
      HP by one point. Boss enemies offer a choice of topics and take several correct answers to defeat. A few items can

      stupid ape Mantou.

      Beside the scenario mode, there is also a Vs. mode, which is basically a two-player mode, allowing two players to
      fight against each other as any of the eight characters; and a so-called "Life Attack" mode, which randomly
      chooses AI-controlled opponents for a player-selected character.

      Kabuki Itt?ry?dan plays like a typical fighting game, the two basic moves being a kick and a punch; other moves
      are unique for each character and involve strong melee moves or magic-like ranged attacks. For example, Kabuki is

      Most of the background and character graphics is done in anime style, with the exception of Noriko herself, who

      The game plays like a standard action side-scroller in which you must clear each stage of all enemies using your
      attacks and make your way to the end-level boss, kick his metallic behind and advance to the next stage. You have
      at your disposal an energy blade and a small collection of ranged attacks to deal with your enemies, and between
      certain stages you get to play shooter sequences to spice things up.</story>

    <story>Kakut? Ha? Densetsu Algunos is a fighting game. It doesn't have a developed story; rather, it tells
      background stories of the ten fighters the player can control in the game: Jenius, Asasin, Arcer (sic to all
      three), Samohan, Greeze, Orga, Lobo, Blocken, Jyobei and Daibuster. The only time the background story is told is
      when the player selects a fighter in the story mode. Usually, the five "good" fighters have to face the five
      "evil" ones one after the other (each in different order) if selected in the story mode. Though the game's intro
      states that it is less about who is good and who is evil, and more about who is the better fighter...

      The gameplay is for the most part traditional fighting game-style (with the obligatory two-player battle mode as
      an option to the linear story mode); an important difference is the fact that some of the characters use swords
      and other weapons, rather than fight with their bare hands. The traditional "kick" and "punch" buttons are called
      "short attack" and "long attack" here; their execution is unique to each fighter.</story>

      Kaze Kiri is essentially a beat-em-up with a few distinguishing characteristics. The game consists of traversing
      fully linear side-scrolling areas, defeating regular enemies and bosses on the way. Before being able to fight the
      stage boss, Kaze has to vanquish a pre-determined number of enemies, which is displayed as a shared enemy HP on
      top of the screen.

      Kaze attacks with his sword when he is near the enemy, or throws shurikens at them from afar. Enemy projectiles
      can also be blocked by countering them with shurikens. Kaze can also disappear for a moment and re-appear at
      another location. He can jump, duck, perform somersaults, and grab and throw enemies. Kaze's health regenerates

    <story>In 21st century, Tokyo was suddenly attacked by combined forces of robotic and organic alien races. A special
      giant mecha fighter craft was constructed in order to avert the threat. A young pilot is sent on the most
      dangerous mission of his life.

      Kiaidan 00 is a horizontally scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up. The basic gameplay is similar to other games of this
      genre; however, the weapon system differs from the traditional power-up and upgrade style. The player character
      has all the weapons at his disposal from the very beginning. The five weapons include spreading energy blasts,
      focused multiple shot, laser beams that travel in different directions, an energy ball that protects the ship from
      frontal assaults, and an extended arm that hits enemies melee-style. The player can cycle through and choose any
      of these weapons at any time.

      Instead of the traditional secondary weapon system the game offers charged modes for all the weapons. When a
      weapon is charged it either becomes more powerful or gains new properties (for example, the extended arm becomes
      longer and is controlled from a distance). The player character's health is represented by shield units, which can
      also be picked up in the stages. Dialogue and cutscenes advance the story between and within missions.</story>

      being chased by dark and evil knights. She joins them and tells the story of an evil man and his army of knights.
      As any traditional strategy game, fights are round based and always start with a scrollable top view of the battle
      field. During each round, you can either move your characters or engage a close combat if you are close enough to
      your enemy. The view then zooms in and displays your opponents and yourself, and enclose any characters near to

    <story>The game is based on the anime Gulliver Boy, created by Teruhisa Hiroi. Gulliver is a young boy who studies
      magic in a school in a small town in Italy, but is bored with the studies and craves adventure. After he gets his
      magical diploma, he goes to Venice to hook up with his best friends - the girl Misty, who has healing powers, and
      the genius inventor Edison. Together, they must stop the plot of the Spanish crown to dominate the world.

      K?s? Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy differs greatly from the Super Famicom interpretation of the anime. Unlike that
      action role-playing game, it is a traditional Japanese-style turn-based RPG. It utilizes traditional battle system
      with a four-heroes party, physical attacks and magic, etc. Stand-out features include a money system that is based
      on trading rather than obtaining gold from defeated foes, and the fact that the enemies are visible on the field
      and the combat initiates once Gulliver comes into contact with them, rather than appearing randomly.

      Much of the exploration in the game is done by navigating a ship across the Mediterranean sea. Though story
      progression is linear, several areas of the game's fairly vast world can be explored in a non-linear fashion. The
      setting is loosely based on real world locations, with deliberately stereotypical, comical and anachronistic
      elements, involving science fiction and supernatural themes. The game features full-motion anime-style movies
      (instead of comic-book-like cutscenes typical for PC Engine CD games) and voice acting.</story>

      Laplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for

      gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or

      commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life!

      The game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to Falcom's other

      weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in
      combat, controlled by the computer AI.

      The game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which
      Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the
      combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time

      evil Dragon Riders. It seems the search won't be as easy as they have thought, as Areios gets involved in a
      dangerous adventure again.

      The sequel is very similar to the first game gameplay-wise. The player explores towns, vast outdoor areas, and
      dungeons, engaging enemies in real-time combat. Damage is inflicted upon the enemies simply by running into them,
      without any special attack button. There are various weapons to equip, and they level up in proficiency the more
      the player uses them. Areios gains additional hit points depending on the damage he receives. Party members help
      him in battles, controlled by the AI. The day and night cycle of the previous game has been removed.

      Like in the previous game, there are side-scrolling segments which lead to boss battles at the end of each
      chapter. Compared to the first game, these stages are noticeably shorter, each containing only the boss fight
      itself, omitting platforming sections with regular enemies. Bosses must be fought using conventional action
      gameplay, attacking by pressing a button and jumping to avoid their attacks. It is also possible to defend

    <story>An asteroid is nearing the planet Neo Kenya. Scientists warn that the planet might be completely annihilated
      by it. In a most unexpected turn of events, a deity known as Anubis spoke to people and asked them to save the
      planet's animals before the asteroids hit it. Anubis sent the humans a huge ship - a magnified version of Noah's
      Ark - and demanded that one man and one woman should dedicate their time to saving the animals. A whole special
      team has been assigned to the project. Ken is one of the youngest members of the team, and he is sent on the grand
      mission to save the animals, together with his childhood sweetheart, the lovely Linda.

      This somewhat unusual premise translated itself into the gameplay mechanics. Though Linda³ is first and foremost a
      Japanese-style RPG - with top-down "world map", towns, turn-based combat, simple leveling up, focus on narrative
      and characters, and so on - it also has gameplay features rarely seen among games of its genre.

      There are no random enemies in the game; they are visibly walking on the screen, and a contact with them triggers
      familiar turn-based battles (viewed from first-person perspective). Hostile animals should not be killed, but
      captured. They can be then used in towns for a variety of purposes, including weapon and armor enhancement, food,
      etc.

      Animal saving is pivotal to the game's plot progression; in fact, at the very beginning of the game, the game
      offers three selectable difficulty levels, which are determined by the amount of animals Ken must save in order to
      complete the mission.

      Beside hostile animals, there are also certain types of animals (such as dogs) that will join the party and fight
      alongside Ken and Linda.</story>

    <story>Loom was the fourth game to use the SCUMM scripting language. The game follows Bobbin Threadbare as he learns
      how to use his magical powers through his distaff and as he eventually saves the world from the Lord of Chaos, who
      was unraveling the Loom (the source of power for the members of the weaver's guild).

      Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay
      system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells
      (called "drafts" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument
      called "distaff". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.

      Although the PC Engine version is CD based, it isn't a port of the PC CD-ROM version. Instead, it features mixed
      visuals from the 16- and 256-color versions adapted to the PC Engine's color palette and enhanced CD soundtrack

      Magicoal is a "pseudo-RPG", i.e. an action-adventure with some minor RPG elements (money, items, etc.), but
      without an experience system of any kind. It can be played in two-player cooperative mode, controlling Rhun and
      Melvy, or as a single-player game, choosing one of them and letting the computer AI control the other. The
      player(s) can switch between the two at any time.

      Most of the game is dedicated to exploring top-down areas populated by enemies, and dealing with them in
      action-based combat, primarily relying on magical spells. While some of the spells have unlimited use, others must
      be "refilled" with special items found or dropped by the enemies. Rhun and Melvy learn spells unique to each

      taken into the nearby cave. Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await
      the hero on his journey...

      La Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations,
      fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically,
      and advancing the story in a linear fashion.

      However, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons,
      distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies
      are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various
      towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them,
      and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.

      The entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no "world map", which is characteristic for other
      games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on "level-grinding"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given

      play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows

      up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can
      summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen.

      Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only
      have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your
      monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks,
      some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different
      terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type
      (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can
      summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control,
      which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.</story>

      Megami Tengoku is based on an anime of the same name (translated as Megami Paradise). It plays like a traditional

    <story>Metal Angel is a managerial simulation game that takes place in the futuristic society of 2014, where battles
      between fighters in mechanized suits have become a major sports event. The player takes control of a coach who
      must train five young women of different backgrounds, all of which aspire to become a professional fighter. The
      coach's statistics are generated by answering a series of questions in the beginning of the game. Each of the girl
      also has her own statistics that must be carefully monitored. With the exception of automatized events, the game
      consists of creating schedules for all the girls for one week in advance, and then watching how their attributes
      change. Activities include battle training, gymnastics, running, resting, etc. All the activities are displayed as
      small animated segments on the same screen.</story>

    <story>The follow-up to Metal Angel is, like its predecessor, a managerial simulation in which the player character
      trains young girls to become champions of a fighting championship where participants don mechanized power suits.
      The player controls a manager rather than a coach in this installment, and must keep an eye on the finances as a
      result. Also, instead of training all the five girls from the first game, the player's answers to the questions
      posed by the assistant in the beginning of the game determine the choice of the trainee among the same five
      characters.

      The player must make schedules for the fighter, which include various training and recreational activities. The
      manager can hire coaches with their own programs, or input activities individually. The battles themselves allow
      little input, with the player being able to choose between various types of attacks by selecting them from a menu;
      the outcome of the battle largely depends on training and individual statistics.</story>

    <story>The plot of Metamor Jupiter is simple: a biological mutation causes an alien race to spread all over the
      galaxy. Armed with advanced technology, the aliens sent their machines and robots to face humanity in a cosmic
      battle. To counter that, the humans draw from the newly discovered crystal energy to deploy a unit of powerful
      fighter crafts, which can change their shapes in an instant, adapting to every situation.

      The player controls one of such crafts, and has to fly and shoot his way through side-scrolling levels populated
      by regular enemies, bosses, and various types of hazards. Other fighters will accompany the player-controlled
      machine from time to time, but they usually don't survive the robotic onslaught, and the player character is left
      to fend for himself.

      As the premise implies, the defining feature of the game is the fighter craft's ability to change shapes. The
      three main variations have two weapons each, which are suited for different situations. For example, one of the
      forms has vertical fire, but lacks powerful explosives; another can drop bombs, but has a slow forward beam
      attack, etc. Each of the forms can gather power-ups, which will strengthen the conventional weapons.

      Unlike most shooters of this kind, there are no "lives"; instead, the player-controlled plane has a set amount of
      hit points, parts of which are depleted when it gets hit. Hit points can be restored by catching power-ups
      scattered across the levels.</story>

    <story>Minesweeper is a minesweeping game, just like the one included in every copy of Microsoft Windows since
      ancient times. On a grid, the player clicks in a cell and hopes that it is not occupied with a mine. If it isn't,
      that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical
      thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, the player can conclude which cells contain a
      mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, the player progresses to the next minefield.

      Three main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a
      minefield takes the player to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to clear.

      A second mode is a mission mode ("voyage mode" in the PC Engine version), where the player is presented with 10
      minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only 4x4, growing larger and
      larger from then on. What is different about the mission mode is that a few cells in the minefield are revealed
      from the start, putting the player's ability of deduction at test. The editor mode allows players to construct a
      minefield of their own, by inputting parameters of size and amount of bombs.

      The Game Boy version can also be played by two players via a link cable. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx CD) version
      contains an additional mode entitled "Cook's Quest", in which the player has to help a cook to escape from falling
      boulders in a cave, represented by mines on a familiar minesweeper field.</story>

      transform into the glorious lady warrior Artemis. No, Hiwako didn't stop being a spoiled brat; but as Artemis, it
      is now her duty to protect her home town from a demonic invasion, and she does not intend to give up.

      Moonlight Lady can be called a "pseudo-RPG"; its top-down view and town exploration make it look like a
      representative of the Japanese branch of this genre, but in reality, it is an action game with light adventure
      elements and no true role-playing system.

      Throughout most of the game, the player controls Artemis and two other heroines (Aquarius and Minerva). Attacking
      is performed by pressing a button for the lead character's attack, and another for a simultaneous attack by the
      two other girls. The player can switch the leader at any time. The girls can also charge their attacks to execute
      more powerful ones.

      Regular enemies populate the dungeons, but there is no reward (in the role-playing sense of this word) in
      defeating them; in fact, the player can try to avoid them altogether and head straight to the boss battle.

      A few items can be found and used throughout the game, but there is no real weapon and armor management, nor a

      The gameplay mostly involves occasionally choosing actions when prompted; most of these are reduced to right and
      wrong choices, the latter sometimes leading to a Game Over. In certain cases the player can also decide a location
      to visit with Noriko; other locations may become inaccessible following the player's choice. Sometimes the player

    <story>Lord of Darkness, known in Japan as Bush? F?un Roku, is the fourth game in the Nobunaga series (but only the
      third one to have been localized in English). The story of Nobunaga takes place during the Japanese civil war of
      the 16th century. In a wartime strategy game, 15 different warlords are represented across several territories.

      One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two
      scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of
      population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right
      combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory.</story>

    <story>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal
      states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the
      land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a
      merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos
      to try to conquer Japan.

      Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to
      Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or
      a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several
      categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on
      events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly
      likely to die of old age or sickness.

      During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include:
      Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring
      Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's
      region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing
      orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force
      them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also
      affected by the terrain.</story>

      of any forms and components, with the limitation being the overall weight of the robot, which must not exceed a

      forms, etc.

      After a robot has been created, the player sends it to fight other robots. The battles look like those of a
      fighting game, with side-scrolling view and HP bars; however, they are non-interactive. The entire gameplay focus
      in on creating a robot in such a way that it would be able to defeat a particular enemy; the battles themselves
      allow no control from the side of the player.

      A "league mode" is also available, where the player(s) choose various models of robots and have them compete

      marriage takes place.

      Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre.
      Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly
      complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to
      give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.

      The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on
      pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an
      infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the
      game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health
      potions or permanently increased with large jars.

      The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version
      has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.</story>

    <story>Psychic Storm is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player takes the role of four characters who
      must protect Neo Hong Kong City from an assault by vicious insectoid aliens. The player can select any of the four
      characters before each stage. The characters are distinguished by the unique attacks of their ships: Alex uses a
      vulcan gun, Charr has short-ranged "psychic" beam, Joe has a slow, yet powerful Hell Flame attack, and Nastasia
      uses ion laser. Each character can also acquire additional weapons by picking regular power-ups.

      The game's stand-out feature, however, is its transformation mode. Each of the characters can transform to a
      larger and much more powerful biomechanical insect-like ship. The transformation can be performed at any time as
      long as the correspondent bar, which refills itself over the time, is not empty. The bar is reduced rapidly when
      the character is transformed; special power-ups can be collected from vanquished enemies to extend it temporarily,
      but once it is depleted the character transforms back to his or her normal form.</story>

    <story>Quest of Jongmaster is a mahjong game with role-playing elements. The "RPG mode" follows the story of an
      apprentice "mahjong warrior", a girl named Chi Fou, who is sent on a quest to defeat monsters that were unleashed
      on the world. This mode is structured like a traditional medieval top-down RPG, with town and dungeon exploration,
      NPC interaction, and other familiar elements. The protagonist can equip weapons and armor, cast magic, and
      purchase healing and status-recovering items. Experience points and money are awarded after each battle.

      Random and boss battles in this mode are standard mahjong games, with the addition of special tiles that influence
      the game's result, e.g. increase the damage inflicted by the equipped weapon. The final damage is calculated after
      the mahjong game is over, and depends on the characters' levels, equipment, and the winning combination. For
      example, winning the game with a full mahjong would most likely result in a "critical hit". Boss enemies typically
      take two or more rounds of mahjong to defeat.

      In addition, the game features a versus mode, which allows the player to compete in mahjong games against the
      opponents of the RPG mode, with weapons, equipment, and level parameters playing no role. These opponents appear
      as monsters at first, but are revealed to be pretty young women who remove parts of their clothes when losing a
      mahjong round; stripping down to underwear equals defeat. Despite this feature, there is no explicit nudity in the
      game.</story>

    <story>Quiz Avenue II, like its predecessor, is a quiz game with a story-driven quest mode, which continues the plot
      of the first game. After the evil Shameless were vanquished, peace was restored in the kingdom of Erudition;
      however, soon demonic forces appeared on the horizon, and two young warriors, one boy and one girl, were sent by
      the queen to stop them.

      The quiz rules in this installment are largely the same as in the previous entry, with three or four answers to
      choose for each question and a time limit. The board advancement, however, is determined by choosing cards with
      the amount of steps written on them rather than by dot-to-dot movement of the first game. New is the two-player
      mode for the quest, in which the second player controls the heroine, and the two are answering questions
      simultaneously. A few new features, such as the possibility to acquire various bonuses before a quiz encounter,
      have been added. The party mode is replaced by the so-called "F1 Grand Prix", which is a series of trivia
      questions where each round is presented as a Formula 1 race.</story>

      this installment of a series of trivia questions for up to eight players (controlling a variety of tough-looking
      fighters), with rounds disguised as fighting games, each wrong answer leading to a loss of hit points. The main
      difference between this entry and the previous ones lies in the quest mode and its RPG elements.

      Like a full-fledged role-playing game, the quest mode has leveling up, free top-down navigation, overworld, towns,
      dungeons, monetary system, weapons, armor, items, and even companions who join the main heroine, a girl named
      Konoha, who was raised by an old fighter and has to use her special abilities to rid the land of monsters. Battles
      occur randomly; the player has the choice to try to escape before the battle begins. Each enemy asks a row of
      trivia questions; correct answers damage the enemy and eventually defeat him, while wrong answers deplete the HP
      of the controllable characters. Levels, weapons, armor and items contribute to the damage equation, raising or
      lowering the amount of questions needed to answer correctly in order to prevail.</story>

      The "adventure mode" is a board game in which the player-controlled character's movement is determined by a dice
      roll. Normal fields lead to short quiz encounters; other fields may enhance the protagonist's hit points, and the
      final field on each stage is a more challenging "boss battle".

      Time attack mode involves answering correctly as many questions as possible within the allotted time limit.
      Finally, versus mode has players competing against each other; every right answer advances the character on a
      board, while the opponent is pushed back. All modes feature characters from other games published by Hudson Soft,
      such as Bomberman or Tengai Maky? series.</story>

      Another mode in the game is called "Megaten Quest"; however, it is not a Megami Tensei related quiz, but rather an
      imitation of a first-person dungeon crawler with randomly appearing enemies who ask the player a certain number of
      question on various themes. The third mode follows the same quiz format with correctly answered questions leading

    <story>Based on the popular manga/anime series of the same name, Ranma 1/2 follows the story of an aspiring martial
      artist who accidentally turns into a young woman by bathing in a cursed spring. He can revert to his natural form
      by touching hot water; however, contact with cold water will turn him into a girl again. Most of the original
      manga story is dedicated to semi-comical situations, based on the fact that Ranma is trying to conceal his
      predicament, which leads to misunderstandings, confusion, and romantic complications in his high school life.

      This interpretation of the license follows a part of the initial manga story, starting with the curse and going
      through Ranma's first conflicts with schoolmates and rival martial artists. The game is mostly structured like a
      "beat-'em-up" side-scroller, though there are also several boss fights that are more reminiscent of a one-on-one
      fighting game. The Vs. mode allows the player to recreate these boss fights using different characters.

      Ranma's curse becomes a gameplay feature in the game: cold and hot water turn Ranma into a girl and a boy,
      respectively. Female Ranma is quicker and can jump higher, but her attack and defense are lower. Anime-style cut

      pressing a button); the female Ranma is more agile but less powerful. The combat system includes characteristic

      water turns him into a woman, while hot water restores him to his original masculine form. Most of the story in

      win a contest that would allow him to travel to China and find a way to turn him into a man permanently.

      Unlike most other Ranma 1/2 iterations, this game is a so-called "digital comic", which is the same as

      characters have the same goal: prevent a secret organization of monsters and undead, run by a maniacal vampire,
      from taking control over Europe. The two characters begin with different initial stages, but continue on the same
      path afterwards. Seishiro is physically weaker and has a default ranged energy attack; Fujiro fights with regular
      punches and kicks. Both characters have access to unique elemental attacks that are activated by holding down a
      button. Most of the stages are straightforward side-scrolling action with boss battles at the end of each; a few
      areas contain light platforming elements.</story>

    <story>The police is afraid to deal with a criminal organization known as the Dragon Zone. Street punks and leaders
      of Chinese crime syndicates dominate the area where its headquarters are supposedly located. The young fighter

      friend, the punk Tony, Hawk enters the dangerous districts and is determined to rescue his sweetheart and put an

      Riot Zone (Crest of Wolf in Japan) is a rather simple brawler in which the player can choose to control either
      Hawk or Tony. Hawk is faster, but doesn't hit quite as hard as Tony. Both characters fight entirely unarmed, using

    <story>Road Spirits is an arcade-style racing game, similar to Rad Racer. The player controls a car from an "into
      the screen" 3rd person perspective, racing through the 17 pseudo-3D courses (named after various geographical
      locations, e.g. "West Coast" etc.). There are other cars on the road, which can slow down the player-controlled
      car by colliding with it, but the race is against time rather than against these cars. The player is given a time
      limit for each course, and an indicator shows how close the car is to the completion. Should the car run out of
      time, the race is lost, and the player has to replay it before tackling the next one.

      The car can be controlled with two buttons only; collisions do not damage the car, but merely make it stop; though
      the player can change a car model and gear system, no realistic gear-based driving is used in the game. All this
      contribute to the overall arcade feeling of the races.</story>

    <story>Long time ago, a thriving civilization blessed by the gods was ruined as a result of a perpetual war.
      Humanity has built a new civilization, which resembles a medieval world. The young swordsman Jan lives In the
      kingdom of Cordelia. One fine day he and Ortena, the daughter of the High Priest, go on a treasure hunt. When they
      return, they find the country overrun by monsters; Ortena's father is killed, and the princess of Cordelia has
      been kidnapped. The two team up with a legendary hero, in order to rescue those who can still be rescued, and
      fulfill the legacy of the gods...

      Ruin: Kami no Isan is an action RPG. The player navigates Jan through top-down towns and hostile areas; the "world
      map" is not free-roaming, allowing only linear advancement from location to location. Hostile areas are populated
      by enemies who are visibly walking on screen.

      Unlike most Japanese RPGs, there are no separate "battle screens" in the game; the monsters are fought on the same
      spot they are encountered on, like in action games. However, unlike most action RPGs, there is a party in Ruin.
      The player controls only Jan, while the other party members act according to AI routines: attacking, casting
      offensive and healing spells, etc.

      The rest of the gameplay is traditional Japanese RPG style: acquiring better weapons and armor, automatic leveling
      up, linear story development, etc.</story>

    <story>Sangokushi: Eiketsu Tenka ni Nozomu is a turn-based historical strategy game set in the Three Kingdoms era of
      the Chinese history and similar in concept and gameplay to Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, albeit with
      somewhat simpler gameplay. There is no scenario selection, and the exact timeline is not specified, though the
      initial situation corresponds to the phase of the war when Liu Bei and Cao Cao were the principal opposing forces.
      Players can choose to control any of the six most renowned warlords of the time, Liu Bei being the "default"
      player character with his own extended introduction and personal motives reminiscent of Luo Guanzhong's
      novelization of the historical events.

      Each warlord tries to gain dominance by building up diplomatic relationships and invading other provinces. It is
      possible to send offerings and diplomatic missions to other rulers, as well as manage army commanders, finances,
      and provision. Invasions take place on a tactical hexagonal grid, on which the player positions his forces and
      navigates them in turn-based fashion. When opponents meet on adjacent fields an automatic battle sequence ensues.

    <story>A mysterious young woman with a baby was attacked during the Holy Night. She managed to escape, but collapsed
      and died in front of the church in the city of Yalem. But the baby survived, grew up, and eventually became a hero
      on a quest to avenge his mother's murderers and save the world.

      Seiya Monogatari: Anearth Fantasy Stories differs from most other role-playing games in several important aspects.
      The player creates the main character in a unique way: when the baby lies on the snow outside of the church,
      several people pass by. The player can choose to press the action button, making the baby cry and attracting the
      attention of these people. Depending on the timing of this "baby action", the hero will be adopted by different
      people, which make him belong to a different character class (fighter, thief, mage, or monk), and also lead to
      four entirely different prologues (once the hero turns fifteen, the four stories eventually merge into one).

      Instead of random battles - or even regular battles with wandering enemies - the game has pre-set battles, which
      occur much less frequently than in traditional Japanese RPGs. Winning the battles depends less on leveling-up and
      more on the actual tactics used during the battle. There are no levels in the game; instead, the characters gain
      better statistics depending on their actions during battles (e.g., using magic will increase magic power, etc.).
      The battles are turn-based and are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective. The game focuses on exploration,
      having large and complex locations as well as plenty of items of different categories that can be found if the
      player explores the game world properly.</story>

      Japanese history. The player can take control of one of the three prominent warlords of the era: Uesugi Kenshin,
      H?j? Ujiyasu, or Takeda Shingen. Each warlord initially controls a province with several towns, and tries to win
      over territory by diplomatic or military means. Every turn the player has a limited amount of moves at his or her
      disposal; every general has his own options, though some (e.g. marriage) are restricted to the main warlord
      himself.

      Each town has to survive and raise reputation by maintaining an army and keeping the population happy. This is
      achieved by trading (buying and selling rice), giving money to civilians or soldiers, developing the town, etc.
      Every general can also strike alliances with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and send spies.

      When an area controlled by a general is invaded by the enemy, the game switches into a top-down turn-based
      tactical battle mode. The player positions and navigates soldiers, engaging in automatic battles when the
      opponents meet on adjacent squares. Castle invasion and defense can be carried out through various means: for
      example, it is possible to send an assassin to dispose of the enemy general, or assign archers to fend off the
      invaders from castle walls.</story>

      cases:
      The Mummy's Curse deals with the horrifying death of three men, which were apparently murdered by an ancient
      mummy;

      The Mystified Murderess involves a woman who has been convicted for murdering her beloved one, but cannot seem to
      recall anything of what had happened to her;

      The Tin Soldier concerns the murder of an old general, whose past must be investigated in order to find the
      killer.Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective can be described as a hybrid of adventure game and simulation.
      Gameplay process involves traveling to various locations in London, interrogating suspects, gathering clues,
      checking out the newspapers, and eventually presenting all the evidence to the judge; if the latter finds the
      circumstances incriminating, he will accept the results of the investigation, and the case will be considered
      solved. Though the basic gameplay is rather typical for adventure games, the amount of real detective work and the
      focus of the game on purely case-related actions rather than exploration and manipulation of items makes it
      comparable to a simulation of a criminal investigation.

      The game is notable for being one of the earliest "multimedia" titles, having been released on a CD ROM and
      featuring rather long (though windowed) video sequences with live actors as introductions and cutscenes, which
      frequently occur when the heroes investigate suspects.</story>

    <story>A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a
      strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front
      of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is
      being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool.

      "Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer.
      Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a
      virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. Unable to understand what that means, the young man goes outside
      and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city
      until the murderer is found. As the young man acquires a device that allows him to communicate with demons, he
      begins to realize that his role in the upcoming events may be greater than he thought.

      A follow-up to the first two Megami Tensei games, Shin Megami Tensei is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and
      post-apocalyptic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who consume a mysterious energy called Magnetite,
      which can be obtained from battles. The summoned demon joins the party and is then fully controllable by the
      player. The active party can include up to six characters: the hero, the heroine, and four slots usually reserved
      for the demons, though other human characters might also join. There is a wide variety of demons in the game, most
      of which are taken from real-world mythologies. The demons have levels, individual statistics, spells, special
      abilities, etc.

      Enemy encounters are random, and the first-person combat is turn-based. During combat, human characters can use
      swords or guns; the heroine is also able to learn and cast magic spells. Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game
      allows the player to raise the parameters of the two main characters manually when leveling up. A major gameplay
      element are demon conversations, which is usually the only way to recruit demons. Typically, the player has to
      convince the demon to join the party by choosing appropriate dialogue lines.

      All the creatures in the world of Shin Megami Tensei belong to one of the three ideologies: Law, Chaos, or
      Neutral. The narrative is largely dedicated to conflicts between these ideologies; during several key moments in
      the story, the player has to decide which one to follow. Joining one of the ideologies influences the subsequent
      narrative as well as some gameplay elements: certain weapons can be only equipped by a follower of a specific
      ideology, demons are more likely to join the hero if he shares their ideology, etc.</story>

    <story>Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling 94: Battlefield in Tokyo Dome allows the players to experience Japan's most popular
      professional wrestling promotion, New Japan Pro Wrestling. The game features real wrestlers from the time period
      it was released in. The wrestlers appear as digitized photos in the intro sequence and on the character selection
      screens; during gameplay, they are rendered as 2D graphical images.

      The game has four gameplay modes; the "battle mode" allows the player to choose one wrestler and compete against
      opponents chosen and controlled by the computer AI. The other modes correspond to a league, a cup (knock-out
      stages only), and a "versus" mode, in which the player can also choose any opponent to compete against. In every
      mode, the player is able to choose between single match (one-on-one) and tag team, with an additional wrestler on
      each side. The league mode allows competition between up to four players.

      The combat system is similar to that of fighting games, with a side view and health bars for the wrestlers.

    <story>Snatcher is set in the futuristic Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence. The year is 2047 (or 2042,
      according to the original Japanese version). Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form
      has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from
      another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial
      skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called "Snatchers" because they "snatch" their victims before they
      take their place.

      A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (which is
      deciphered as "Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Rangers" in the English version). Every time you
      encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked ? is it a person or a snatcher?

      The player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a
      Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving
      between locations and interacting with the environment. Typically, every room contains objects that can be

      various topics available and a wealth of information about the game's world and characters. A few parts contain
      light puzzle-solving elements, though as a rule the game is almost completely devoid of puzzles.

      During key moments of the narrative, the player will be prompted to participate in intense shooting sequences. The
      goal is usually to kill all the enemies that pop out on the screen before they are able to kill Gillian. Some of
      such sequences are timed, i.e. the player is required to quickly shoot before another events is triggered, leading

      Sol Moonarge is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. As in most games of this genre, the player navigates the main
      hero and his companions on the top-down "world map", entering towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as
      hostile locations which are necessary to complete to advance the plot in a linear fashion. Enemy encounters are
      random; combat is turn-based and viewed from first-person perspective.

      As in most Japanese RPGs, the characters level up automatically, after having accumulated a set amount of
      experience points; specific weapon and magic proficiencies, however, grow depending on the amount of times
      player-controlled characters use that particular type of weapon or spell.

      There is a day-night cycle (on the world map only), which influences people's schedules: at night the shops are

      The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between
      Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing
      more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters,
      choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns
      and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of
      magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength,
      intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.

      The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time,
      with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle
      actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing
      corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are
      usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.

    <story>In the future, mankind has learned to navigate space ships. Human beings spread out to different planets of
      the Milky Way. The hero of the game is a young pilot named Harry. He was testing the newest spacecraft model, but
      it crash-landed on Menaris, a planet at the outskirts of the Eva solar system, with a medieval-like civilization.
      Turns out that repairing the ship will be anything but easy, so Harry decides to stay for a while and to help the
      inhabitants of Menaris with their problems, which involve the over-ambitious Doran Empire. With the help of Aria,
      princess of Menaris, Harry must discover the truth about Doran's intentions, and when he learns it, he realizes
      that he won't use the repaired ship to return home, but will have to face something that threatens the entire
      galaxy.

      Star Breaker is a fairly traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down view, world map navigation, random turn-based
      battles, and all the other usual ingredients. Battles can be set on Auto for quicker pacing. Since the setting of
      the game is a mixture of sci-fi and medieval fantasy, character use a variety of weapons from swords to guns, as
      well as special psychic attacks. There are also some space ship combat in the game, and it is possible to upgrade
      the player's ship later on.</story>

      the country of Hyneld. The captain of the king's knights, Robin Solford, witnesses the dragon's attack on the
      castle. His two comrades are killed, and the princess Patricia, Robin's adoptive sister, is nowhere to be seen.
      Robin is determined to find Patricia and stop Dr. Killbait, and begins to wander around the world, hoping to find

      Startling Odyssey II: Mary? Sens? is not a sequel, but a prequel to the first game, Robin Solford being the father
      of the previous game's hero. The game is set in a predominantly medieval fantasy-themed world with a touch of
      sci-fi, and plays like a traditional Japanese RPG. The player navigates a party of characters on a top-down
      overworld, visiting cities and dungeon-like areas. Enemies are encountered randomly. Battles are viewed from
      isometric perspective, with an "auto" option to speed up combat.

      Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; the party will eventually contain four active combatants. Each
      character has his or her own sets of offensive, supporting, or healing spells, which are learned automatically

      spell of a unique virus that has driven them mad and threatens to destroy the planet if all the rulers declare
      all-out war.

      Only Blondia Varady (nicknamed "Blow") and his sister Fallandia have been spared from the disease and must pilot
      their fighter ships in order to penetrate deep into the domain of each princess, destroy their war machines, and
      administer the antidote. Fortunately for Blow, the antidote has been synthesized into his reproductive organ, so

      The player controls the fighter ship through vertically scrolling stages, trying to destroy every ship that
      crosses its path and reach the end boss. The ship has a primary weapon that can be constantly upgraded by
      collecting power-ups, and a secondary slot for all sorts of collectible weapons that can be picked up in mid-air.

      game competition similar to Hudson's Caravan Tournament. The game specifically focuses on beating high scores, and
      as such introduces Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both short segments of shoot-em-up gameplay that challenge
      players to reach a high score (in case of Time Attack, within a limited amount of time). There is also a story
      mode split into two episodes (both based on sci-fi-themed futuristic scenarios); however, there is no actual plot

      Like in most games of the kind, the player controls a spaceship and tries to eliminate or avoid on-screen enemies.
      Power-ups take the shape of the letters A, B, C, and D; each corresponds to a weapon of specific color and
      properties (e.g. spreading fire, side fire, etc.), though they are fairly similar to each other in function. A
      powerful sub-weapon that hits all enemies on screen comes in four variants and can only be used once.</story>

    <story>Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The game
      mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several
      based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be

      computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.

      The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included
      terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the
      grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was
      released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations,
      such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and
      Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members.

      Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their
      general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may
      capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each

    <story>Super Schwarzschild is a spin-off entry in the Schwarzschild series. The game's scenario is based on that of
      Schwarzschild II. The story is much more elaborate and character-specific; unlike the earlier game, there is a
      linear plot advanced through dialogue and anime-style cutscenes. The player takes control of Alcion, the crown
      prince of the Auraclume kingdom, who is forced to terminate his studies abroad and return to his country in order
      to defend it against a treacherous enemy.

      The gameplay system is vastly different as well; as opposed to the main entries in the series, Super Schwarzschild
      is not a grand strategy game. The gameplay is confined to much smaller areas and is also significantly more linear
      and mission-oriented. Rather than presenting free-form gameplay and interaction with a multitude of nations, the
      game is restricted to a single military conflict. Diplomacy options are completely gone; finances, resource
      management, and research have been simplified. Much of the game is dedicated to military strategy and tactics,
      involving arming and deploying ships. Battles are actively controlled by the player; they take place on separate

      Like other Schwarzschild games, it is set in the 40th century and portrays a complex political and military
      situation within a star system. The events of the game take place in or around the once powerful kingdom of
      Istramu, which was severely weakened by the king's death. Temporary leaders replaced each other, and the
      instability led to a global revolt in the surrounding space. The player takes the role of various characters

      model. Similarly to the predecessor, the game features extensive cutscenes and dialogue that advance the plot.

    <story>One night, a lone, grim-looking traveler who calls himself Ax appears in a pub at the outskirts of Satania
      castle. He meets Althea, a girl from a village whose inhabitants were massacred by orcs. The two travel to the

      resurrection of a powerful demon. Ax reveals his own demonic heritage, but is willing to join forces with the
      people of the kingdom and fight against his kin...

      Completely unrelated to an earlier game of the same name, Sword Master is a tactical RPG, i.e. a hybrid of
      Japanese-style RPG and strategic battles. The player controls a small party at first, but later can command
      several units. Most of the gameplay takes place on the battle fields. The player navigates the heroes in
      turn-based fashion, attacking or casting magic when the enemy is in range. Attacks are presented as short
      full-screen animated sequences. Characters gain experience after each attack and might level up in the middle of
      the battle.

      Unlike many other games of this kind, Sword Master contains an additional RPG element in the possibility to
      navigate the characters in real time in towns and other "friendly" areas. The story progression, however, is
      completely linear, and the player can not explore hostile areas.</story>

      Despite its theme and setting, Sylphia plays like a vertically scrolling shooter. As in most games of this kind,
      the gameplay consists of shooting down waves of enemies, on the ground and in the skies. Sylphia can use four
      types of ranged attacks, which roughly correspond to other shooters' traditional weapons: fire blasts, laser,
      spreading fire, homing missiles. These weapons are displayed as colored orbs and must be collected. Power-ups can

    <story>Tadaima Y?sha Bosh?ch? is a semi-humorous title that incorporates elements of role-playing and strategy board
      game. The game is set in a medieval fantasy land populated by various races; when the country is overrun by
      demonic invaders, the king cowardly avoids responsibility and puts the task of liberating it into the hands of a
      group of heroes. Four players (human or AI-controlled) select their characters, each representing an exotic race,
      and take them on a quest to free the land.

      Navigation is done in a board game style; each of the players rolls dice, which determines the amount of moves the
      character can make. Characters belong to different classes and have unique attributes, abilities, hit and magic
      points, etc. In towns the characters can rest, purchase magic spells of various levels and elemental disciplines,
      buy items, and hire companions in bars. These companions also come in many varieties (magic users, monks,
      barbarians, etc.), and it is necessary to create a balanced party with spellcasters, healers and physically tough
      characters to prevail.

      Fields the characters land on may lead to random events such as stats and money increase, as well as battles. The
      latter are handled in traditional Japanese-style, turn-based RPG fashion, viewed from a Final Fantasy-like
      perspective. The player inputs commands (attack, magic, item, etc.) until the enemies are defeated, at which point
      battle spoils are acquired. Towns are often overrun by tougher enemies and can be liberated by vanquishing them.
      Should two player-controlled parties meet each other on the same field, they can opt to fight each other.</story>

      same time, having vacations without practicing will diminish their professional skill. Keeping the right balance

      After a period of training, the player chooses which specific branch he/she wants the girls to compete in:
      commercial photos (model), staging a musical, performing a pop concert, making a movie, etc. Depending on the

      The game is a traditional Japanese-style adventure: no puzzles, but many situations during which the player has to
      make choices. These choices lead to branching story lines, which in their turn lead to different endings. The game

    <story>Originating in the arcades, Dynasty Wars is a beat-em-up set during the Three Kingdoms Era of the Chinese

      the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly
      infantry and archers.

      Four historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei
      (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names
      are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.

      The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system:
      when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in
      order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In
      addition, so-called "tactics" can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the
      protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.

      Stages typically culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure
      that increases the player's score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue orbs,
      which represent the game's light RPG elements: yellow orbs count as experience points and increase the character's
      vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his weapon.</story>

      Travel Eple is a top-down action game similar in concept to Bomberman. The game is divided into stages, each

      regular enemies only have close-range attacks, but bosses may not follow this rule), or by throwing objects at
      her. Eple, on the other hand, has no attacks on her own and must rely on these objects (mostly explosives such as
      bombs and grenades) to hurt the enemy. Objects keep appearing randomly in various parts of the screen as long as

      Stages may contain hazardous areas that damage Eple, or other spots that prevent her from walking around normally.
      Health-restoring pots also pop up from time to time. A few stages require Eple to access a magic staff, which
      grants her various protective abilities (e.g. an ice force field that absorbs fire damage).

      A versus mode is available, in which players compete against each other by controlling Eple and her friend Pal.

    <story>The TV Show is a humorous overhead action game similar to Bomberman in concept. The game consists of a
      scenario mode (single-player) and a versus mode (up to four players). Both modes offer seven characters to choose
      from. The characters are comically-themed and include a hyperactive schoolgirl, an armored ninja, and others.
      There is no real storyline behind these characters; each comes with a short introduction sequence that invariably
      leads to their admittance to an alien-organized TV show, where they have to defeat enemies and retrieve prizes.

      Each stage is an overhead screen containing the protagonist, enemies, the prize, and several bombs. The bombs
      should be picked up and carried around; they are used to deal with enemies and blow up the receptacle in which the
      prize is contained. The green bombs change their color to yellow and red when picked up, at which point they are
      about to explode and have to be thrown to avoid damage. Bombs also blow holes in the terrain, and the player must
      pay attention not to fall through. In addition to bomb-carrying and bomb-throwing, each character possesses a

    <story>Urusei Yatsura: Stay with You is based on the manga series by Rumiko Takahashi. The protagonist is Ataru
      Moroboshi, a high school student who accidentally evokes love in the heart of Lum, the princess of an alien
      demon-like race. The game does not recount the initial events of the manga and instead is built like an episode,
      assuming the player's familiarity with the general story and characters. Ataru's ex-girlfriend Shinobu disappears
      under mysterious circumstances. Ataru and Lum must explore the high school building and find out what happened to
      Shinobu.

      The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure, where all interaction (including navigation) is
      performed by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects from a list. game progression is
      fairly linear, and it is typically required to complete an objective in one location in order to be able to
      proceed to the next one. There are no real puzzles, but an inventory with items that can be examined is present.

    <story>Valis II has the same basic plot as its computer counterpart: Rogles, the tyrant of the magical world
      Vecanti, was defeated, and a new emperor named Megas is terrorizing its inhabitants. It's up to the Japanese
      schoolgirl Yuko to take on her persona of the Valis Soldier and vanquish Megas.

      Gameplay-wise, this version differs from the computer releases significantly. Though it has six stages that end
      with the same boss enemies, its level design, layout, and many regular enemies are different. This release also
      completely removes two key gameplay features of the computer version: the ability to equip different weapons and
      armor, and the flying side-scrolling shooter stages.</story>

    <story>After Yuko has defeated the evil Rogles, peace descended upon Earth and the magical world of Vecanti. But a
      new threat has arisen: an enigmatic man named Glames from the Dark World, possessor of a sword named Leethus, is
      planning to conquer both Earth and Vecanti, convinced that there is no other way to save his world from imminent
      destruction. A young girl from the Dark World named Cham escapes from Glames, and asks Yuko to help her stop him
      with the aid of her Valis sword.

      Like its predecessors in the series, Valis III is a side-scrolling platform action game. Unlike the previous
      installments, the player can control three characters in the game: Yuko, Cham (who uses a whip and fights
      similarly to Castlevania protagonists), and princess Valna from Vecanti, who is weaker physically, but can cast
      more powerful magic. Each of the characters can equip different weapons and has access to her own magic spells.

      Yuko, the former Valis soldier who has now become a goddess, telling her that one of the resistance members, a
      girl named Lena, is the heir to the Valis sword. Lena and her sister Amu decide to rescue Valna and find a way to
      stop Galgear.

      Like its predecessors, Valis IV is an action platformer. It is similar to the previous game in allowing the player
      to control three different characters: Lena, Amu, and Asfal. Each of the characters wields a unique weapon (Valis
      sword for Lena, boomerang for Amu, and lance trident for Asfal) and has access to their own elemental spells
      (thunder for Lena, fire for Amu, ice for Asfal). Each one also has a special ability: Lena can slide through
      narrow passages, Amu can double-jump, and Asfal is immune to certain traps. Along with recovery and
      spell-enhancing (up to three levels) items, characters can also acquire special spheres that increase the overall
      count of their hit- and magic points.</story>

    <story>The governing planet of the Vasteel Solar System is called Belose. Emperors of the Faracia dynasty have been
      ruling the planet for hundreds of years. However, the last emperor turned out to be rather unpopular with the
      people, and they began talking about changing the government system. Unexpectedly, the emperor becomes gravely ill
      and dies soon thereafter. His elder son, Faliall, is proclaimed the heir. However, Faliall's younger brother,
      Stefan, cares for the wishes of the simple folk, and is willing to change things. Hence, the bloody war between
      the two brothers for power and justice begins...

      Vasteel is a hex-based war strategy game in its core. The story mode takes the player (who controls either
      Stefan's or Faliall's armies) through various top-down maps, on which the two armies will try to annihilate each
      other, advance to a better position, conquer enemy cities, etc. There is also a versus mode, which allows
      two-player gameplay, as well as access to all the maps regardless of the story.

      The armies of the two princes are entirely robotic; even tanks, cannons, and spaceships are shaped like
      "transformer" robots. Both armies have factories, which can produce new robots, even several times per turn; each
      such productions costs money, of which there is limited amount. The player navigates the robots in turn-based
      fashion over the map. Combat ensues when two robots are on the same grid.

      Unlike in most games of this kind, the actual battles in Vasteel are interactive and action-based. The players
      must quickly move their robots and shoot at each other. Same applies to robots which enter factories and cities
      with the intention to destroy their protective mechanisms; the defending side uses stationary turrets to fire at
      the robot, while the latter tries to avoid them and get to the core before being destroyed.</story>

    <story>Vasteel 2 is formally a sequel to Vasteel; it is also set in the eponymous fictional, futuristic solar system
      and deals primarily with strategic battles between robots. However, its story is not directly connected with that
      of the predecessor. The main hero is a young boy named Voice Knuckles, who enjoys a peaceful life with his mother
      and his girlfriend Diggy. But the cruel Emperor Agares attacks his planet and destroys Voice's home, killing his
      mother in the process. The boy swears revenge. Aided by his girlfriend and his friends, he assembles a rebel army
      from fighters who navigate giant robots, and is determined to defeat Agares at all costs.

      The game is more story-heavy than its predecessor, and has more clearly pronounced anime/manga aesthetics.
      Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles,
      characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur.

      The gameplay also underwent some changes. Vasteel 2 is, like its predecessor, a hex-based, turn-based strategy
      game with robotic combat; however, the action sequences are gone, and the battles now proceed automatically, as in
      most games of this genre. Robot production and financial management were also simplified or removed. However, the
      player can choose to use various types of weapons before engaging an enemy in combat. For example, robots can use
      melee attacks, bipedal tanks can use different laser beams, etc.</story>

      alter her statistics accordingly to achieve the goal.

      The main activities on work days are divided into three groups: training, working, and learning. The learning
      category is the smallest one, but is also necessary for continuing the girl's normal school life. Training
      includes singing, arts, body building, sports, etc. Part-time jobs such as waitress, cook, private tutor, and even

      A pre-made party of six is available to the player right at the beginning, consisting of characters with generic

    <story>After L'Kbreth's Orb was used to bring peace back to the land of Llylgamyn, a new threat emerges in the

      seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to
      release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.

      Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series,
      abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a
      vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very
      similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have
      been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more
      prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.

      The game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of
      crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be
      encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but

      Another gameplay mode is a quiz featuring questions related to the original series; the player has to choose the
      correct answer among four available ones, and a wrong answer leads to instant Game Over.

      Finally, the so-called "Battle" gameplay mode is a judo fighting game. It plays similarly to other fighting games
      (even with its own story, versus, and two-player modes), but instead of the usual punches, kicks, jumps, and
      special moves, the player is only allowed to execute authentic judo moves and play by the rules. Many moves
      involve rapid pressing of different buttons. The player controls Fujiko, and in the versus mode is able to choose
      to fight fictional champions from the original story line.

      Beside these gameplay modes, the game features an extensive Yawara!-related database, with character profiles,
      information, and even the titular heroine giving a cooking lesson.</story>

    <story>Based on the manga Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl, the game follows the story of Yawara Inokuma, the teenage
      granddaughter of a famous judo master. While she is trying to have an ordinary life, her grandfather insists on
      her studying the martial art of judo, and she has troubles to decide what her goal in life is going to be. The
      game's protagonist is one of the minor characters in the manga, a young journalist named Matsuda. Seeing how
      Yawara effortlessly beats up an assailant on the street, Matsuda decides to find out who the "wonder girl" is,
      feeling that she is going to become a famous sports star.

      The game is what is commonly known as digital comic, i.e. Japanese-style adventure game without puzzles and with
      very limited, basic interaction possibilities. Typically, the player is presented with a few verb commands and
      object sub-menus at every screen, and has to go through them in order to make progress. Animated and voiced
      cutscenes frequently occur in order to advance the narrative.</story>

    <story>Tenka wa Ware ni is based on the Sangokushi manga by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, itself an adaptation of Eiji
      Yoshikawa's re-telling of the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. As such, the
      game includes plot elements and a few characters added by Yoshikawa or Yokoyama, but for the most part remains
      faithful to the general storyline of the Chinese novel and hence to the actual historical events of the Three
      Kingdoms Era.

      The gameplay is similar to that of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, focusing on grand strategy and
      country management as well as on tactical battles. There is no scenario selection, but the player can choose
      between multiple warlords of the three kingdoms. The player then manages the province under control of the
      selected warlord. It is necessary to take care of the population and army, buying provisions, training officers,
      and publishing edicts. Diplomacy plays an important role: pacts and agreements can be made, and it is also
      possible to acquire new allies through various means.

      Invading (or being attacked by) another country leads to a large-scale tactical battle that takes place on
      hexagonal grids. The player navigates army divisions in turn-based fashion. Contact with an enemy division leads
      to yet another sub-mode, where the player controls units that form the division, positioning and navigating them
      on a smaller battle screen. The game also has a separate battle mode accessible from the main menu, where the
      player can recreate historical battles directly without going through grand strategy portions.</story>

    <story>Ys: Book I &amp; II contains enhanced remakes of two games: Ys: The Vanished Omens and its sequel, Ys II:
      Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter. The enhanced versions were not released separately.

      The players controls a young red-haired hero named Adol Christin, whose task is to find the six books of Ys, an
      ancient paradise-like land that mysteriously disappeared long time ago. It is said that whoever possesses the six
      books can gain access into Ys. In the first game, Adol is on the quest to find the books and to enter Ys. The
      second game takes place in Ys itself, and Adol must defeat an even greater evil and liberate the land.

      This release features enhanced CD-quality sound, higher-quality graphics, and new anime-style cutscenes.</story>

      the cause of this new evil.

      Ys III: Wanderers from Ys breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games,
      allowing Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions. Beside changing the battle system, the game's
      perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has
      the ability to jump now. New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up
      abilities such as healing and shielding. The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor
      puzzles and progress the story.</story>

    <story>The Dawn of Ys is one of two games released under the title of Ys IV, the other being Tonkin House's Ys IV:
      Mask of the Sun. The two games share the same basic story, but have many differences regarding concrete events,
      locations, gameplay details, etc. The events of the game take place a short while after those described in Ys II,
      and before the events of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys.

      As the game begins, Adol and his friend return to the town of Minea, where the first game began. The evil Lord
      Darm has been defeated, and it's time to relax and spend some time with friends - but not for long. A new evil is
      rising, and Adol decides to set sail for the overseas land of Celceta to investigate these occurrences.

      Ys IV returns to the style of play used in the first and second games. The gameplay area is viewed from a top-down
      perspective, and the player attacks enemies by running into them to cause damage. Combat is slightly more
      sophisticated than in the first two games, since Adol can now move in eight directions, and attacking enemies
      diagonally or from the sides is more efficient than bumping into them headstrong. Adol gains experience from
      defeating enemies, which serves to raise his attack and defense power, like in the previous games. He can equip
      various swords, armor, shields, and rings to enhance his attributes. The magic system introduced in Ys II is also
      brought back for this game.</story>

    <story>Ankoku Bujutsukai is based on the manga Y? Y? Hakusho, which tells the story of a young delinquent named
      Yusuke Urameshi who dies and becomes reincarnated as a reward for a good deed he committed, further serving as an
      "underworld detective" and solving demon-related mysteries. This adaptation of the manga follows the "Dark
      Tournament" story arc, where members of Yusuke's team confront the powerful demon Toguro.

      Despite its premise, which is reminiscent of a versus fighting game, Ankoku Bujutsukai is an arcade-style shooter.
      The player selects one of the five characters (Yusuke, Hiei, Kurama, Kuwabara or Genkai), and is then taken to a
      series of one-on-one shoot-outs in a pre-determined order. The enemy is viewed from a first-person perspective,
      and the player moves a cursor to aim and shoot. The gameplay system is fairly simple, allowing the player to
      execute three types of attacks: regular shots, charged shots, and special attacks of limited quantity. Points are
      received for winning fights and can be used to raise the characters' hit points, speed, or number of special
      moves.</story>

    <story>Kager? no Toki follows Yasha Enbukyoku as the next game in the Zan series.

      Unlike the previous game, Kager? no Toki contains no supernatural forces (demons), and instead focuses on concrete
      events of the Sengoku period in Japan, more exactly 16th century, a period of Japanese history that was marked by
      continuous wars and famous leaders such as Oda Nobunaga or Tokugawa Ieyasu.

      The game offers more strategic possibilities than the previous installments of the series. Choosing a region of
      Japan and its leader, the player can perform a variety of activities, both in his country and towards other
      leaders. Diplomacy includes negotiation, signing contracts and peace treaties, etc.

      Battles are also more in-depth than before; instead of semi-automatic encounters battles occur on a separate map,
      on which the player has to actively navigate his unit, before he engages the enemy in close combat.</story>

      The game is very similar to its predecessor in concept, but offers additional options in the story mode. Part-time
      jobs now include delivery assignments that play like overhead racing games, as well as tending to dogs of various
      breeds for money. The security guard assignment plays like a mini-RPG, complete with turn-based combat, experience
      points, and levels. In addition, it is possible to visit racing tracks and bet money on participants. The versus
      mode allows players to choose between three courses to compete in, racing against each other (in a top-down mode)

    <story>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after
      its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

      Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue
      (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected
      sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then
      throw him against his peers, destroying them.

      The game (more precisely, the European PAL version of it) is known for being the origin of the grammatically
      incorrect phrase in the English translation, All your base are belong to us, which has since become an internet
      phenomenon.</story>
