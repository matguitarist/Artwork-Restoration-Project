		<story>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat
			and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons
			(basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the
			time.

			The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart
			it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes
			you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</story>

		<story>WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game merges the personalities and action of the popular WWF TV show
			characters with a Mortal Kombat-style fighting game. This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF
			superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam
			Bigelow, and Lex Luger.

			Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very
			fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like
			a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other
			wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament
			mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.</story>
