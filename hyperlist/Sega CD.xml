			is determined to have a good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However
			Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it.

			The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight
			year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he'll have to deal
			with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure
			Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded.

			The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a
			certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a
			bar which shows Willy's relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are
			resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to
			a military school and the game is lost.</story>

		<story>Batman Returns on the SEGA CD is an enhanced version of the Genesis adaptation of the movie. It includes
			the entirety of the original platform game, but adds all-new driving levels.

			The game can be played in three ways: either as only the platform game, only the racing game, or a
			combination of both. Each option features a unique ending sequence.

			For every of the original version's five platform levels, there is a related driving section in which the
			player controls either the Batmobile or the Batskiboat. Both in perspective and gameplay, these sections are
			reminiscent of arcade titles like OutRun. Seen from above and behind, the player's vehicle must reach
			checkpoints before a timer runs out, receiving bonus points for any surplus seconds. The CD system's
			hardware is used for sprite scaling and other tricks, achieving a 3D effect.

			The game being based on an action-filled movie, there's not only driving but also shooting: both the car and
			the boat are armed with machine guns and heat-seeking missiles (with limited ammunition). Besides the roads
			being full of enemies in general, each level also ends in a boss fight against a big (and usually heavily
			armed) vehicle.

			The game features CD-based audio tracks, replacing those from the original.</story>

			Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The

		<story>300 years ago, the high priest of the Kingdom of Cheshire tried to disturb the balance of good and evil
			by summoning the dark god Arliman. Sabrina, Goddess of Light, saved the Kingdom by giving great powers to
			two of Cheshire's leaders who defeated the high priest and helped the King's high wizard to entrap Arliman
			in a magical jewel. Velonese, the high wizard's apprentice, was given the task of guarding the imprisoned
			Arliman on the Island of Raven. Over the years, his anger towards the kingdom grew and now he is commanding
			four generals to conquer Cheshire while he is trying to free Arliman.

			You take on the role of one of four playable main characters and must re-conquer the land that has already
			fallen into Velonese's hands and find a way to defeat him and prevent Arliman's resurrection. The four main
			characters feature largely different stories, however, every game begins with the King's death and your
			character becoming the new ruler of Cheshire.

			The most important part of the game takes place on various hex maps where you are fighting your enemies in
			turn-based tactical combat. During these battles your main character - provided he is standing on a
			castle-field - can summon various monsters like serpents, manticors, harpies etc. or hire human
			troops(Humans, Dwarfs, Elves and Hobbits). Monsters need magic points to be summoned, whereas humans have to
			be paid with tax money. Depending on which main character you have chosen, your amount of MP and tax money
			will vary, as well as the types of monsters you will be able to summon. Your troops, including your main
			character, gain experience points and humans can even adopt several different jobs (Priest, Mage, Ninja ...)
			through gaining classes. Your units can also enter towns during battles, to buy weapons and items, hear the
			latest gossip and maybe even discover a side-quest.
			In-between battles, you can equip your troops, send out search parties and allocate troops to different
			towns, as they can be re-conquered by the enemy.

			Also noteworthy are Dark Wizard's long animated cutscenes with spoken dialogues and it's high quality
			orchestral soundtrack.</story>

			does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world
			has also changed and Los Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a remnant
			of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent to capture Phoenix.

			Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective

			"cryocons" released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a

			Atreides family agrees on moving, as he who controls the spice, controls the universe.

			The player arrives in Arrakis with the mission of contacting and convincing the Fremen tribes residing in

			and ornis to protect them from the gigantic protectors of the planet: Shai-Hulud - the sandworms.

			However, the spice doesn't last forever and new sietches must be prospected before having a mining crew

			For those, Fremen tribes can be assigned to military training with Gurney Halleck, but before doing such
			work Paul must have a certain reputation, gained by the control of Arrakis.

			As the game advances, the player will untap Paul's latent powers, as well as meeting other characters from

			special ability.

			The game starts in the area surrounding a save point. This area functions as a central hub to access all the

			points start diminishing until the character dies. Food can be found as potions or pots around the mazes.
			Returning the character to the save point area replenishes all the counters and cures all conditions (like
			poisoning and confusion). To the north there are two buildings, a weapon shop and a tavern. The gold
			collected on the game is spent on equipment upgrades at the weapons shop. The tavern (called Jojo's Bar)
			allows the player to switch characters.

			The characters level up automatically as they amass the necessary experience points. Once a dungeon boss is

			Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature: Flink's ability to create spells.
			Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be
			collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in
			treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the "recipes" which are contained in scrolls that are given
			to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for
			example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick
			grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open
			locked treasure chests and more.
			Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating
			enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only
			limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life.</story>

			Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come
			together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything.

			Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's
			hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit
			each of these worlds to collect the god's weapons.

			The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard
			itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.

			When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games
			determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up
			his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the
			better ones will not be available to you.

			The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock
			by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit
			drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and
			hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the
			other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).

			Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies
			(in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.</story>

			strategy board game based on the works of cartoonist Hisaichi Ishii. The player takes the role of a budding
			politician who must work his way up to become the Prime Minister of Japan.

			The game is completely menu driven, with the player choosing actions for each day as the game progresses,
			such as visiting a certain place or meeting with a specific person. The ultimate goal is to gain experience
			solving citizens' problems and earn enough popularity campaigning -- or by using items to swing public

		<story>In the early nineties, the Jaguar XJ220 was the fastest serial-produced car ever. Core Design acquired
			the right to build a game around it, in a move to counter Gremlin's immensely successful Lotus series.

			Just like Lotus, Jaguar XJ200 is a view from behind racer. There are 32 tracks all over the world, with
			varying road conditions and animated weather conditions such as rain and fog in England, snow in
			Switzerland, and tumbleweed crossing the street in Egypt. You race your Jaguar in a constructor grand prix,
			with opponents running for Porsche, Ferrari and other famous makers. Between races, you must mend the damage
			your car has sustained, which eats up your prize money. Background music is selected through a dashboard CD
			player, which also features some rather uninspiring radio stations.

			The game can also be played in a two-player split-screen mode and features a track editor for when you tire

		<story>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen
			King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for
			Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of
			primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.

			With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a
			guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a
			human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as
			mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and
			while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5,
			reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe
			starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started
			the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

			While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are
			platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in
			typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after
			collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first
			hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.

			The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all
			involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four
			different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach
			(Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and
			reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third
			person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of
			enemies in a VR tunnel).</story>

			features FMV with real video of the actual TV show. The footage is spliced from nine different episodes and
			the gameplay is reminiscent of games such as Dragon's Lair and Space Ace where the player must press a
			button at a certain time to avoid being punched, kicked, avoid a trap, etc. Failure to miss pressing a

		<story>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years,
			was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung. Shang was accompanied by Prince
			Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in
			a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness,
			Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme
			as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near,
			Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor,
			Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special
			Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin
			Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

			Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each
			player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the
			opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the
			loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked
			finale.

			Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to
			represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</story>

			checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper

		<story>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the
			original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd,
			or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross
			the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If
			you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place.

			There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley.
			Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way,
			there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them,
			and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too
			many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are
			riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times -
			but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash
			cup.

			There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You
			start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes
			from a different bike class.

			If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between
			this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you
			are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start
			all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.

			The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs
			performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver.
			These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</story>

			that is based on the FASA RPG of the same name and has only very little to do with its much more popular
			brethren for SNES and Genesis.

			It is twenty-first century, and the humanity faces a difficult period that follows devastating wars and
			other disasters. Magic and technology co-exist, supernatural powers, mythical creatures, ghosts, cyberspace,
			where hackers meet and fight each other, street deckers which can be hired to do the dirty work, anarchy and
			struggle between mighty and corrupt corporation - this is the world of Shadowrun. Unlike the two other
			Shadowrun games which are set in Seattle, according to tradition, "Shadowrun" for Sega CD is set in the
			futuristic Neo Tokyo. You control a party of characters with different backgrounds: the street samurai
			Rikudo, the shaman girl Mao, the decker (a hired mercenary) D-Head who also happens to be an elf, and Shiun,
			a former member of a mighty corporation. Your first assignment is to hunt down a ghostly warrior who has
			been disturbing the piece of the city for quite some time. As you begin your investigation, you plunge
			deeper into the dark work of intrigues and find yourself fighting on different fronts.

			"Shadowrun" for Sega CD (unlike its two other counterparts) is a distinctly Japanese game. It is a hybrid of
			Japanese adventure along the lines of Snatcher and turn-based party RPG. In adventure mode, you interact
			with the game world by choosing commands ("Look", "Talk", "Move", etc.) from a menu. There are no real
			puzzles, but rather realistic detective work: you talk to people, gather evidence, access the internet, talk
			to informers, and so on. But often you find yourself in places where you navigate your characters from a
			top-down view and fight enemies. The battles occupy the whole screen, and you can move around the battle
			field, using melee, long-ranged, and magic attacks, like in early Ultima games. The outcome of an attack is
			decided by a dice roll. You can stop the dices yourself, or you can let the computer do the rolling for you.
			There are also cyberspace fights which occur when you encounter a hostile hacker in the matrix world.

			everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

			important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

			It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim

		<story>Vay is the story of Prince Sandor of Lorath, and his quest to avenge the assassination of his parents and
			rescue his beloved Lady Elin. On what is to be the day of their wedding, Castle Lorath is assaulted by the
			Danek, who have been able to partially reconstruct alien mecha technology from a millennium ago. The castle
			defenses are powerless against the giant robots, and the king and queen are killed in the attack. The
			invaders steal Elin in the midst of her wedding vows. Prince Sandor, now the king of the realm, sets out to
			rescue his betrothed, and find a way to defeat the fearsome alien technology.

			The game is a thoroughly "old-school" Japanese-style RPG, meaning that the focus of the game is on fighting
			random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining experience and gold in process, without any additional
			gimmicks. The characters come with pre-set "classes" (wizard, bard, etc.), and learn their own
			abilities/magic spells automatically as they level up.</story>

		<story>Wakusei Woodstock: Funky Horror Band est un RPG de 5 chapitres que l'on pourrait qualifier de "RPG

			Le Funky Horror Band est un groupe de six musiciens extraterrestres qui propagent un message de paix et
			d'amour Ã  travers les styles intemporels de la musique des annÃ©es 80. Cependant, aprÃ¨s ils sont chassÃ©s de
			leur planÃ¨te d' Horahora, leur fusÃ©e s'Ã©crase sur une autre planÃ¨te, oÃ¹ un jeune garÃ§on du village voisin de
			Funky trouve l'Ã©pave et la bande Ã  l'intÃ©rieur. Ils doivent travailler ensemble pour rÃ©parer le vaisseau de
			la bande... et leurs instruments , bien sÃ»r! Ce jeu s'apparente Ã  des JRPG style Dragon Quest, mais il n'y a
			pas de systÃ¨me d'expÃ©rience ou de niveau, la customisation des personnages est limitÃ©e Ã  changer
			l'Ã©quipement, et certaines histoires sont prÃ©sentÃ©s comme des visuals novels.</story>

			teleport if you press down. Other boxes contain items. You also can sketch things and they will come to
