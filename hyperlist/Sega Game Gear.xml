			from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons.

			There are three main modes:

			1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps.

			2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that
			affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining
			modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There
			are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and
			get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top
			spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this
			mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars
			frequently.

			3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions.
			There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is
			a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps
			(between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).

			While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup
			options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against
			16 drivers. The car can be instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.</story>

Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).

The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</story>

			the gems of the rainbow in order to confront and defeat the witch.

			in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them around
			also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right spot and jumping off of them, he can

			mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While
			the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a
			non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP

			creation, players can choose the fighter's head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental

			attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite
			punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches, career mode
			offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.

			Cloud Castle's tower.

			The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual
			scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the
			character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such
			as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone.

			Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple
			puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies
			avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle.
			Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower.</story>

			all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems
			with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.

			The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for
			better-than-minimum system

			FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian
			league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured,
			and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also
			choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied
			with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team

			crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is
			based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be
			pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay
			can be selected.

			Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when
			near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep

		<story>In this game you play the role of a surfer called Greendog who discovers a gold pendant while out
			surfing. Unwittingly he puts the pendant on and discovers it wont come off. A bikini clad girl tells him
			that the pendant was made by the Aztecs long ago, and that they cursed it so that whoever wears it will be
			attacked by any animal that comes near them. Worst of all the person wearing it is unable to surf. The only
			way Greendog can lift the curse and remove the pendant is to find the six pieces of Aztec treasure and put
			them all together and the only knowledge of the whereabouts of the treasure is stamped on the back of the
			pendant.

			The gameplay involves you getting from the left end of the level to the right while fighting off wild
			animals with your trusty Frisbee and using your athletic skills to jump over platforms.</story>

			Halley Wars is a vertical scrolling shooter. The game has 6 stages set in locations in space such as, above

			weaknesses. There are power-ups, which can be picked up along the way when you shoot particular asteroids or

			Where the game stood out was, there are comets that need to be destroyed on your journey. Each comet and

			ships do. If Earths damage level reaches 100% the game is over. For every 2000 points you score, 1% of

		<story>Head Buster is a so-called ”future sports” game about robots. On a top-down, horizontally scrolling
			playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games, albeit
			without many of the refinements of that series.

			Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped according to your tastes and
			finances. After that, the game begins in the robot arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The
			goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order to
			reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain amount of fighting is required. Each
			turn is split into a movement phase and a combat phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed
			when a phase is over, you cannot know when moving how close you will get to your opponents.

			Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be modified with new movement
			units (different terrain squares have different movement properties), better armour and new weapons.
			Different weapons have both different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets.
			Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays out of combat during that
			turn. Different sensors and command units can also be added, giving the robots better aim or particular
			abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.</story>

		<story>The Game Gear version of Kinetic Connection has been rearranged a lot from the original version released
			5 years earlier to cope with a smaller screen and Sega's taste in motifs.

			As the original version, Kinetic Connection is a jigsaw puzzle game, where the pieces are animated. This
			makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more difficult,
			since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about. Pieces
			also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit together.

			The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones
			designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of
			the screen as in the original Kinetic; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random
			order. Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:

			Mode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece and lets the player slide
			pieces around as in a sliding puzzle. Mode 3 lets the player slide entire rows and columns around in the
			puzzle. The two second modes call for much more thought when solving the moving puzzles.</story>

		<story>Revelations: The Demon Slayer is a side-game (gaiden) of the Megami Tensei (Megaten) universe. Unlike all
			other Megaten games, this game is not set in modern-day or futuristic Japan. On a distant planet, a race
			resembling humans possess the ability to call upon a power called Gaia. The player takes the role of a young
			boy who learns the arts of Gaia. However, the land is in danger - an evil force is approaching. Assisted by
			his friends, the hero has to summon an army of demons and lead them in a war against the evil.

			Like in all other Megaten games, the player can summon demons and fuse them, getting more powerful variants.

		<story>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it
			would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of
			Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind
			those earthquakes.

			Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play
			with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help
			them in several tasks.

			Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean
			the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must
			clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

			After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For
			instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among
			the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

			Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and
			character.</story>

		<story>If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro
			Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across
			a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit,
			Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

			These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open
			to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table.
			Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The
			desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the
			open homework.

			Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you
			race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount
			of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every
			third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in
			a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.

			The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one
			car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it
			reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if
			3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play
			off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to
			Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.</story>

			Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special
			Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin
			Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

			Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each
			player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the
			opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the
			loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked
			finale.

			Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to
			represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</story>

			out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes
			four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:

			1. "Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making

			Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are
			instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that
			knocks all other players to the ground.

			"Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.

			"Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all
			the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also

			involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a
			terrifying evil upon the world.

			Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He
			can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to
			toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

			Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads,
			and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen --
			through which the storyline unfolds.</story>

		<story>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason
			enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly
			babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to
			Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy
			caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen
			through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!

			The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno
			through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and
			finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his
			trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like
			out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies
			are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can -
			depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly,
			boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more.

			Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to
			a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But,
			unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by
			completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for
			the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game
			are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.</story>

		<story>Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many
			block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

			The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two
			blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's
			directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you
			place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his
			direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game
			ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear
			approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top
			of them will drop.

			Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many
			versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.

			The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no
			more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can
			change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.

			All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</story>

			Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve
			some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives,

			An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

			The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis

			racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular
			road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

			By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better
			bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose
			valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is
			possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

		<story>This is not a sequel to the game Shining Force: The Legacy of Great Intention for Genesis, but a sequel
			to a Shining Force Gaiden, which was released only in Japan.

			After a prolonged war, the kingdoms of Cypress and Gardiana decided to join forces fighting the evil empire
			of Iom. Nick, the Prince of Cypress, that was conquered by Iom, had his hand turned into stone during the
			last battle, and therefore cannot wield his legendary Sword of Hajya. Nevertheless, he tries to recruit
			people who would help him to gain his kingdom back.

			The game is a strategy RPG. You command a large party composed of several units, and most of the game is
			spent in battles. The turn-based battles occupy the entire location; during your turn, you command your
			troops to move around and to attack. Your main heroes gain levels in a RPG fashion.</story>

			kidnaps Anri, the princess of Gardiana, casting a spell on her that envelops her in dark fog. You control
			Nick, a young prince who decides to help the princess, aided by the warrior team of the first Shining Force.

			The game is a strategy RPG with a typical Shining Force-style combat: the largest part of the game is spent
			fighting enemy forces. You move your party (up to twelve characters) around, attacking or casting spells.
			Once in contact with the enemy, a short automatic battle sequence occurs. You gain experience points for

		<story>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from
			the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

			On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are
			planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough
			"proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members
			will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since
			the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants,
			Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

			The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the
			first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even
			involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

			Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting
			devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.</story>

			instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a
			level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone
			is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from

		<story>Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek movie and its story: Captains Kirk and Picard must
			team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an inhabited planet so that he might reenter the mysterious
			Nexus energy ribbon.

			The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the
			Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon
			torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its
			destination by flying through rectangles in space.

			On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can
			fire your phaser at enemies.

			Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by
			putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game
			reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place.
			Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.

			The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built
			on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't
			always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.</story>

		<story>This game is based closely on Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. It combines a number of gameplay styles,
			but primarily it is a side scrolling run-and-jump platformer.

			The game begins on Tatooine, where you, as Luke Skywalker, must travel around and meet up with R2D2, C3PO,
			Obi-Wan, and so on. Eventually, you travel through Mos Eisley and the Death Star as well. While most of the
			game has you controlling Luke, Han or Leia directly, some of the various game styles include a first-person
			Millennium Falcon asteroid belt sequence, and an overhead view Death Star trench run.</story>

		<story>The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D Tetris. Players drop tiles
			into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles
			simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The
			player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of
			a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.

			There are two game modes building on this basic concept:

			1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can
			before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.

			Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In
			Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height
			level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates.
			You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult
			for them) or by being the first to complete the address.</story>

			tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain it's power. Tails gears up

			finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While resting there, a large explosion occurs
			and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.

			Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much

			on ledges and throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be replenished with rings, but the

		<story>The Game Gear version of the grand old lady of war simulations, Daisenryaku, arranges a war between the
			fictive Red and Blue countries. On one of thirty different maps, units are produced and moved out into
			combat, and the war is only over when the enemy capital has been conquered.

			Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Each city or airbase within a
			distance of five hexagons from your capital may produce one unit each turn, as long as your funds allow it.
			Each turn yields new funds, whose amount is proportional to the number of cities and airports you have
			occupied.

			Units are moved on the map, which is based on "fake hexagons"; the hexagons are in fact square, but offset
			on each row so that each square borders six other squares. Each terrain type has different movement and
			defence values, which makes movement and combat more complicated.

			The outcome of combat is determined by the attack strength which varies between different unit types, and by
			their experience. Each time a unit survives combat, it gains experience points and eventually gains in
			experience level, which makes the chance of winning in combat higher. As each unit is in fact a squadron of
			ten, a typical combat will only destroy a certain number of the members of the unit.

			An additional moment in the gameplay is the recharging phase. Units which have lost members can be built up
			to full force in a city or airbase, and those which have run out of ammunition can do the same. Ammunition
			can also be replenished in the battlefield using supply trucks.

			A total of thirteen airbourne and land-based units are available. Some units cannot fight other units; tanks
			can do nothing against bombers, and mechanised infantry can't protect itself well against a howitzer two
			squares away.

			The game can be played both against the computer or against another human player by linking two Game Gears
			together.</story>

		<story>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with
			it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty
			shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of
			them must be completed in one sitting.

			The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics
			engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster and farther
			but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed
			down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the
			ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game
			allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to
			belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.

			Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be
			tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field.

			The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.

			has two game modes: story and versus.

			In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style cutscenes before and after each
			fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of them corresponding to one fight. The player starts
			controlling Akira Yuki, as as he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so they can be
			chosen in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available are Pai Chan, Jacky
			Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau Chan. In the final act, the player must fight
			against Dural.

			The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters to fight against the CPU. In
			the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed from the character selection.

			The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode
			shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger sprites). The
			Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter games, alternating between
			the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro sequence, with anime style cutscenes.

			In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting game, as the player can
			perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up), as well as some special maneuvers. The Game
			Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in the Master System version. The fights are
			regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this three possibilities happen:
			their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have less energy than the opponent if the time
			runs out.</story>

			With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out
			in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit "mystery bricks",
			wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your
			path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of
			this kind – instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might
			bounce back in the corners.

			Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this
			game less linear than usual.

			Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from
			other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the "diamond ball", which destroys all blocks in its
			path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them
			to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits bricks with more power, thereby destroying
			brick with one hit that would otherwise have required several.</story>

		<story>X-Men is a sidescrolling beat'em up/platform game, much like its homonymous Mega Drive/ Genesis
			counterpart. Several X-Men characters are playable throughout the game. The player can choose from two
			characters from the start, Cyclops and Wolverine, and three Levels are accessible. In the course of the
			game, the player can unlock five other X-Men, namely Storm, Iceman, Rogue, Nightcrawler and Psylocke.

			The story is that most of the X-Men have been kidnapped by Magneto, which is the reason why only Cyclops and
			Wolverine are available from the start. Apparently, unlocking the characters equals rescuing him. On the
			way, there several foes from the X-Men universe to beat, and at the end, Magneto once again needs a
			reprehension.

			The basic mechanics of the game are punching, (double-)jumping and jump-kicking. Furthermore, pressing Start
			activates/ deactivates the characters mutant ability, for example Wolverine's claws or Cyclops' laser beams.
			Using it however drains a limited amount of energy, which can be refreshed by finding "X"-symbols.</story>

		<story>In a dark future, Mojo has his own TV show where the participants fight to death. He has imprisoned some
			X-Men from the past to recreate their greatest battles. Wolverine and Rogue have to enter the game and
			rescue their friends, then defeating Mojo to return back home.

			In this platform game, the player starts choosing either Wolverine or Rogue. At each new level beaten, a new
			X-Men will be available: first Gambit, then Cyclops, Havoc and finally Shard. If one of the X-Men dies, the
			player has to start the level again, choosing among the remaining X-Men the one to play. After all the X-Men
			have died, the game is over.

			Each character can activate his/her power at will. Wolverine can use his claws, Rogue can fly, Gambit can
			throw explosive cards, Cyclops will fire optic blasts, Havoc fires plasma blasts and Shard fires energy
			blasts. The characters have an energy meter and a power meter, which will worn out as they are hit or use
			their powers, respectively. They can find items to restore their energy and power.

			Gameplay consists basically in finding the way out of each of the six levels. Once finding it, the character
			will face a boss, usually known characters from the comics like Magneto, Fitzroy, a Sentinel, etc. The last
			boss is Mojo himself.</story>
