		<story>Crush Roller is a game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color based on the 1981 arcade game Make Trax, which was
			released as Crush Roller in Europe and Asia.

			The object of the game is to color the entire maze-like playing field with a paint brush. While you paint,
			two enemies walk around in the maze, when they hit you, you lose a life.

			A level has rollers which you can push forward with your paint brush. If you capture an enemy in the path of
			the roller he dies and is temporarily taken out of the game. This scores you extra points. Each subsequent
			enemy rolled over is worth more points.

			Every once in a while another creature will pop up, it will run around leaving behind track marks in your
			paint. Painting over this creature removes it from the game and scores you additional points. His tracks
			have to be repainted.

			When the entire maze is painted you win the level. Unlike the original arcade version the Neo Geo Pocket
			Color version has multiple levels.</story>

			who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

			Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red
			ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One
			touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

			Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During
			this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited
			amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man
			again.

			Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.

		<story>Picture Puzzle (Oekaki Puzzle in Japan) is a paint-by-numbers puzzle game developed by Success for the
			Neo Geo Pocket Color. The game plays identical to Nintendo's Picross series. Picture Puzzle offers a total
			of 200 puzzles: 20 5x5 puzzles, 105 10x10's, and 75 15x15's. This is biased towards smaller puzzles because
			the grids in anything larger would be incredibly tiny on the NGPC's screen. Also, larger puzzles take much
			longer to solve; smaller puzzles allows you to pick up the Pocket for 10-20 minutes at a time and, on a good
			day, solve a complete puzzle.

			Upon completion of a puzzle, the game replaces it with a colored version of the same grid and gives it a
			title. Especially with the smaller puzzles, this is helpful in that it is sometimes otherwise unclear as to
			what exactly the completed picture is supposed to be. Because it colorizes them, the game requires the Neo
			Geo Pocket Color, i.e, it won't run on a monochrome Neo Geo Pocket.</story>

		<story>Super Real Mahjong Premium Collection es la primera entrega port√°til de la serie Super Real Mahjong. Como
			de costumbre, juegas strip mahjong con chicas guapas, esta vez varias de muchos de los juegos. Sin embargo,
			debido a las limitaciones del sistema, solo algunas escenas de tira est√°n animadas. Tambi√©n tiene algunas
			cualidades similares a las de una novela visual, en particular un modo historia en el que intentas
			concentrarte en una chica cada vez que se juega. Esto se logra eligiendo las opciones correctas cuando se le
			presentan. Si logras concentrarte en una sola chica, su CG se desbloquea en la galer√≠a.</story>
