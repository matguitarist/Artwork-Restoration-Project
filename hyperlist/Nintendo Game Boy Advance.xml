      Puzzle Challenge a few years back. The GBA version is also enhanced for the GBA's much more capable graphics

      Set in New York, Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace enables players to assume the role of Spider-Man as they take on
      super-villain Mysterio and his illusory tricks for control of Manhattan. Spider-Man must fight a slew of

      mind-warping grip.

      X2 - Wolverine's Revenge

      During the 1960's, a Canadian named Logan was used in a government-conducted experiment known as Weapon X.
      Unbreakable adamantium was ingested into his bones, in an attempt to turn him into a "super-soldier". For the rest
      of his life, Logan (who adopted the nickname Wolverine) will have to fight against the beast inside him. Only
      after meeting Professor Xavier and his X-Men team, Wolverine is able to find a purpose in his life. However, as
      his memories return, he realizes that the Weapon X experiment has infected him with a deadly virus, and he has
      only two days to find the cure.</story>

      live action. It first plays from an overhead view of an Amusement Park where you can enter open doors which lead
      to 12 different themed worlds. Each world is a 2D side-scrolling platformer, where you face different enemies and
      end-level bosses all in your quest to find the Gold Amulet. Once you finish a certain number of the levels, you'll
      be rewarded with one of two mini-games. One is a target range where you have to shoot a number of enemies within a
      certain time. The other is a strength test where Ace must swing to hit a bell at the top of a pole.</story>

      It also replaces the "juice meter" with the so-called "grind meter" which is filled up by performing stunts. Every

      In Asterix and Cleopatra, Asterix has to help a Egyptian architect Artifis to build his pyramid for Cleopatra. You
      play typical platform levels where you jump around obstacles and walk towards the right of the screen. Many
      enemies such as fake building contractors and Roman soldiers (sent by a jealous Caesar), and pirates have to be

      However, because Atomic Betty is aimed at a younger audience, there are two notable differences: first, it is a
      lot more difficult to die, and second, the player only needs to get one character to the exit to successfully
      finish the level. When on Earth, the player controls one character that can finish the homework, one that can push
      or pull objects, and the last that can slide under narrow gaps.

      In Space, one character can repeatedly attack and use special gadgets, one can use a jetpack for a very high jump,
      and the last can grab items and enemies. In addition to the main levels, the game also features levels where the
      player must control the spaceship as it zooms through asteroid belts and high-speed space warps.</story>

    <story>Azumanga Daioh Advance can be seen as a kind of card game. The cards are given out in increments of five.
      These cards have stars on them and each card number has a certain number of these stars. The aim is to put as many
      stars as possible, shown on the cards in your hand, to connect together to form a combo or 'link'. The higher the
      combo you achieve, the more points you will achieve against your opponent, thus depleting their health bar. The
      games are short and can last for around 5 turns, with each turn going for close to fifteen seconds.</story>

    <story>Bibi Blocksberg is the star of a German children's radio play and TV series. She is an apprentice witch,
      living in the common world of today, who has to live through different adventures.

      The story: During a witch meeting, a lightning bolt struck and broke a crystal ball in seven parts, causing the
      witches to go mad. Bibi Blocksberg now has find all the parts to put them together and to restore the witches'
      mental health.

      The game is an action-adventure. The seven levels, each corresponding to one witch and one part of the crystal
      ball, are full of monsters which hurt Bibi when she touches them. The health can be restored by finding sweets
      hidden in the level. Apart of monsters, there are persons which help her. In each level there is a magical item,
      often reachable only after getting through a little "game in game", that expands Bibi's magical powers, for
      example the broom that allows her to fly. The magic has to be used sparsely, because it costs magical energy,
      which can be recharged by finding little pulsating dots. This magical item is needed to get to the witch of the
      level, which Bibi has to fight. If she wins, the witch gets back to normal, gives her a part of the crystal ball
      and Bibi can go the the next level.

      There also is a password system that allows the player to jump to different situations in the game, so that one
      does not have to play it through in one session.</story>

    <story>In the GBA version of Bionicle Heroes, based on the LEGO Bionicle franchise, players take on the guise of the
      TOA Anika team. Set on the island of Voya Nui, they need to retrieve the Mask of Life, stolen by the Piraka race
      who also enslaved the Matoran, the native inhabitants, in the process. Unlike the console and the DS versions, a
      top-down perspective is used.

      The game takes place on six zones of the island, followed by a final showdown. The player starts as a TOA of Fire,
      but by completing zones and killing the level boss, additional masks can be collected: Air, Stone, Ice, Earth and
      Water. Each TOA has a primary and secondary weapon based on the mask's elemental nature, with specific features.
      During the levels, there are also weapon upgrades to be found. The second weapon is limited by an energy meter
      which needs some time to recharge. Each zone requires a specific TOA guise, but in the Free Play mode completed
      levels can be revisited and players can then switch between the forms at any time to use different abilities. TOAs
      can strafe while fighting - there is an option to face enemies automatically or to control this manually.

      TOAs are assisted by proto-spawn orbs, sidekicks that circle around the hero and fire at enemies. The orbs are
      chased off when they take too much damage, but they can also be upgraded based on the 6 elements and the weapons
      can be customized. Players can define to have the orbs fire in spread patterns or rapid bursts, lock on targets
      with fire, cause explosions, fire through shields or do double damage. Additional attacks are provided through
      elemental runes, which provide a one-time limited effect, such as freezing enemies, activating a lightning shield,
      smashing enemies with spikes from the ground, temporary invulnerability, full health and regeneration, and a fire
      blast.

      By destroying objects and buildings in the environment, blue, gray or gold LEGO pieces are revealed, providing
      health and bonus points. The TOAs also need to use pieces to build bridges, platforms, elevators, turrets,
      barricades or moving platforms. At the end of each zone, the rank and score is shown. Based on the performance or
      specific actions, there are 12 medals to collect, of which a few can only be found in the Free Play mode.

      Each zone contains secret cheat words. Upon discovering them, they are added to a cheat menu. They allow to play
      as a golden TOA or to obtain a new mask with a sombrero, open up a music jukebox, provide a hidden Cluck gun or
      grant invincibility or one-shot kills.</story>

    <story>bit Generations: Boundish is a Game Boy Advance video game released in July of 2006. It was released as part
      of the bit Generations games, and was only released in Japan. The game can be easily compared to the game Pong,
      though it features many gameplay differences, graphical enhancements (despite the graphics themselves being
      deliberately primitive), and sounds.

      In the game, you'll take control of two paddles, each moving when the other one does. The goal is to keep the ball
      within the playing field. Allowing it to exit will result in a gameover. In all, there are five stages, each one
      containing different concepts though having the basic overall objective. For example, in the Wild Go Round you'll
      control a ball on a moving record. Because the record is moving, it'll alter the direction of the ball at pivotal
      moments, which will require the player to be quick on his feet and act appropriately. In all, the game's modes
      include Pool Flower, Box Juggling, Power Slide, Human League, and Wild Go Round. For players who wish to play
      multiplayer they can link with another Game Boy Advance with just a single cartridge. In multiplayer, all of the
      stages excluding Box Juggling are available for play.</story>

      Each step of the game the cursor will be one of the three colors that are in play. If there's a red, blue and
      purple tile, then clicking on a blue tile with a red cursor won't automatically turn it into that color but will
      rather turn it purple. By continually pressing that tile with a red cursor, however, will eventually change it
      into a red tile. As you progress through the game, and there will be more than just three different colors,

    <story>bit Generations: Dialhex is a Game Boy Advance video game released in 2006 by Nintendo and skip, Ltd. The
      game was part of the initial batch of bit Generations games. The game was not released in America or Europe, but a
      remake of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii's WiiWare service, was released two years later in 2008.
      The remake was slightly different, though was instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex.

      Gameplay
      In Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal of the game is to turn them in a
      way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you'll be rewarded a
      set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding
      areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down
      from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If
      the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then
      they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to
      come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game.

      Once you start a new game, you'll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons
      have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all,
      the colors, including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, cyan, and a darker green.

      After you've reached a certain point in the game's main mode, you'll be given access to the title's endless mode.
      In endless mode, you'll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as
      possible. The game starts similarly to the title's main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did
      in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover. In order to unlock
      the staff credits, you just need to create six cyan hexagons in the game's main mode. After doing this the credits
      will be available on the game's main screen.</story>

    <story>bit Generations: Orbital is a Game Boy Advance video game released exclusively in Japan as part of the second
      series of bit Generations titles. It is an innovative title that has the player consolidating a multitude of
      planets together in each stage to create on large rock. It was remade on WiiWare under the title of Art Style:
      ORBIENT, and was the first of at least three titles to be released in the Art Style series.

      Gameplay
      Before starting a stage the player will have to choose which galaxy he or she wishes to play within and then the
      stage. Following this your small star will shoot towards a large body with a varying amount of small stars
      orbiting it. The goal is to come in possession of those other stars in order to increase the size of the primary
      one. When ready, the player will shoot out of the orbit of a star and then be pulled into another one when he
      enters its range. If the player touches the star that the smaller ones are revolving around, then your star will
      blow up. With this said, it's suggested you constantly adjust the speed of your stara as not to rush into an
      orbit, ultimately causing it to crash.

      When one wishes to enter the orbit of a star, he'll have to press the A button, which is will "attract" your star
      towards it. If you don't want to enter it, then you'll have to press B, which will repel it. If the player wishes
      to change the position of the camera, then they can use the d-pad.

      When not in orbit around a star, you'll simply be floating. This is when you have to use a combination of the
      attract and repel buttons in order to change your direction. If you're going near a large star, then its orbit
      will effect the player more than a smaller one would, and you have more of a chance to start revolving around it.

      There are multiple obstacles in the game that are represented by the color red. Basically if it's red, you want to
      stay away from it. unfortunately using the repel or attract button will have no effect when you're next to an
      obstacle, though if a star is nearby and you're heading straight towards an obstacle, it's suggested that you get
      out of its way. Sometimes these hazards will even revolve around stars.</story>

      played entirely without looking at the screen, as the point is to listen to the sounds that are emitted from the
      Game Boy Advance's speaker. It should be noted, however, that it is quite a challenge to listen to the noises
      coming from the speaker, and that it's a lot easier to hook up ear phones or hook the GBA up to a stereo. It will
      also be very helpful to be in a quiet space.</story>

      angels, black-winged people who are called devils, and wingless people. Those who have wings have great powers and
      pay little mind to the wingless ones. The angels rule the world via a religious organization called the Prodevon

      the country. Grandpa Pete had all but three kills before he broke his leg; now, players must make the 65 kills to
      win the honor in Pete's name. The game includes several new items such as the PDA map. In addition to the main
      quest, players can also take on side missions from other hunters as they travel across Canada, Colorado, and New

      controlling Chicken Bill, shoots all the chickens that appear on the 2D hand-drawn screens, shown from a
      first-person perspective. There are 3 game modes:

      1. Arcade: shoot a specific number of chickens to move on to the next level. There is no time limit and the
      enemies attack by throwing eggs towards the screen. There is no time limit and when Chicken Bill's 100 points are
      depleted, the game is over.

      2. Classic: the same gameplay as Arcade, requiring a certain number of chickens to be shot, but now with a time
      limit added. Certain chickens carry time packages, providing time bonuses.

      3. Multiplayer: score more points than your opponent in a set amount of time.

      There are three difficulty levels and support for high scores (not saved after powering off). At the end of each
      level, statistics are shown based on the shots fired, hits, accuracy, general score, and energy or time remaining.
      There are different types of weapons (pistol, shotgun, uzi, machine gun, laster, flame thrower and bombs) and a
      limited amount of ammo. During gameplay, accuracy is shown through a thermometer on the screen. When it rises to
      the top, all hits are awarded with double points.</story>

    <story>Sketch Turner was a starving comic book artist, living with his pet rat Roadkill... that is until a lightning
      storm mysteriously brought his cartoon villain, Mortus, to life and imprisoned Sketch within the pages of his own
      comic book. Now trapped in the world that he himself created, but someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle
      through the pages of his own comic book, and past his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. Perhaps one of
      his own creations, General Alissa Cyan might be able to help...

      Comix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with a difference, you're inside of a comic book and you yourself
      know it. Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck
      havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that
      he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash
      powerful techniques.

      The game progresses linear through each page of the comic book, however secret paths and alternate routes through
      the story can be discovered. At the end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero rating for how well he's
      progressing.</story>

      character to play with, and you will need to take on familiar faces such as Li Mu Bai, Yu Shu Lien and Dark Cloud
      Lo.

      The 25 levels are based on locations in the film. Jen carries the sword Green Destiny and she can performs basic
      attacks on the ground, as well as in the air, or perform more impressive moves such as mid-air double-jumps or
      flying kicks. She can also climb by pushing off walls. By defeating enemies, a chi meter is filled, which allows
      to perform special moves. Chi can also be used to cure status ailments such as poison or daze.</story>

    <story>CT Special Forces is a side scrolling platform shooter that has a superficial similarity to the games of the
      Metal Slug series. The player controls an operative of a counter-terrorist force on a mission around the globe to
      stop terrorist activity and arrest its leaders. The digital pad moves the character, while the B button shoots the
      weapon and the A button makes the character jump. The character can't shoot downwards. The L trigger cycles
      through the inventory (displayed on the top-left corner of the screen) and the R trigger throws grenades (when
      they are available). By selecting an ammunition type, the character uses the corresponding weapon (gas canisters
      for the flamethrower, machine gun pents for that weapon, etc). The default rifle has an infinite number of
      bullets. Other items include a grappling rope and a pair of handcuffs to arrest surrended enemies. Ammunition and
      health packs are scattered throughout the levels, as are proximity mines and assorted enemies.

      The regular gameplay is occasionally broke by mini-games and entirely different sections: when the character
      collides with a reticule placard, the game switches to a first-person shooting gallery where the player has to
      shoot down a certain number of terrorists and rescue the hostages. When colliding with a parachute, two gauges
      with a red line on the middle appear on the screen. The one on the left measures the position of the falling
      character and the one on the right measures height. The character must be guided to the right spot, and the
      shooting button must be pressed when both gauges reach the red bar. Some mission stages change the game to a
      vertical shooter that recalls Tiger-Heli and similar games, where the player controls a helicopter viewed from the
      top.

      The game has 4 missions, each with its own theme: snow mountain, desert, jungle and a city. A password system is
      provided (the password is displayed after the completion of every mission).</story>

    <story>Game Boy Advance brings CT SPECIAL FORCES 3: BIOTERROR to fans of vertical action combat game play. A special
      military unit called the Special Intervention Forces has but a single mission- to do away with all terrorist
      organizations and other menacing threats. The latest threat has to do with the fact that the enemy has in their
      possession a biochemical weapon that alters human DNA. They have used this chemical to strengthen hostility and
      athletic genes to produce an original species of insurgent. The Counter Terrorist Special Intervention Forces are
      the only ones who possess the strength and skill to crush this new adversary. Each player is responsible for
      controlling his or her member of the CT Special Forces, as each mission becomes increasingly difficult. In the
      latest threat of terrorism, the need for underwater soldiers has become a necessity. With scuba diving skills, the
      player can explore several underwater regions. Combat takes place in both the water and on land, so the game
      presents the player with a number of vehicle and weaponry options. Each skill is the most sophisticated available
      and designed to seek out and destroy the enemy. The game takes the player through 20 levels that test, challenge
      and drive the Special Forces towards victory. Fans of combat action games with a patriotic tone must try this
      intense game.</story>

      in the Zoids series, and was sold as a special edition package bundled with a Diablo Tiger Beta toy. Both versions
      include an infrared adapter. This adapter, along with the game, made it possible to control the Cyber Drive Zoids
      wirelessly via the GBA. The GBA's R and L buttons are used for shifting, while the D-Pad moves the Zoid forwards
      and backwards. A fires the weapons, and B controls leaping. When controlling the Zoid, the GBA screen shots a
      special cockpit with information and read-outs. The RPG takes elements from both Zoids Saga and Zoids Assault game
      types, but features polygonal representations of Zoids as well as hand-drawn story segments.</story>

      is also an update of the original, but retains its side-scrolling gameplay.

      The cartridge includes several variants of the game. The main mode is called "XGP". Its basics are the same as in
      the original: The player's spaceship flies left or right over a scrolling landscape that wraps around after a few
      screens. The goal is destroy all invading aliens before they can capture the humans sitting on the ground. Besides
      updated graphics with various backgrounds and sprites for the enemies and humans, there are other differences as
      well: players can select from different ships, all with slightly different weapons and ratings for shields and
      speed. The XGP mode offers six different levels to complete. It can also be played by two players over the System

      The cartridge also includes "Classic" mode, which is a port of the original arcade game. Finally, "XG" mode is the

      and fight for control of England.

      After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers
      at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the
      three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

      The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your
      opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another
      territory/castle.

      The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D.
      Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</story>

    <story>The Digimon prove themselves to be versatile creatures as they hop in cars and compete against each other in
      this kart-style racing game.

      The third Digimon game for the Game Boy Advance, Digimon Racing has all the features you'd expect out of a racing
      game. There's a good variety of colorful and light-hearted tracks (15 in all, including a wide variety of themes
      such as jungles, deserts, busy city streets, ice tracks, and gravel-covered hills), nearly a dozen Digimon to pick
      from and unlock, and several gameplay modes ranging from cup races to time trials. A handful of boss races round
      out the action, and provide a challenge for players.

      The twist to this game comes as the racers collect energy on the track to digivolve into upgraded versions of
      themselves. Once you've digivolved, you can use additional offensive powers to further hamper your opponents and
      keep your own Digimon ahead of the others.

      While the single-player game will keep you busy for a while with its many modes and characters, Digimon Racing
      really shines in the multiplayer arena. Since it includes support for up to four players using the link cable or
      wireless adapter, the multiplayer experience is the real highlight of the game.</story>

    <story>A combo pack of the second Lizzie McGuire game as well as an episode from the TV series.

      In the interactive game, an animated Lizzie takes on a side-scrolling action-adventure filled with 12 captivating
      levels. Players travel to Lizzie's favorite places to hang, such as the beach and shopping mall -- but along the
      way must be sure to look out for cheerleaders and other rivals who are plotting to ruin the day.

      In the live action television episode, "You're a Good Man, Lizzie McGuire," featured on the game cartridge, the
      upcoming school dance has been cancelled due to someone defacing the school principal's statue, and won't be
      re-scheduled until the culprit confesses. Unfortunately for Lizzie, she saw the offender - and it's Kate. To make
      matters worse, Kate knows Lizzie knows, and now Lizzie is faced with the dilemma of either turning in Kate or
      sitting quietly and allowing the school dance to be cancelled. Meanwhile, Matt and Lanny pool their funds to buy a
      cool new bike, but then discover that sharing a bike is harder than it looks.</story>

      In order to do this, the gang must complete various party games while travelling along the game board. Players

      must be completed to move on, and the winner is the one with the most magical power stars, which are gained by

      There are four boards, each with their own theme based on an amusement park ride. Up to four players can play
      using the one console, or play with four consoles to challenge each other in a set of mini-games.</story>

    <story>King K. Rool has stolen Donkey Kong's banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In
      search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters
      (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are
      also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses,
      including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of
      villainy.

      Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is
      generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to
      throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do
      cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.

      The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas,
      where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a
      larger version of a minor enemy.</story>

    <story>In this sequel to the original Doom, you play the same hero - the last remaining space marine. After having
      single-handedly saved Mars from demonic threat, you return to Earth, only to find out that the demons have already
      invaded it, killed all its inhabitants or turned them into demons. It's your task to kill all the demons and to
      save the Earth.

      Doom II looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, utilizing the same 3D graphical engine with 2D sprites
      for enemies. The gameplay once again consists entirely of navigating the hero from first-person view through 3D
      environments and shooting at the demons while attempting to find your way out by flipping switches and looking for
      keys. Unlike in Doom, which is divided into three episodes, the 30 levels of Doom II (plus the 2 secret levels)
      form one long episode.

      You have the same weapons as in the first Doom, plus a new one: a super shotgun. There are also some new demons in
      this sequel, such as the chaingun-toting Heavy Weapon Dudes, the skeletal Revenants who launch homing missiles and
      the Arch-Viles who have a highly damaging fire attack. There is also one new power-up, a Megasphere which boosts
      your health and armor to the max.</story>

    <story>Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance adaptation of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. Based on the
      "Three Kingdoms period" of ancient China, it takes place at the end of the Han Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the
      previous government collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one another, eventually establishing three
      powerful kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of these nations spend the next 100 years fighting among
      one another, each trying to become the dominant power.

      Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based strategy board game, but with a focus on action combat. Since it
      is based on the earlier Dynasty Warriors titles, many of the same concepts carry over. Players begin by choosing
      one of three available characters from the lands of either Wu, Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique
      storyline and missions. A briefing is given for each mission detailing specific objectives before allowing the
      player to equip themselves with weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the player moves the designed number
      of spaces (determined by movement) around the "board". If an enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a
      top-down action fighting mode. Here the player uses one button to attack, another button to charge and another to
      unleash a misou special attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is charged by successful attacking enemy units.
      The player's success against the enemy unit will determine the unit's "heath" and will be destroyed completely if
      all of it's units are destroyed. Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but enemy generals who have their own
      special moves and greater health. Many missions feature specific objectives rather than just defeating all
      enemies.</story>

    <story>Ecks vs. Sever is the amongst the first FPSes to be featured on the Game Boy Advance. The game tells the

      cat-and-mouse-hunt progresses, both agents will find out that they are mere pawns in a larger government
      conspiracy...

      In the Single Player mode, the player can choose wether he wants to play as Ecks or Sever. The choice makes a
      radical difference in the single-player campaign. As Ecks, your orders are to chase Sever, whilst as Sever, you
      have to evade him. The levels for both characters tend to be the same, but with different objectives, and
      different locations for both characters.

      As an example, the orders of Sever are to hunt down and kill a government agent whilst as Ecks, your orders are to
      prevent the assassination. During this level, both characters will encounter each other. As Ecks, you'll have to
      try and snipe Sever whilst evading her grenades. When you play this level as Sever, you'll have to throw grenades
      at Ecks, whilst avoiding his sniper fire.

      The game also has a multi-player mode for up to 4 players with three different modes, which are Deathmatch (Every
      man for himself), Assassination (one player is the assassin who has to hunt down the VIP who's being protected by
      bodyguards) and Bomb kit (Try to gather all parts of a bomb before the other players do).</story>

      game, switching between them at any point. Each of the three had their own special abilities, and players will
      need to master each character to get through the puzzle-filled levels. Ed is the powerhouse of the team, able to
      pick up large objects and move them out of the way. Edd can operate machinery and can make use of different items.
      Eddy has stealth abilities and is the only character who can use stink bombs to get enemies out of the way. Each
      of the three also has an unique team-up move that involved all three characters working together. The levels
      contain the typical insanity often found in the cartoon. On one level, for example, players have to try to sell a
      number of snow cones from their snow cone stand; however, to get the business going, players have to steal ice
      from other characters. There are several different scams to complete, each of which involves Ed, Edd, and Eddy

    <story>As an Eggo builder, its your job to sort and organise air-dropped puzzle pieces to assemble platforms that
      gradually form a tower above a steadily rising ocean. Because water quickly seeps up through incomplete floors it
      is vital that you build complete platforms to slow the rising water. The goal is to reach the balloon that hovers
      high in the sky, however, to complicate matters, tower-tumbling and thieving enemies prowl the depths and soar the
      skies, looking for ways to drown your spirit - so work quickly!!</story>

    <story>A re-release of the original Elevator Action (the "old") with an additional arranged version created
      specifically for the GBA (the "new").

      Elevator Action casts you as a super-spy with the mission to collect secret documents from an enemy building and
      escape unharmed. Played from a non-scrolling side view, you have to direct your agent to each office in order to
      collect the documents while avoiding enemy guards and their weapons. You can navigate from floor to floor by
      controlling the many elevators that fill the building, as well as shoot your enemies or light fixtures in each
      floor to give you an edge while your enemies stumble in the dark.

      The new arranged version features remade cute-fied graphics, multiple selectable characters (each with different
      abilities and attacks), a health bar, and expanded levels with more challenges and new enemies such as robots and
      zombies. But otherwise plays just like the original.</story>

    <story>Eragon for the Game Boy Advance is a traditional turn based RPG with a combat system that emphasizes motion
      and action. Players use combinations of spells, melee attacks, and ranged attacks to battle Urgals, thieves,
      soldiers, and other various enemies. This is an RPG where combat strategy plays a key role in success.

      Players can make use of the RPG mechanics to create offensive and defensive potions, craft better armor and
      weapons, learn offensive and defensive spells, or become trackers who are able to find hidden encounters. This
      design encourages experimentation, opens up a lot of strategic possibilities, and allows a lot of replayability.

      The player assumes the role of Eragon, a young boy with a mysterious origin and an important future, on his
      perilous journey to avenge his father, rescue the woman of his dreams and join forces with the Varden in their war
      against King Galbatorix. On this adventure Eragon encounters many allies; Brom the old wizened story teller, Ayra
      the elf guard of the dragon egg, Murtagh the orphan with a troubled past, Angela an herbalist witch, and a
      powerful dragon that will help unveil Eragon's true destiny.</story>

    <story>One of the Game Boy Advance's launch titles from Majesco (alongside Boxing Fever and Iridion 3D), F-14 Tomcat
      is essentially a port of Absolute Entertainment's 1994 SNES game Turn and Burn: No-Fly Zone. The game content is
      exactly the same, but it features a multiplayer mode between other systems (if they have a copy of the game and
      the GBA Link Cable, of course) and a brand new storyline: the player controls a F-14 pilot chosen by the US
      government to be assigned in the theater of operations of a war between the republics of China and Taiwan to
      protect America's "interests" in the region.

      The game includes, apart from the previously mentioned multiplayer mode, a landing practice mode, like Turn and
      Burn. It was later implemented in Majesco's two following GBA flight sims, 2004's Super Hornet F/A-18F and 2007's
      F24 Stealth Fighter, which re-used this game's engine, with the option of selecting between a landing carrier or a

    <story>The player will control Timmy, who enters the world of his favorite comic book hero, the Crimson Chin. When
      Timmy discovers Chin has been kidnapped, the only person to save the day is Chin's sidekick, Cleft the Boy Chin
      Wonder, who just happens to be Timmy in costume. The player must release Chin from captivity by defeating enemies
      and overcoming obstacles along the way in this side-scrolling, action-packed videogame. Timmy's quirky Fairy
      Godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, appear throughout the 20 game stages to offer their own strange attempts at
      assistance. Cosmo and Wanda will supply Timmy/Cleft items to use in his journey -- some of which are key in
      defeating the captors. Throughout Fairly OddParents, gamers will move through several environments, including the
      Comic World, the Primitive Age, the Present World and the Future World.</story>

      through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the

    <story>The Princess has been kidnapped by King Koopa (again) and it's up to Mario and Luigi to save her (again). Not
      to be confused with the western Super Mario Bros. 2, this sequel to Super Mario Bros. is very much an expansion to
      the original, with many reused graphics and concepts, though new ones are also present.

      Instead of offering a two-player mode as in the original, this game allows you to choose between a Mario mode and
      a Luigi mode, with each character handling differently. Mario has tighter ground control, while Luigi has greater
      jumping capabilities.

      Power-ups remain the same: Super Mushrooms grow a brother from small to Super size, Fire Flowers give them the
      ability to throw fireballs at enemies, Starman makes a character temporarily invincible, and a 1-Up Mushroom will
      give one more life. New to this game is a power-down, a Poison Mushroom which will harm you as if it were an
      enemy.

      The goal is still to survive from the left side of the level to the right, avoiding perils and bopping enemies
      along the way, progressing through a series of 8 worlds with 4 levels each. That is, unless a warp zone is found
      allowing areas to be skipped. There are new tricks that work for and against the player, though. Some piranha
      plants will come out of their pipe even if you're standing right next to them, and bloobers now appear outside of
      the water. Wind can be present to alter how jumps will behave. Some warp zones will actually take the player to an
      earlier level instead of to a later one.</story>

    <story>This game is a licensee of the 2005 movie "Fantastic 4". Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person
      action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual
      movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the
      comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only
      concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka "Doctor Doom" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various
      characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay
      usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that
      cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies
      and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields
      points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice
      it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal
      single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.</story>

    <story>EA Sports takes players back to the field with FIFA SOCCER 06 for the Game Boy Advance. Featuring nearly ever
      soccer team in existence and hundred of players, plus tweaks in game play and several new additions. Gamers will
      first notice the slight changes in controlling their teams. The passing and dribbling controls have been
      fine-tuned, allowing gamers to control nearly every aspect of the game. Each player has a strength rating that
      comes into effect when passing, as does the amount of weight players put behind the kick. A new shooting method,
      called the Optimized Shot Meter, requires more control and attention, as well. All of these realistic details make
      gamers feel like they're actually in the game and in control of everything. Manager mode now requires players to
      keep their club's budgets and handle purchases. Players have to decide how much to spend on staff, recruiting,
      stadium expenses, and other items. Then gamers have to decide if they want to sign with a sponsor to bring in
      extra income. All of this adds up to create a game that requires managers to really manage their team. FIFA SOCCER
      06 contains all of the modes that made the previous FIFA SOCCER games great, including season, tournament,
      shoot-out, and verses modes. Soccer fans will enjoy playing against all of today's best soccer clubs throughout
      the season as they recruit, train, and guide their team to victory in FIFA SOCCER 06.</story>

      FIFA 2003 is the tenth game in the FIFA series and the seventh to be produced in 3D. A number of new features were
      added to improve upon the previous version. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing
      against 17 of Europe's top clubs in their own stadiums and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A
      TV-style broadcast package gives highlights at half-time and full-time, as well as comprehensive analysis. One of
      the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's "Freestyle Control" which allows the user to flick the ball on
      and lay it off to team mates. Other additions include greater likenesses of some of the more well-known players
      such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses.

      The European cover features Roberto Carlos, Ryan Giggs, and Edgar Davids, representing Brazil, Manchester United
      and Juventus respectively. In the United States, Landon Donovan appeared in Roberto Carlos' place.</story>

    <story>Released only a few months after Euro 2004, FIFA 2005 brings several features to the franchise, such as the
      return of a player creation tool, where a player can be created from scratch from customizing the face (while it's
      not possible to define the texture like in previous EA Sports games such as NHL 2000, the player can customize the
      facial features such as shape of the eyes or the cheeks, in a way similar to RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights),
      accessories and playing abilities. It's also possible to create all kinds of competitions. The Career mode was
      also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated
      match anytime. This mode is a "light" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players
      and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff).</story>

      1. Standard: race for the first place.

      2. Elimination: race five opponents over three laps. After the first and the second lap, the last two cars are
      knocked out and a duel ensues in the final lap.

      3. Duel: a 3-lap race against six challengers in succession. After each won lap, a new one starts.

      4. Drafting: stay in the opponent's slipstream to raise a power bar.

      5. Driving Skills: race against the time and keep the timer going by passing through gates that award time
      bonuses.

      6. Seconds Out: race against the time while collecting bonuses.

      7. Time Attack: a straightforward timed race.

      8. Boost: race with two boosts per lap.

      9. Relay: transfer a baton three times around the track.

      10. Overtake: overtake a number of vehicles before time runs out.</story>

    <story>Fortress is a Tetris-variant puzzle game. As in that classic game, geometric pieces fall from the top of the
      screen and must be arranged in lines. Only instead of eliminating lines, the objective this time is to add them to
      the screen. The game starts with a timer (that counts a moment where neither player attack) and a castle gate
      falling between two flags (the opponent's flags can be seen to the left of the screen). Once placed, the remaining
      pieces are used to build a castle around it, as every 2x3 grid of pieces transforms into its walls. A grid of 8x3
      pieces transforms into a wizard's tower that can summon a creature to attack the enemy castle.

      Certain special blocks add features to the building: a cannon block places a shooting cannon that starts to attack
      automatically the opponent's fortress. A block with a window adds one to the building. Repairing peons come out of
      it to help fix the damage to the castle's walls. A block with a bomb adds a cannon that fires a peon towards the
      opponent's castle (an aiming reticule is shown over the enemy castle to help choose the right spot). Building
      walls around these special blocks prevent their destruction from the enemy attack. A monster appears randomly at
      the bottom of the screen to attack both players.

      The player's goal at each level is to reach a number of score points before the opponent. The pieces can be
      maneuvered with the digital pad, and pressing UP on it makes them fall fast downwards. They can be rotated
      clockwise and anti-clockwise with the A and B buttons, respectively. Holding the R trigger allows the player to
      move the screen with the digital pad (for a full view of battle scene). When pressed, the L trigger destroys the
      top 3 rows of your castle and decreases the score.

      The game has three game modes: tournament, battle and blitz. They vary in the amount of seconds on the timer and
      the goal score. There are four themes: pre-historic, medieval, pirate and space.</story>

      multiple paths unlocked by using the increasing abilities of Frogger. The game features almost 20 different levels
      and RPG-inspired gameplay on top of the classic Frogger formula.</story>

    <story>The game takes place in Dino City, a virtual city where monsters known as Dinos can live. As the player, you
      are given the responsibility of creating Dinos and building places for them to live in the city. You can also use
      your Dinos to battle against other humans' Dinos through a system known as Dino Net. Battles take place on a
      virtual grid where both teams cannot see the other until they choose to attack. The battle system is quite
      different from other RPGs in this sense, with strategic elements resembling Battleship and Minesweeper. For
      battling, Dinos are capable of equipping specialized weapons and armor known as Devices. Devices boost a Dino's
      stats in battle and also give them a special attack, effectively allowing the player to customize the Dino's
      strengths and moveset.</story>

    <story>GensÅ Suikoden Card Stories (Japanese: å¹»æƒ³æ°´æ»¸ä¼ ã‚«ãƒ¼ãƒ‰ã‚¹ãƒˆãƒ¼ãƒªãƒ¼ã‚º?) is a spin-off title of
      the Suikoden franchise by Konami which includes both a Game Boy Advance game and a physical collectible card game.
      Both were released in the fall of 2001 in Japan, neither have been translated into other languages.

      Unlike other areas of the Suikoden franchise, in which the storyline is a major element of gameplay, Card Stories
      focuses mainly on the card battles themselves and less on the plot.

      Most of the cards feature characters who appear in both Suikoden and Suikoden II of Konami's role-playing video
      game series. Several cards also feature characters who would later go on to appear in Suikoden III.

      The GBA game retells the story of Suikoden II with a few changes to how they transpire.</story>

    <story>Paintball professional Greg Hasting's returns in Activision's GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for
      the Game Boy Advance, the sequel to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL. The second game in the series includes a
      number of paintball pros, different modes, and a level editor. Like the previous game, GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT
      PAINTBALL MAX'D includes a number of different gameplay modes. Players work as part of a team (either
      AI-controlled or with friends) to take down the opposing team in a number of different environments. The
      single-player campaign mode takes it a step further, putting players in charge of forming a paintball team from a
      number of unknowns and turning them into paintball champions. Along the way, players will face off against
      big-name paintball players, including Nicky Cuba, Matt Marshall, Peter Utsching, and, eventually, Greg Hasting
      himself. Between tournaments, players can purchase new equipment for their characters and spend accumulated skill
      points to increase their statistics. The biggest addition to MAX'D is the level editor. This allows gamers to
      create their own paintball arenas ranging from small to large, cluttered to open. Players can add bunkers, rocks,
      trees, picnic tables, and many other items to the field. Each map can be shared online or played with
      computer-controlled opponents. The ability to create and share custom levels online will keep players coming back
      to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for some time. It provides gamers with everything that makes
      paintball great without worrying about getting a ball of paint all over their faces.</story>

    <story>The game for Game Boy Advance based on the second Harry Potter book and movie is, like its predecessor, an
      action adventure, this time with an isometric perspective.

      In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, bad things are happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and
      what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive (and advance the plot) Harry must again
      complete various challenges. These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles,
      flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in
      places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he
      can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house
      points can be deducted.

      As in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of
      Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in
      the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina.

      Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back.</story>

      Lord Voldemort. The Minister for Magic has decided to teach courses in defensive magic, but this leaves the young
      wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them. Meeting secretly with a

    <story>The first Harry Potter game for the Game Boy Advance is an action adventure that lets you play as Harry in
      his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, following the story of the book and the movie.

      You control Harry from an overhead view and must complete several tasks. These range from mundane class
      assignments like collecting ingredients for a potion to facing off against a giant troll. To master these
      challenges, Harry can learn five spells that allow him to push back opponents, flip switches, open doors, levitate
      objects and more. If Harry is hurt, he can find and eat Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans to regain health. By
      performing admirably in learning spells and completing missions, Harry can gain extra House Points so that
      Gryffindor might win the House Cup. If he misbehaves by attacking other students, or being caught wandering the
      halls at night, points will be deducted, however.
      As seeker for the Gryffindor team, Harry must also compete in Quidditch matches. The game has a special mode for
      Quidditch and other events where Harry might have to mount his broom.</story>

      Abdul (in a truck) and Agent Bruce.

    <story>Island Xtreme Stunts is a mixture of different genres in a single game. The player explores a LEGO-based
      environment in an open world format: ride a skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst
      performing stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead
      stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island.

      Even though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions.
      All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and
      do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the
      younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player
      can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses.</story>

      later, the "Settlers" arrived and built their cities in the lands where the machinery was left, and all was

      However, nothing remains perfect forever. Powerful alchemists tried to harness the power of the Ancients' machines
      in their lust for power, and war broke out. Those that tried to use the Ancients' machines, or The Dark
      Alchemists, as they became known, were killed or exiled, and peace eventually returned. Rumour has it though, that
      the last of the Dark Alchemists, the Monophonic Menace, has returned to conquer the world.

      Juka and the Monophonic Menace is an action-adventure game. The title character, Juka, is an alchemist who can

    <story>K-1 Pocket Grand Prix 2 is a Kickboxing game, published by Konami, it was released only in Japan in 2002.

      K-1 Pocket Grand Prix 2 is a Japan only sequel in which you can select from a roster of 17 famous K-1 fighters
      from different regions and compete to win the grand prix tournament.
      You can also create a fighter and select a region and selection of punches and kicks for him.
      The game represents the fighters as over top cartoony sprites in the same style as puzzle fighter does for street
      fighter characters.
      The game plays out in sped up 3 minute rounds and does not represent accurate K-1 fighting as fighters can utilize
      special moves such as flaming kicks.
      The game borrows features from other 2D fighters such as street fighter allowing you to do charge attacks,
      parries, super moves and you win the game by depleting your opponents health bar.
      The game is a little tongue in cheek, when cro-cop wins a fight he does his winning pose in his famous cop

      later levels, you will have snowboarding, flying and jet skiing. As you travel along, enemies try to stop you. You
      must kill or avoid these enemies. Your main weapon is a pair of boxing gloves with which you can pound enemies
      but, if you push down and attack, you can also do a tail spin to attack lower-height enemies. In each level, there
      are flags you can pick up and, by pressing select, you can drop them to create your own continue point.</story>

    <story>Karnaaj Rally is a handheld racing game which is played from a top down perspective and mixes 2D and 3D
      graphics. It's an arcade racer similar to Micro Machines where the player competes against three other racers on a
      number of different tracks. To his help, the player has a temporary turbo which he can refill by driving over
      special items that he finds on the race tracks. Weapons exist too; rockets and mines can be used by the player to
      stop the competition from winning.

      The game's career mode allows the player to compete and progress in four different race series. Each of these has
      unique vehicles and courses. While racing the player can earn money which can be used to upgrade the car's tires
      and engine as well as buy more armor, rockets and mines. There's also a gambling option. The player can bet by
      guessing on different outcomes from the races, such as the right finishing order.

      The game also has a multiplayer mode for up to four players.</story>

    <story>Do you like to surf? Have you ever imagined surfing at different remote locations around the world? Well,
      Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme
      similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it's easy to jump into the game and surf.

      PS2, XB, and GC description, further below is the GBA description.

      Game Play Modes:
      Infinite Time - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy
      the surf.

      High Score - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get?

      Icon Challenge - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out.

      Career Mode - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you
      progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes
      of play.

      Multiplayer Modes:
      Push - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to "push" the split screen towards their opponent's half of
      the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from
      the screen.

      Head to Head - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points
      when the time runs out.

      Time Attack - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is
      alloted to your opponent.

      The Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon
      Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters.

      The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's
      Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.

      The PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4

      GBA description

      Surf Modes:
      Championship - Compete against 8 other surfers. You progress by surfing in 12 stages, 3 heats per stage. Your surf
      score is tallied from each heat and the top 3 surfers of the stage get to move on.

      Challenge - Pick a surfer and do challenges around the world.

      Drop In - Instant action surfing - go and just surf.

      Multiplayer - With a Link Cable and another copy of the game you and a friend can link up to compete against each
      other.

      The Pros are the same as above.

      The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Waimea Bay, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's
      Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.</story>

    <story>Aiming and moving in cover and blind-fire modes is tricky, though. To gain the 3-D effect, some detail gets
      sacrificed. Usually this is no problem, but occasionally you'll have a tough time recognizing an object. You move
      from area to area to engage a new group of enemies. You'll conveniently find crates for cover and barrels to help
      you pull off big explosions. Locking the enemy in your crosshairs, signified by your crosshairs turning red,
      doesn't guarantee a direct hit? The accuracy depends on the weapon of choice. A shotgun will normally provide a
      kill on the first shot. If you have an automatic rifle, your shots are relatively inaccurate even if your aim is
      true.</story>

    <story>Klonoa Heroes: Densetsu no Star Medal is an action role-playing game developed and published by Namco and
      released in Japan in 2002. It is the first game in the Klonoa series to combine both standard action-gaming
      elements with role-playing features.
      Taking a unique twist on the normal gameplay of the Klonoa handheld games, Klonoa Heroes instead relies on the
      player moving Klonoa, Guntz, or Pango across the screen from a top-down perspective, having them defeat enemies
      and earn experience points in the form of Dream Shards (small, crystal-like objects) and gold, which is used for
      currency, along the way. Klonoa once again utilizes his familiar weapon, the Wind Ring, but this time the "wind
      bullet" he can fire from it can be either blue or red. Guntz's handguns and Pango's bombs work the same way.
      Characters can acquire different weapons throughout the game. Likewise, each enemy in the game is given a color
      affinity of either blue or red, and Klonoa (or the other characters) can deal more damage to them by attacking
      with the same color.</story>

    <story>Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World is an action/adventure video game developed by Ubisoft for the Nintendo
      Game Boy Advance. In Europe, it is known as King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie. Due to the limited
      technology the Game Boy Advance has, King Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World is very different from the home
      console versions of the game. In this game, players switch between various roles - one being the movie exhibition
      visiting Skull Island to do filming which comprises actress Ann Darrow, director Carl Denham and scriptwriter Jack
      Driscoll, and the 25 ft gorilla and king of Skull Island, King Kong. While the overhead human section focuses on
      puzzle-solving and adventuring elements, Kong sections are combat-oriented side-scrollers.</story>

    <story>Kururin Paradise is the sequel to the GBA launch title, Kuru Kuru Kururin. In this game, Kururin and his
      family see an advertisement for the circus, which takes place at 6:00. Kururin's family arrive there on time, but
      Kururin is late, and when he gets there, everybody is missing! It's up to Kururin to search across the land for
      his missing family using his faithful helicopter, the Heririn. As in the first game, Kururin must navigate his way
      through fairly narrow mazes, trying not to hit the walls. Three consecutive hits, and the Heririn is destroyed,
      and you must start the stage again.

      Paradise is vastly improved from the original game. It is now possible to find hidden keys in the levels, which
      open up locked doors, allowing for branched paths in the world map. Certain paths also lead to boss encounters,
      which take the form of an addictive mini-game including, but not limited to, lawn mowing, gathering stars, flying
      Kururin himself through clouds, and hopping across a path dodging helicopter blades. If you beat the boss, these
      mini-games are then added to your mini-game library, where you can play them against up to three friends using
      only one cart.

      The game also features twelve toys built in that can be accessed by selecting one from a menu, then turning your
      GBA off, then on again. Most of them are fairly useless or incomprehensible in Japanese, but there are a couple of
      interesting ones, like the love tester, the musical note player, and the memory match game.</story>

    <story>Based on the movie (and first three books of the series), Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events for
      Game Boy Advance puts players in the unfortunate shoes of the incredibly unlucky Baudelaire orphans: Violet,
      Klaus, and Sunny.

      Each orphan has an unusual talent that will let them progress through three chapters (each with over a dozen
      levels). Though the game looks like a traditional side-scroller, combat takes a backseat to clever puzzle-solving
      and adventure game elements. The three orphans must use their talents, along with items found in the world, and
      various interactions to escape each level and avoid the evil Count Olaf and his elaborate plans to inherit the
      children's fortune.

      Inventions also take a big role in this game, and players will have to assemble them from common household
      objects. For example, in one level, Violet will be hunting for ice cream scoopers, soup cans, and a crank to
      invent an "apple chucker" which can help defeat Count Olaf's friends.

      The game offers quite a bit of replayability, too, with quest points and exotic books earned for discovering all
      the game's quirky secrets.</story>

    <story>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the
      evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have
      to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big
      lizards and more.

      The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump,
      run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own
      skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield
      which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things
      with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a
      team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

      The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space
      in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses
      them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.

      put the finishing details on their escape plan, which involved digging a tunnel under the zoo and all the way to
      Antarctica. Of course, this isn't as easy as it sounds, and the penguins will need a number of supplies, items,

      Madagascar. Gamers take control of Private Penguin, who is assigned a number of missions to accomplish. He begins
      with a few standard attack and jumping moves, but as the game progresses, he will learn more powerful attacks and
      abilities like sliding. He will also find several useful gadgets to defeat enemies with. The four main characters

    <story>Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, this game follows the story of the emperor penguins as they
      embark on a long journey to breed their young. The game has been divided into twelve chapters, with different
      gameplay. The penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate, find food, take care of
      the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all the way back.

      A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players need to help them
      land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides,
      bridges and steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars and the penguins need
      to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they
      simply restart at the beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a group to
      succeed.

      Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place underwater
      where predators need to be avoided while collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds
      an new layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There is little time to pick it
      up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a warm spot before the thermometer time runs out.

      Some educational content has also been included. Next to the habits, more information about the penguin migration
      in provided in between levels.</story>

    <story>The first portable incarnation of the Mario Party series, Mario Party Advance shakes things up quite a bit on
      the GBA. With the focus on the single-player, there are all kinds of single-player mini-games, one giant
      single-player board to traverse instead of multiple ones (Shroom City), and all kinds of different Gaddgets and
      gameplay modes to indulge in.

      The main single-player experience involves traveling across "Shroom City," which is a major departure from the
      standard set-up in past Mario Party titles. You have the choice to be Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi, and depending
      on who you choose, you'll start at a different spot on the board, which is quite large.

      You're given die rolls to navigate the board and, when you reach special sections of the map, complete special
      quests, which often involve helping residents of Shroom City and/or participating in special challenges. Most
      quests involve collecting some sort of object elsewhere or a mini-game. By completing these quests, you'll collect
      stars, which eventually allow for special boss bouts with Bowser, and you'll unlock mini-games and Gaddgets, which
      are simple, toy-like contraptions that you can play with.

      The game ends when you complete your allotted number of turns, although additional turns and die rolls can be
      earned during the game by completing the "Mushroom Challenges" that occur rather often. After completing your
      session, your rewards are saved, and you can play with your mini-games and Gaddgets in Play Mode.

      There are also two additional modes available, "Party Land," where you can play special duel mini-games with a
      friend, and "Challenge Land," where you play through special modes that test your mini-game skills to earn coins,
      which can be used to purchase additional unlockables in a shop.

      Finally, there is also a feature called the "Bonus Board." You can play with a board that is included with the
      game using the GBA. The GBA takes care of die rolls, mini-games, and end-of-the-game events.</story>

      directly at Bowser's Castle. Mario is also transformed into a ball and chases after her.

      There are 5 levels, each consisting of a set of pinball tables. Each table has some exits (including the one below
      the flippers) that Mario can use to move to other tables. Also, each one holds a star, normally obtained by
      defeating all enemies on the table. Some exits require that Mario has a certain number of stars. To gain access to
      Bowser's castle, Mario must defeat the bosses of the first 4 levels, which gives him star keys. The game also
      features a "Time Attack" mode, which allows players to fight already defeated bosses again.</story>

      Mazes of Fate is a fantasy medieval first person "dungeon-crawler" RPG in which you create a character based on
      gender, class and attributes (or take your pick from one of the three pre-made characters) and set out in a quest

      control your party from an overhead perspective and visit shops and get quests from NPCs and the many dungeons
      that compose the bulk of the game itself. While dungeon crawling the game switches to a first-person perspective
      from which you control your party as it fights all the monsters that cross your path and loot the treasures
      uncovered. Combat is real-time although the game pauses while you navigate action menus.

      Features loads of items, weapons and quests, as well as tons of monsters and up to 5 recruit-able party members.

    <story>Medarot Navi is the first game in the Medarot series released for the Game Boy Advance system. It was
      released in two versions: Kabuto Version (represented by Granbeetle) and Kuwagata Version (represented by Sonic
      Stag).
      This game features a different protagonist from previous entries in the series: Kasumi Asano, a bespectacled boy
      who discovers an alien Medarot, Mistral, underneath the auditorium of an abandoned school. A field trip to the
      Cluster space station goes awry with the "exile" of the class to the various modules and the reveal of the Space
      Robos!
      Unlike the other entries in the series with their charge/cooldown "relay race" cycles, Medarot Navi features a
      tiled 9x9 map that more closely resembles Fire Emblem and an initiative system similar to Final Fantasy Tactics.
      Movement and Part Actions are carried out using "Action Points" that are distributed at the beginning of the turn
      and expended when a Medarot acts.</story>

      Battle Chip GP! Take control of your favorite character and face off against many opponents as you make your way
      to the head of the GP to reach the ultimate prize, an incredibly rare battle chip!

      Gameplay is based around the Mega Man Battle Network series of games, in that players purchase and use various
      battle chips to combat their opponents. However, unlike the main games, players do not have direct control over
      their Net Navi. Instead, players pre-select their battle chips, and one of these chips are used in the battle
      against the opponent. Once selected, the game automatically plays out the battle.

      There is also a process called 'slotting in', which can be performed by pressing L or R during battle when your
      slot in gauge is full. Slotting in allows you to use an additional battle chip during gameplay to assist you. If
      successful, the chip will be used, and aid you with healing, dealing extra damage, and so on.</story>

      ruin...a hero from the past, reborn in the future.

      In addition to the old Cyber Elf system, this game also contains a new "chip" system, where Zero can gain new

      this game by giving them nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of the Cyber Elves, they added the new
      concept of "Cyber Space" to levels, where you enter a door to Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf as
      much as you please without them dying. However, there aren't too many "Secret Disks" (items that can contain

    <story>Being a real-estate magnate used to be hard work. Thanks to technology, the computer does all the hard stuff,
      like rolling dice, for you. Freed of the anxiety of arguing over leaners, you have plenty of time to strategize
      your next financial move. Up to four players, or you and three computer opponents, take turns around the board. A
      player wins when the others go belly up. You can also play a quick game mode or a time limit game. In any of the
      game modes, you can institute your own house rules. Some of those could include awarding a person for landing on
      free parking, dealing out some properties at random to begin the game, or changing the number of properties you
      have to own in a group before you can build houses. The easy-to-use interface makes it easy to manage your

      Monster Gate game on the Gameboy Advance. The game features a selection of procedurally generated dungeons, each
      of which has its own size, depth, selection of monsters and various special rules/features. You start out with
      base stats and quickly gain experience levels for killing monsters (which are invisible, and which you can judge
      only by looking at your max HP). It doesn't take many kills before you stop gaining exp levels. To help yourself
      in the dungeon, you can bring up to 10 single-use cards (more can be found in the dungeon), which act as spells.

      Monster House is an action-adventure game developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by THQ. The game
      is based on the film of the same name.

      Although the game was marketed toward the same pre-teen audience as the accompanying film, its gameplay was highly
      reminiscent of Resident Evil 4; the game was generally higher-quality than many other games based on children's
      films, and it received high ratings from numerous prominent gaming magazines and websites, including Play magazine
      and GameZone.

      Monster House was met with mixed reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Game
      Boy Advance version 66.50% and 69/100, the GameCube version 65.13% and 60/100, the DS version 63.65% and 62/100

    <story>Monster Rancher Advance is a monster raising sim that allows players to raise and customize 440 monster
      types. These monsters can then be tested in in-game tournaments, or battled against other players in 2P mode with
      the GBA link cable.

      Monsters are created in the game's shrine through the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. Players
      begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8
      characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make
      different types of monsters, but each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one
      unique.

      Players then train the monsters by choosing which foods to feed, which drills to do to raise attributes, what
      training to send them to for new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of
      money with which food and items can be purchased, more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around
      planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling a bank account, along with attempting to win
      tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better
      attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game,
      however, they do face an enforced retirement age.

      There is a fairly straightforward storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games visit, and new
      characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended and has
      unlimited replay value.

      The 2 Player mode, involving a link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they
      have raised against other players. The 2P mode also allows players to trade items and cash with one another, to
      wager items or cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters into each others' games.</story>

      unlocked for as long as you like. In Challenge, you are competing in a tournament and will have a time limit and a
      specific location to fish at.

      When you start at a location in either mode, you have the option to move your boat to any place on the map.
      However, this does take time and may not always be in your best interest in the Challenge mode. You can then
      either start casting, or you can change your lure first.

      Catching fish is really just a matter of using a good lure and tempting movements. When a fish strikes, you need
      to keep enough pressure on the line to keep the hook set, or the fish will get away. If you let the line get too
      tight, the line will break and you'll lose the fish then as well. Now just reel it in and see what you caught.

      The GUI shows a nice fish finder that is color-coded by the type of fish that is seen. Note that this finder is
      not always accurate.

      Statistics for the game are very nice. You can see a nice picture of your fish that you catch along with the size
      of it. The top 6 can then be saved in the Aquarium for viewing at any time. Your tournament scores will be based
      on weight of fish and any monster bonuses (bonuses for catching one of the top 3 largest fish that round). Winning
      the tournaments will unlock new locations and let you progress to a new location for the next tournament. It will
      also get you a nice trophy.</story>

    <story>This really couldn't be any simpler; Moorhen features no complicated gameplay whatsoever. You just shoot
      things. The real skill though is in knowing just what to shoot and when to shoot it and where some targets reap
      sizeable rewards others will drain your score in no time at all. One addition to version three is the introduction
      of protected birds flying around with your intended targets which means that shooting now takes a little more
      thought than simply blasting into the sky. Other features remain intact and there are still items that need to be
      avoided such as balloons and various animals on the ground. As usual though you'll need to experiment to find out
      just what's worth hitting and what's not.

      One of the best parts of the Moorhen series has been the hidden bonuses and secrets but they've always been well
      concealed and you're more likely to discover them by accident rather than actually work them out. I won't spoil
      some of the goodies we've discovered in this version but Moorhuhn 2 featured spiders that could be spun around
      trees and the first edition had you shaking trees then shooting down ten leaves for a 100 point bonus. Finally the
      hi-score chart is still there as is the wonderful battery back up so you can prove that you did actually get a
      score over 50.</story>

    <story>The Nowhere Islands are an idyllic place; the residents of Tazmily Village live peacefully and in harmony
      with nature and with each other. But this changes when the mysterious Pigmask Army arrives and proceeds to destroy
      and corrupt, with force and sly persuasion alike. The main character is Lucas, a young boy who must find out who
      wants to destroy the tranquility of Nowhere Islands and turn them into a high-tech nightmare.

      Mother 3 is a top-down role-playing game. The player character (the characters controlled by the player change
      often) travels around the Nowhere Islands with his party, talking to people and furthering the plot. It is
      possible to "dash", which not only allows to travel faster, but also allows to knock weaker enemies out of the way
      (or to ram some objects/characters).

      There are many enemies to battle in the game. The battles are turn-based; each turn, a character can attack with
      his weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic abilities, others have different special
      skills), use an item or try to run away. The battles feature a musical combo system, where tapping a button in
      rhythm with the background music will cause additional damage to the enemy. The characters have "rolling HP
      meters"; when they are dealt damage, they don't lose all the HP right away, but their HP decreases slowly; this
      way, even if a character receives massive damage, he can survive with only minor injuries if you manage to end the
      combat quickly. Winning battles gives the characters experience (and thus makes them stronger) and, later in the
      game, money (known as "DP"), which can be used in shops to buy better equipment or useful objects.

      There are many frogs encountered throughout the game, who serve as save points (and later as ATM machines). If all
      characters die during a battle, you can come back to life near the latest save point encountered and try again.

      There are a number of different modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of
      different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks
      require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners. The GP courses contain small
      differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game. Motocross requires the player to drive
      on off-road terrain and to master the act of "powersliding" on corners. The courses found in Motocross races are
      less hospitable and often take place in arid and unkept locales and with obstacles. Traffic mixes both GP and
      Motocross, having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles.</story>

    <story>In the game's Story Mode, players play Napoleon Bonaparte who leads the revolutionary army into battle
      against the British. Set in the late 18th century, Napoleon's story is told in Fire Emblem fashion via strategic
      maps and character dialogue. However, the game takes many liberties with historical accuracy, such as Napoleon
      fighting man-eating ogres and abominable snowmen. The objectives for the missions vary slightly, but the basic
      idea is to send out units, defeat the enemy and take over the opponent's stronghold.</story>

    <story>NFL Blitz 20-02 is a game based on the American Football sport. As the whole series, it takes away most rules
      and tactics (leaving 36 offensive and 18 defensive plays) while focusing on an action oriented approach. Because
      of the limited control scheme of the system, the options on the field are less in comparison to the main console
      version: besides the usual movement, passing and player moving commands, the player also may tackle, leap or
      activate a turbo boost. The playing perspective is an angled pseudo-3D view with the goals at the top/low side of
      the screen.

      Both in the exhibition and season mode (17 weeks), the game offers the choice between 32 teams with different
      statistics regarding passing, defensive and line. The mini games, which can be also selected from the main menu,
      are basically practice modes for field goal and goal-line situations as well as a NFL trivia quiz.</story>

    <story>NHL 2002 is the only entry in Electronic Arts' hockey series to be released on the Game Boy Advance. With the

      similar to the earliest titles in the series on the Genesis and SNES.

      Besides a standard mode for exhibition games, the game has a practice mode where the number of players on the
      field can be freely chosen. Season mode is unusual in that, unlike in other games, the player doesn't select a
      team to lead through a season. Instead, the game includes the full game schedule of the 2001-2002 NHL season, and
      any team in any scheduled game can be played. If no games of interest are scheduled on a given day, it can be
      skipped and the results simulated. The season mode also includes the ability to trade players, sign free agents
      and even to create players.

      The game also includes a multi player mode over the link cable, with up to four players able to join for

    <story>Young warrior, Onimaru is given the Oni Gauntlet as he rushes to defend his village from the demon hordes of
      Nobunaga Oda. Onimaru soon discovers from the old man Sandayu, that although he has been living in the peaceful
      province of Iga, he is of the Oni clan and had been secreted away. Additionally, with the power of the Oni
      Gauntlet, he can absorb the souls of enemies and use the demon Genma stones to recreate lost weapons and armor.
      With this new knowledge of who his is and of his destiny, he assembles a hasty squad of fighters including his
      sister Ororo and sets off to avenge his province and stop Nobunaga's demonic war upon the land.

      Onimusha Tactics is a turn-based strategy game between the player's side and the enemy's side. In each level you
      can bring a squad of no more than 10 people. There are no items to buy or sell, however equipment is available and
      customizable. Upgrades of existing weapons and armor can be done using the defeated souls of enemies absorbed into
      the Oni Gauntlet. New weapons and armor can be found or created through fusion of Genma Stones. Recipes must be
      found for each separate item before it can be fused.

      Most characters have a normal attack, the ability to use items and several special techniques for battle.
      Additionally there is an issen ability that randomly shows up and allows your character to counter-attack and
      instantly kill any enemy who foolishly attacks that character directly in the next round.</story>

    <story>Open Season for GBA is based on the movie and it is a completely different game experience than the console
      version. The story in the game follows the movie pretty well and it is well presented through in-game and comic
      dialog style cinematics. It's about a Grizzly bear named Boog who is very happy with his domesticated home. But
      one day he gets in trouble with his new friend Elliot and the town's authority decides to put them back in the
      woods where they belong. Unfortunately, for them, the hunting season has just begun and Boog has no idea how to
      survive outside of his garage home with his beloved caretaker, Beth.

      The game begins just before Boog and Elliot are dropped in the woods. You control Boog and he has many cool moves.
      He can jump, roll, grab and throw forest animals as well as roar. The goal of the game is to protect the forest
      animals from the hunters. The forest is full of hunters and boss hunters in each animal territory. It is your job
      to clean up the forest so play it wild and rally an army of forest critters in a hilarious quest to scare off the

    <story>The game continues the tradition of Tengai Makyou series, also known as "Far East of Eden". You play as
      either Tenran or Aoi, a teenage boy and girl, respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil that threatens the
      prosperous land of Jipang, to prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire Clan, warriors who have been
      protecting Jipang for many generations from evil demons and warlocks. The land Jipang is very similar to medieval
      Japan, and during your adventure you'll also visit Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries.

      The most important new feature of the game is a non-linear storyline. You can tackle many missions in any order
      you want, and the storyline also changes depending on the outcome of major battles. If you lose against a boss
      enemy, the game is not over, but instead, a branching storyline path is revealed. Otherwise, the gameplay is
      similar to other Tengai Makyou games, featuring overworld map traveling and first person perspective, turn-based

      3. Pac-Man Arrangement: Never re-produced outside of the arcade, Arrangement again uses the elements of the
      original Pac-Man and adds a fifth ghost, who can change shape and size when combined with the other 4 ghosts, and
      make life harder for Pac-Man. New power-ups are also included, like the ability to dash quickly around the screen,
      warp points to get from one place to the other and new ways of catching ghosts.
      Pac-Attack: Like Tetris before it, you must fit falling blocks together to complete a line to clear the screen. In
      this case, the falling tiles also have ghosts in them, and once the Pac-Man tile appears (a tile with the Pac-Man
      symbol), Pac-Man will eat all of the ghosts that are in his path until he gets to a dead end.</story>

    <story>Polarium Advance is basically the same as Polarium for the Nintendo DS, but a couple of new blocks have been
      added.

      This is a puzzle game in which the player must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or
      white). To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select the blocks in one line. In most puzzles,
      you can use the border to lengthen the line. The new blocks in the Advance version are: Hurdle Tiles, which you
      cannot pass, Multi-Tiles, which count as black or white, and Solid Tiles, which will not turn but are removed so
      that the tiles above them fall down. There are 365 puzzles in this mode (Daily Polarium) ranging from very easy to
      quite challenging.

      The Time Attack Mode requires you to solve either ten easy puzzles or five hard puzzles within the time given.
      Leaving a block of the wrong color in a line results in a 30 seconds penalty.

      It is possible to create your own puzzles and share them with friends. Puzzles created in the Nintendo DS version
      of the game are compatible with the GBA version.</story>

    <story>Power Pro Kun Pocket 3 is the third game in the long-running arcade baseball series for hand-helds and the
      first to appear on the Game Boy Advance. As a whole, it is part of the larger Jikkyo Powerful Pro Yakyu series
      also developed for the main console systems.

      The game includes a Success mode, where the baseball sequences are combined with a larger storyline introducing
      simulation and role-playing elements. Generally, the aim is to train a weak player to become one of the best,
      mixed with different intrigues. In this version, the player's character was once a famous high school baseball
      player who got killed. A doctor resurrected him as a robot and now he needs to go to three stages to regain his
      status. The first phase requires the character to get drafted with a team, in the second he needs to earn money to
      earn a life-long battery and the third and final phase requires acquiring a memory level of more than 80%. The
      character can go to his former high school and duel rivals in different mini-games.

      The player's character has HP, a stress bar and a memory bar, which are affected by various events. The player can
      do jobs to earn money and power-ups, restore health, date a girlfriend, train or mediate, suffer from illness or
      emotional trauma, and there is even an inventory with items and a screen with all the acquired abilities.

      Other modes are Exhibition, Arrange (create custom teams), Data and different mini-games. Playing against other
      people using a link cable is supported. The customization options are extensive, ranging from the amount of
      control the computer is given (hitting, pitching, running players, switching and fielding) to the different team
      and player statistics. Games consists of several innings where the player takes turns hitting and pitching. Most
      of the traditional game rules are followed.</story>

    <story>Power Pro-kun Pocket 4 is a 2002 arcade Baseball simulator developed by Diamond Head and published by Konami
      for the Game Boy Advance.

      The game's main feature is its Success story scenario, "Sunrise Highschool Edition", which follows a boy who is
      inflicted with a deadly curse after accidentally knocking over a memorial headstone. His friends start vanishing
      and his Baseball club is set ablaze. If he does not rebuild the club and win the Koshien tournament in three
      years, even he will be dragged into a vortex of oblivion.

      The player must manage the protagonist's weekly routine to train, recruit new teammates, fix the Baseball club and
      date one out of a few love interests. Failing the story's objectives or losing any late-game matches results in a
      game over which erases the player's save file. It is possible to reset the game to prevent that, but there are
      restrictions and penalties for doing so.</story>

    <story>Premier Manager 2004 - 2005 is a soccer manager where the player is responsibly for the athletic and
      financial success of his team. As usual there are a lot of details to take care of, e.g. searching for sponsors,
      stadium expansion, player transfers, lineup and tactics. But, as usual for English soccer managers, the emphasis
      is on the athletic aspect.

      The matches itself use an abstract presentation: The soccer field is shown in a top-down, tactical perspective and
      the player movements are shown with blue and red balls. It also features a new meeting system where the player
      needs to convince the management of his views before important decisions.</story>

      their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game
      of, Puyo Pop!

      A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining
      four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will
      fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be
      exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

      When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting
      the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you
      will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos
      to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

      Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows
      up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</story>

    <story>R-Type III was originally released only on the Super Famicom/SNES, but later ported to the Game Boy Advance.
      It was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force (which was now named
      the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R-Type Delta), the player could choose from two other
      Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special
      enhancements.

      It also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and
      the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to
      full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon
      called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave
      cannon if desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the
      ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The
      shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship
      burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must
      subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.

      The fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9Ø Ragnarök; it was originally referred to as
      'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic
      Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon. Final's version of the R-90 has the
      Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the
      R-9Ø2 Ragnarok II has the R-90's final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be charged
      through 7 loops. It can be assumed that this is because the original R-90 would simply be too powerful for the
      game to be any kind of challenge.</story>

    <story>This handheld racing game offers a range of licensed cars, several courses and circuits, and a challenging
      set of opponents. To these stock elements, it adds one more: weaponry. Now you can choose to nitro past the
      opponent ahead of you, or slow him down with a missile.

      With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks or choose a
      Championship Mode to progress through a series of circuits. After each race you'll need to spend some of the money
      you've earned (either by placing or picking up money icons during the race) to repair and -- if possible --
      upgrade your car. The upgrades can improve your car as a racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or
      as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon).

      The track design uses the isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. However, among the
      twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a
      leap of faith.</story>

      As with Wario Ware, the game is actually a series of shorter games bundled into one package. Before each game
      starts, you are presented with a short tutorial that gets you ready and practice before you begin the real thing.
      Control is normally very simple - usually, only the A Button is required, but some games make players press
      multiple buttons for different actions.

      Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown; pluck hairs off of an onion; march
      in time to an instructor; hit a baseball while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons
      as a samurai; and much more. At the end of each set of stages is a 'remix stage' - in this stage, sections of the
      previously played stages are combined and thrown at you at random, all while a single song plays.</story>

    <story>Based on the Blue Sky film (distributed by Fox) of the same name,
      Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot City to meet
      Big Weld, the famous inventor, he finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing and the evil Ratchet has
      taken over Big Weld Industries. With the help of his friends the Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet's
      villainous ways and restores order to the city.

      Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the player to
      locations from the movie like Robot City, Big Weld's Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame Gasket's Chop Shop. Using
      the invention mode, players build and upgrade Rodney's weapons including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper,
      and magno grenade. With a combination of navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players can make their way though
      the world of Robots and bring an end to Ratchet's tyranny.

      In addition to the main story line, players will find robots in need all over the city. The parts these poor
      robots are missing can be found hidden in the numerous maps and returning the correct part rewards the player with
      power-ups and weapon upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so players can easily find their way back to a
      previous area to uncover additional secrets.The maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, just like the
      transit system in the movie.

      The DS version of the game features a map that can be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of the transit
      ball game that utilizes the stylus for control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new features, the DS also

    <story>Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation is a semi-sequel to the previous games, Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun and

      Navi (initially available for selection are Mega Man, Roll, GutsMan and NumberMan).

      Unlike previous Battle Network games, you do not directly control your Net Navi. Instead, you can tell your Navi
      which enemy they should attack, as well as their attacking distance, and they will perform according to your
      directions. You can also select to use Battle Chips (from three which are randomly selected from your folder) by
      using the Control Pad to select the chip described at the bottom of the screen, then pressing A to use it.

      The game also supports a peripheral created specifically for the game, called the Battle Chip Gate. This
      peripheral plugs into your Game Boy Advance, and allows the player to send their Navi Battle Chips during battle,
      much like Lan does in the Mega Man NT Warrior anime. You can get additional Battle Chips when you purchase

    <story>The Smash Pack was originally released on Dreamcast as part of Sega's final system bundle before Dreamcast
      made its ride off into the sunset. Of course, as we all know, classic games never die and that's exactly what the
      smash pack featured. Because of that Sega and THQ announced that the Smash Pack would be making its way to Game
      Boy Advance. While the GBA version doesn't feature the exact same titles it does showcase Sonic Spinball (one of
      the lesser known titles), Ecco the Dolphin and Golden Axe.

      All three titles were classics on Sega Genesis in the early 90's/late 80's.</story>

    <story>Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the first game. The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years
      after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the
      Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of
      freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment
      named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the
      Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a
      demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they
      might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a
      better future begins...

      "Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse
      them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is
      turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</story>

    <story>Shining Force is a turn-based tactical RPG. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one
      square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move
      statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action:
      attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't
      count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.

      In Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality,
      much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no "generic" units, except on the enemy side, most
      characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.

      Each allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and
      equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon
      promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin
      higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.

      Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or
      landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle
      by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The
      Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and
      the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of
      their money.</story>

      Darkness. But as the Light grew more and more powerful, it upset the balance between Light and Dark and soon
      Darkness was on the rise once again.

      A prophet comes and warns the people of the impending dangers, but no one listens to him. Although his crystal
      shows the upcoming dangers, the people pass by without any interest. An agent of the Darkness, Gillespie, lures
      this prophet outside the city and kills him and shatters his crystal so the people remain ignorant of what is
      coming.

      This same agent gives the "Forbidden Fruit" to Deatharte, the trusted adviser to King Marcel in Klantol Castle.
      The adviser didn't trust Gillespie, but curiosity is a powerful force.

      It is now up to another hero to take on the journey to once again stop this growing Darkness. After choosing your
      character from 8 possible, you start out on his or her way to a tournament being held at Klantol castle. On your
      way, you meet an adventurer who will explain how to battle. Your journey then takes you to the castle to start the
      tournament.

      This tournament is interrupted when the king finds out his daughter is missing. The king's adviser heads out to
      find her, and the king asks that you go as well. It is here that your story really begins.

      The gameplay is similar to most RPGs of this type where the monsters are fought in real-time. An interesting part
      of this game is that your resistances will increase when used. Outside the castle, you can stand on a fire that
      will not damage your HP, but as your resistance reacts to the fire, it will increase slowly. Traps will also
      increase your resistance if you are hit by them, though you will also be hurt. Only the one fire is safe.

      Take on many monsters, cast spells, get new equipment. But most of all, save the world from Darkness.</story>

      friend using the GBA link. SHREK SUPERSLAM features 10 characters from SHREK and SHREK II, including Shrek,
      Donkey, Fiona, Puss-n-Boots, the Gingerbread man, and more. They will battle it out in 10 different levels, each
      of which is inspired by scenes from the movies and is fully interactive. Each character has a basic light and
      heavy attack plus throws and a unique slam attack that they can use once they build up enough power by hitting
      their foes. Each character also has specific strengths and weaknesses that will impact how players battle with
      them. Players can also grab weapons that appear on each level and use them against their opponents. There are a
      number of different modes in the game, including the single-player story mode, tutorial mode, multiplayer mode,
      and the mega challenge mode. Story mode allows players to unlock more characters, stages, and alternate outfits
      for the fighters. Challenge mode presents players with a challenge a race, a number of items to collect, etc that
      they must accomplish before their opponents do. More special characters and unlockable items are available for

    <story>In the Game Boy Advance version of Shrek the Third, you must complete levels playing as a combination of
      Shrek, Prince Artie, Puss in Boots, and Donkey. The levels are mostly puzzles, where you can only access certain
      areas with a certain character, so all playable characters must work together to all reach the end. Each character
      has special abilities, such as Shrek's ground pound to break through pits in the ground.

      You will encounter many different AI types throughout gameplay, including evil witches, arrow-shooting guys,
      gnomes, etc. There are collectible faeries in each level that you must collect enough of to progress to the next
      world.

      This is a simple platformer-puzzle game that is mostly geared towards children, seeing as there are no lives, and
      relatively simple combat, but it should also appeal to adults who enjoy the Shrek franchise.</story>

    <story>Snood is a puzzle game based on a simple idea, of the kind that was commonplace in the late 1980s. The game
      is set out with a grid of small differently-coloured shapes, each featuring faces drawn on them. A succession of
      blocks are placed in an aiming device at the bottom of the screen, and you must rotate this so as to aim them, off
      the walls if necessary, to hit ones of the same colour.

      When 3 or more of the same colour make contact, they are removed from the field of play. Any blocks which were
      only connected to those blocks (and not to any others or the ceiling) get removed from play as well. This is
      crucial, because each shot that fails to drop any blocks off causes a meter to move on one level. When this
      reaches the top, the line of blocks drops by one level. Once it reaches the point where blocks are moved down
      below the playing area, it is Game Over.

      There are five skill levels, as well as a set of 50 challenge levels, and a Journey mode in which you play through
      one level from each difficulty. From medium difficulty upwards, you'll have to contend with Skulls among the
      layout - these can only be removed by being dropped away.</story>

      Soccer Kid is a platform game with some unique elements. As the name implies, you have to kill your enemies with

    <story>Sonic the Hedgehog has arrived for his first ever adventure on a Nintendo console. Sonic Advance combines
      elements from the original Sonic series on Sega's Genesis, as well as from the Dreamcast Sonic Adventure series.

      Choose from Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, or Amy and take them through level after level of blindingly fast gameplay and
      ring collecting, dodging enemies in your path towards the final showdown with Dr Robotnik (aka Dr Eggman).

      Collect Chaos Emeralds along the way to transform into Super Sonic for added speed, and train your Chao to
      exchange them into Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the Nintendo Gamecube.

      And if that wasn't enough, you can also play 4 player battle modes with your mates, using one game cart between 4
      GBA's.</story>

    <story>Sonic returns for a second outing on the Game Boy Advance.

      Once again, Sonic is called upon to save the world from the evil Dr. Eggman. On this occasion, Sonic is joined by
      friends Tails, Knuckles and Cream and rabbit, the latest addition to the Sonic team. Each comes with a set of
      unique moves, allowing you to reach certain areas through-out the levels. However, unlike Sonic Advance, you must
      compelte the game as Sonic to unlock the other characters.

      Chaos Emeralds and Special Rings litter the stages. To collect the emeralds (transforming Sonic into Super Sonic
      for the final battle with Dr. Eggman), you must find the special rings hidden in each stage to unlock the bonus
      stage. Complete the bonus stage and the emerald is yours.

      You'll also get the chance to collect and raise chaos, and trade them over to Sonic Adventure 2: Battle on
      Gamecube, through the use of the GBA/GC link cable.</story>

    <story>Sonic Battle is a fast paced pseudo-fighting game akin to Super Smash Bros. Rather than being 3D
      side-scrolling, the game employs a 3D isometric view that is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons. The
      character sprites are 2D.

      There are 9 characters to choose from and 5 modes of play: Story, Battle, Challenge, Training, and Mini Games. You
      can link up 4 GBA's to fight your friends, and each character has several different attacks. It has a system of
      selecting Aerial, Ground, and Guard based attacks. Depending on what type of attack you set for which area
      (aerial/ground/guard) you have a possibility of 9 total different special attacks to choose from (only 3 at a time
      in a match though) which you can change each time you lose 1 stock point.

      The game includes a trainable character whose abilities and techniques you can raise and add to. You get to pick
      and choose every aspect of the robot's style (running, attacking, jumping, dashing, etc.).

      The game takes a moderate amount of time to play through as all the characters, and adds a longer lifespan to
      itself if you wish to play through and beat it completely (all characters, get all moves for the trainable robot,
      etc).</story>

    <story>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank." The Tank was based on
      alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been
      created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because the Invaders are
      back!

      Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this
      time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game stays close to its roots while adding many
      power-ups and enemies.

      You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and
      columns, at one of three skill levels. You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars,
      then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less
      common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in
      the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you
      can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several waves on each
      planet, you'll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the
      original coin-op.</story>

    <story>Spider-Man, the classic comic book co-created by Stan Lee, is now a major motion picture. This conversion of
      the movie to the video game world takes the major storyline, characters and artwork of the Spider-Man movie and
      adds a lengthy backstory and new characters.

      The Green Goblin is the main villian here, and as Peter Parker you must defy gravity using your spider crawl,
      web-slinging and spider-sense abilities to track down Spidey's nemesis through the skyscapers of New York City.

      The major inclusion for this title over the previous Spider-Man series (on Playstation also by Activision) is
      aerial combat. Attack the enemy mid-air while web-slinging, rise and decend while swinging and banking around
      buildings create a greater emphasis on Spidey's greatest asset, the spider web.</story>

      Bottom -- again! Someone has stolen King Neptune's crown and it appears as though Mr. Krabs is the culprit.

      volunteer to make the perilous journey to Shell City (a place no one has ever returned from) to retrieve the crown
      and save Mr. Krabs' life. Play as SpongeBob and Patrick together to pull-off awesome team moves like Parachute
      Shorts Gliding, Power Charge, Butt Stomp or Sponge Soak and re-live the movie as you find helpful friends and
      face-off against powerful enemies. Take the wheel of the "Patty Wagon" with SpongeBob and Patrick for a whole new
      driving experience and discover secret bonus areas, rewards and special hidden mini-games.</story>

    <story>One of history's best-loved arcade games shrinks down to fit in the palm of your hand. From the distinctive
      music to the climactic boat transformation, this translation does everything it can to replicate the original
      coin-op adventure, and loses none of the thrills. Driving the lightning-quick G-6155 Interceptor a vehicle that
      can switch from car to boat to motorcycle you'll try to destroy the N.O.S.T.R.A. organization before it destroys
      you. You'll use oil slicks, smoke screens, and missiles to knock your foes off the road, out of the air, and below
      the surface of the water. This version of SPYHUNTER actually serves as something of an update on the original, as
      there are seven real-world locales to test your resolve, and the gameplay is now mission based. The graphics have
      also gotten a bit of an overhaul, with visuals taking place in near 3D. Whether or not you had the pleasure of
      growing up with this game, there's nothing not to love about one of the original white-knuckle spy games.</story>

      exploits. But the scrolling platformer is only part of the experience. Spyro Orange focuses on dozens of
      mini-challenges for its gameplay, like a vertical shooter where Spyro floats around blasting sheep or collecting
      gems, a rapid-button-tapping challenge involving tug-o-war and ice cube creation, or driving around in a tank, or
      knocking out a series of bad guys in a Breakout-style challenge. The game supports link cable play for multiplayer

    <story>EA Sports returns to the slopes and the insanely fast-paced action of snowboarding with SSX 3 for the GBA.
      Combining racing with tricks, the game allows players to choose from different events and challenges as they
      desire. The story mode of SSX 3 involves, like the previous entries in the series, becoming the best snowboarder
      in the world. Players have a cast of characters to select from, most of whom have appeared in previous SSX games.
      Once players have selected their character, they're off to the slopes to start winning races and performing huge
      tricks. The main mode has 12 different events players can participate in. Players select the event they want to
      compete in from the map. There are races, super pipe, big air, and other events, and there's something for
      everyone. Winning these events nets the player cash which can be used to upgrade their equipment. In addition to
      winning the race, players want to look good doing it, and that's where the tricks come in. Pull off enough of
      them, and the player's boost meter fills, rewarding them with some extra power. Complete enough tricks and the
      character learns new, even more dangerous and impressive tricks. Gamers who love snowboarding will enjoy SSX 3.
      While players can't explore as freely as they can in the console version of the game, the racing is still intense,
      and the many different game play options keep the game from getting boring or repetitive.</story>

    <story>SSX Tricky is EA's follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use
      of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more
      aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These
      tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a
      super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's Tricky" to play.

      Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks
      contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return
      (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes
      by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" footage and a

    <story>Stadium Games is a olympiad style sports game where you can compete in these six events:

      3. Javelin
      4. Football
      5. Pole Vault
      6. Hammer Throw

      In the Shooting game, you have to shoot down pairs of clay pigeons that are shot in from the side. You view the
      event from a third person perspective, and have full control of the cross hair. The rest of the events are
      different. They all use timing meters, one for strength and one for accuracy, where the player has to hit the
      button at the right spot on the meter.

      Two game modes are available. Practice is the first, where one player can play any of the events at any time,
      without going through the rest. The second is the tournament where one or two players sharing the same machine can
      go through all the events. For each event the player will earn points, and there is a high score table for overall
      scores.</story>

      travel to Ice Cream Island to attend a horseback riding camp.

      * Adventure Mode features 9 side-scrolling or isometric action levels, basic plot-driven what-to-do puzzles and a
      horse friend that needs special nurturing.

      * Riding School Mode consists of the School/Tournament module allowing the player to take care of her horse much
      like popular

      * Horses will respond to care and nurturing in a positive way; accordingly, a neglected horse will become sad and
      tired.

      * Isometric levels feature an equestrian course with water hazards, bushes and fences in which the player runs
      time based trials in preparation for the Rescue Adventure.

      * Rescue Adventure is a journey in which the player collects items and power-ups, cares for her horse and follows
      clues in order to rescue animals.

      * Multiplayer mode supports up to 4 players, offering Polo matches and equestrian tournaments with courses that
      vary in difficulty.</story>

    <story>Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the
      series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and
      Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail
      since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.

      The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training
      and Entry.

      World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run
      into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three
      levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).

      Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds
      per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)

      Versus - Two human players battle it out.

      Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.

      Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes
      in the game (especially handy for Training).

      Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old
      favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.</story>

      The aim of the game is to remove all bubbles from the field, but there is another way of completing a game. Tokens

      The aim of the game, as with the previous titles in the series, is to remove a collected number of coloured
      bubbles from the game screen. To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the coloured bubbles from a
      launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same colour to clear
      them from the screen. If you're too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the
      game will end if it reaches the bottom.

      Classic mode features a number of bubble puzzles previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while Normal mode has
      some new variations on the bubble removing theme. Two players can also compete against each other.</story>

    <story>The game concept is that you have to eliminate clusters of at least 3 blocks with your mouse, but the more
      you remove at once, the more you score. Once that happens, all blocks above the ones, which have vanished, will
      fall down and close the gap.

      Beneath the lowest row, there you see the new row building up. Once all blocks are present, this row will be now
      the lowest row, while all others are moving up. Once one block reaches the top of the playfield, you loose.

      Each individual level has a preset value of rows, which will build up. To win a level, all you have to do, is to
      prevent that a full vertical row (from bottom to top) gets stacked up.

      The game offers 4 game modes: Traditional, Puzzle, Relapse, and Strategy. Two of them need a brain, while the
      other two just need a fast hand.

      Traditional works like explained above. New rows show automatically, with increasing speed not only from level to
      level, but also in a level. Means: the level starts slow, but in the end, new rows will complete every second.
      Power-Ups are available in this game mode.

      Relapse works exactly like Traditional, but with one major difference. The action isn't just limited to the bottom
      of the playfield, in fact, both bottom and top now filling with blocks. Power-Ups used on one side affecting both.
      How to win is the same, but you loose, when blocks from one side touching the other.

      Strategy is one of the two game modes where you must think. Clicking fast will only help to see the Game Over
      screen. New rows won't appear automatically, instead for each cluster you remove, a full new line will appear. So
      you have to plan carefully before neutralizing a cluster.

      Puzzle is the game mode, where no new lines appear. Also there are no Power-Ups here. But this is the most complex
      game mode. Your task is to completely remove all blocks, if at least one block is still available, you loose.
      There is also no time limit, so you can think as long as you want.

      The first three game modes offering bonus levels, which works like the Puzzle mode. So, if one block remains, you
      only scoring the normal points for removed clusters. Only when all blocks are removed, you score the bonus points.
      There are only two differences: it isn't so complex, and you only have 15 seconds time.

      There are 5 different Power-Ups in the game (2 good, 2 bad, 1 depending of the situation): Platform Block (won't
      move, just blocking the vertical row where it is), Indestructible Block (does move like a regular block, but can't
      removed with normal actions), Color Bomb (one of each of the 5 colors, will detonate all same colored blocks in
      it's big radius), Super Bomb (shorter range than the Color Bomb, but blow up all blocks, regardless the color;
      only way to remove Platform/Indestructible Blocks), and finally, the Gravity Block (only available in Relapse
      Mode, will shift all blocks from the side where it was activated to the other side).</story>

    <story>Go for a spin around Yoshi's island.

      Baby-sitting a whiny newborn is about as fun as a head cold on the first day of summer vacation. But when Baby
      Mario falls from the sky, the Yoshis seize the opportunity to do a lot more than change diapers.

      The big-hearted Yoshis vow to reunite Baby Mario with his twin brother on the far side of the island. It won't be
      easy, but the Yoshis are determined to take on a meddling Magikoopa and his entire cast of underhanded underlings.

      Brilliant game-designer Shigeru Miyamoto has crammed the island's jungles, caves and snowcapped peaks with one
      brain-bending surprise after another. Hidden rooms, secret passages, charming minigames, demented bosses and
      all-new pals await your discovery.

      Sure, Yoshi looks cute, but he packs some pretty amazing firepower. He can jump, hover, stomp, pound the ground
      and slurp up enemies. Best of all, he can throw eggs. Heck, Mario even gets to presto-chango into superfast
      Superstar Mario, while Yoshi morphs into a toy submarine that shoots itty-bitty torpedoes.

      As an added bonus, Yoshi's Island includes six super-challenging levels developed just for the GBA. You can also
      take a break from baby-sitting duties to indulge in multiplayer Mario Bros. action.

      In Super Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3, the unlikely duo of Yoshi and Baby Mario must together brave a
      world of infinite surprise and challenge. Richly varied gameplay, brilliant graphics and precision control
      perfectly meld in an adventure you won't be able to put down!</story>

    <story>It is two hundred years after the beginning of the "Space Era", a time period when civilization began
      expanding into space. However, by the start of the 21st century, two meteors struck and destroyed much of the
      Earth, sending humanity into chaos. By year 179 of the Space Era, secret technology, dubbed Extra-Over Technology,
      or EOT, was discovered by the Earth Federal Government within a third meteor that had hit Earth at the Marquesas
      Islands in the South Pacific. Dr. Bian Zoldark, while investigating the meteor, also found out that the creators
      of the Extra-Over Technology were heading to Earth to reclaim it. In order to defend earth, the government starts
      to develop a group of humanoid mecha, known as Personal Troopers.
      The alien race that created Extra-Over Technology, called the Aerogaters by the Earth Federal Government,
      initially attacks an Earth ship sent out to investigate their presence in the far reaches of the solar system.
      This initial skirmish ends in a defeat for the Aerogaters, prompting them to sue for negotiations with the Earth
      Federation Army. Talks are arranged to take place at a secret facility in Antarctica, but the talks are targeted
      by a rogue faction called the Divine Crusaders.
      The Divine Crusaders destroys the Aerogater delegation, then turn on the Federation forces. Bian Zoldark,
      revealing himself to be the leader of the Divine Crusaders, announces the existence of the Aerogaters to the world
      and rebel against the Earth Government. As Earth spins into civil war, a new Aerogater force is on the move,

      The cast of the game are all characters from the Tin Pin Alley series of bowling games. The game features two game
      modes: Practice Race, which is just the player racing around as he wishes, and Tournament Race, where the player
      competes against AI-controlled drivers. Throughout the game's tracks, the player will come across power ups that

      around. There's four different tracks in the game, each with its own layout and appearance, although the

      The game takes place in locales such as the International Rescue island, Africa, and even outer space. Each of the

      a level. Alan has strength and jumping ability, Tin-Tin has telekinetic powers that are used to move objects, and
      Fermat can hack computers and roll through holes. While the majority of the gameplay is primarily composed of

    <story>Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in the 2004 edition of the "best selling pro golf series".

      The biggest addition to this version is EA's Game Face, which lets you customize everything and anything. You have
      the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize
      every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more. You may also change individual
      body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs. You also have the option of choosing specific swing style
      animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and "pissed off" animations for when you score a triple bogey.

      One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships,
      and better gear. You can play for up to twenty seasons. The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win
      an opponent's clubs if you beat them. All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed
      Golf to a Skins Match or Practice.

      A new feature is the game's ability to read your console's internal clock, and provide you with game modes. If
      it's near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can

      Any fan of the classic cartoon series will go nuts for the near-perfect animation and familiar humor of the
      television show, but this game goes far beyond the call of duty. Between the long list of well-loved characters
      and the intense combat design, TINY TOON ADVENTURES: Buster's Bad Dream ranks among the Game Boy Advance elite.
      Make your way through four unique environments including Acme Forest, Haunted Mansion, Space Station, and a

      Bunny, Dizzy Devil, Buster, and all the rest of the gang appear throughout, and there are plenty of hidden areas
      and personalities to unlock. The game's team system is such that one player can stun or distract an enemy, opening
      the door for the other player to inflict serious damage. The relationship between cartoon characters and violence
      dates back a ways, and TINY TOON ADVENTURES isn't about to break up the love affair.</story>

      It simulates football matches through players taking turns to throw dice for attack and defense moves.
      Combinations are formed through multiple throws of three blue dice (attack). Further gameplay also involves a
      white one (more risk through double or nothing), a green one, and a red one (defense). The concept borrows some
      elements from poker dice with risk assessment based on retaining dice after the first throw. The gameplay involves
      different types of shots, but also penalties and foul cards (causing a player to wait a turn).</story>

      The turtles have grown apart, and Raphael has taken to crime fighting solo under the guise of the Nightwatcher.
      The Foot Clan are turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious man known as Winters seems to be involved with
      them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!

      The Game Boy Advance version of TMNT can be best described as similar to the NES game River City Ransom. Players
      take control of either a specific turtle or the turtle of their choice (depending on the mission), and fight
      through waves of enemies in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style. Enemies will drop the usual health pickups, but also
      drop money and weaponry. Money can be used to purchase weapons or upgrades between missions, while weapons can be
      used as a more powerful tool to defeat your foes (however, these weapons have a limited use). After the completion
      of a mission, experience is earned, and after a certain amount of experience is gained, you can level up the
      turtles to improve their fighting statistics.

      Each turtle has their own specific weapon: Leonardo with his dual Katana, Michelangelo with his Nunchucks,
      Donatello with his Bo Staff and Raphael with his two Sai. These weapons are used in their standard attacks. A
      basic attack is performed with the B Button, but you can perform different attacks with B and other buttons such
      as the directions of the Control Pad and the A Button. Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and more can be
      performed, and you can even juggle enemies in the air to get more hits in and increase your score.</story>

      In Career Mode, choose from one of 13 professional skaters and, in each level, complete various goals like
      collecting items, performing special tricks and of course breaking high scores by performing tricks and combos.
      Completing the goals earns money which unlocks new levels and can be spent on new boards, tricks and upgrading
      your skater's stats. In competition levels, you don't skate for money but compete for a medal.

      In the Free Skate and Single Session modes, unlocked levels can be practiced and new high scores be established.

    <story>THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision's ever popular franchise.

      The main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode. When beginning a level, you have all the time in the
      world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits.
      When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave
      Mirra Freestyle BMX. Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of
      points, transfer over this and grind that. There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while
      doing one big combo. Miss a trick, and goal fails. Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the
      Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.

      All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune
      Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa
      Steamer and Jamie Thomas.

      The levels are been expanded and are huge. Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the
      infamous prison complex Alcatraz.

      For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill.
      New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo. THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.

      The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your
      own network adaptor or the official one. The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro
      Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</story>

      the series, it's an isometric representation of the console levels combined with polygonal characters. It contains
      both a story mode, in which you create a rookie skater and take him or her on a world tour with pros to improve
      their skills and win prizes; and a classic mode, in which you must accomplish various goals such as tricking off
      objects or getting a high score within two minutes. Changes in this iteration include removing the timer from most
      goals in story mode, allowing you to have several active at once and new moves like the nata spin, tantrum, which
      allows you to recover from a bail without losing everything, focus, where you can slow time in order to land the

    <story>Top Gear GT Championship carries the official Japanese GT title and lets players race fast cars on different
      GT tracks. The game features two main game modes: quick race and championship. In quick race, players can alone,
      against another human player or create custom courses for the game. This is further divided into versus games
      against the computer and time attack. The game can also connect through mobile phones to check global rankings,
      enter local ranking entries, and download ghosts and new courses.

      In the championship mode, players need to complete the courses in a fixed order while a ranking is kept. The cars
      are shown from a third-person perspective and there are different AI-controlled racers to beat. Prior to the
      races, players can do free runs, qualify and eventually start the race or tune the car further. There are two
      weather types, sunny and rainy, which affects the handling of the cars.

      There are different cars and courses to choose from, with extensive tuning options based on the gear ratio,
      steering, brakes, tires, aerodynamic settings and the height handicap. There are also three difficulty levels.

      Trick Star is a futuristic racing game where the racers ride slick one-wheeled bikes. Players race along the
      track, with the goal of not only coming first, but also performing stunts to impress the crowds. Stunts cannot be
      performed until a certain speed is reached, and the "Trick Star" appears on the HUD. When it appears, players can
      perform a stunt by holding L or R, as well as any direction on the Control Pad. Performing stunts also fills your
      boost meter - when it is full, you can press L and R simultaneously to get an extra boost.

      In League Mode, players must complete three tracks, as well as scoring enough points to qualify for the Challenge
      Mode. Once the player has enough points, they can enter Challenge Mode, where they are asked to perform a
      particular set of stunts in between markers. When they succeed, they are rewarded with additional stunts and
      progress to the next set of tracks.

      Trick Star also includes one player at a time multiplayer, for up to four players. Players can compete in Time
      Trial (aim for the fastest time), Stunts (get the highest stunt point score), Long Jump (jump the longest distance
      along the track) and Challenges (complete the required challenges). After each player has had a go, the results

    <story>Pro Beach Soccer is the first game based on the Summer variation of football, played by five players aside on
      a sandy surface. The game includes 32 national teams (some with their real stars) plus 6 all star teams to be
      unlocked in 3 game modes (Exhibition, Pro Beach Soccer Tour and Tournament) played in Bangkok, Rio de Janeiro,
      Marseille or Venice Beach.

      Gameplay is classic arcade, with one button to pass, another to juggle the ball and another to shoot. One of the
      key aspects is the "State of Grace"; by making fancy moves (such as overhead kicks, heel passes or heading the
      ball back and forth) and scoring goals, a power bar starts filling, and when it's full, all team attributes are
      maxed up and the players are given the ability to quickly run with the ball.</story>

    <story>ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN is Activision's third SPIDER-MAN game and the first to be based off the comics rather
      than the new movies. The GBA game puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with
      Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15
      year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to
      sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their
      fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain
      known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and
      Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they
      accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall
      buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop
      Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like
      Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes. Fans of the comics will enjoy how ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN draws on the
      comic style and storyline, while movie fans will like getting to see another chapter in the Spider-Man legacy.

      make the right business decisions, and who your hard earned money should be spent on to purchase their help at a
      time of crisis in the ring. Wade's life and his car rest in your gloved hands.</story>

    <story>Wakeboarding is the new addition to the Activision line of extreme sports titles.

      A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the
      water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the
      wake left by the boat itself (hence the sports name).

      Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known
      locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have
      you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.

      Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull
      off the best tricks.</story>

    <story>This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld devices. At the screen you have a
      5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the
      holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while
      GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.

      The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach
      a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the
      standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush
      one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example
      ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which once active will
      give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are
      available, each with it's own graphical theme.

      The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate
      a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has
      two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so.
      The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles
      will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up.
      However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.

      The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what
      difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.</story>

    <story>It has been some twelve years since the destruction of Kilrah, the Kilrathi homeworld. The Terran
      Confederation, slowly demobilizing and reorganizing its military assets, has settled on a new strategy: building
      several Midway-class megacarriers, brainchild of Navy Commodore Christopher Blair. These new carriers, over a
      kilometer long, carry all the hardware and weaponry of a Kilrathi-War-era carrier battle group. The first one, the
      Midway herself, is undergoing her shakedown cruise, with Blair along for the ride. Before this, though, the player
      is treated to a CGI video of a bizarre rupture in space in the Kilrah system: the first of the Nephilim invaders.
      The game's titular prophecy involves the coming of these alien invaders, who shall arrive only after "one who has
      the heart of a Kilrathi, but who is not Kilrathi-born," conquers the felinoid warrior race.</story>

    <story>Winx Club is an action adventure game based on the Italian cartoon series of the same name. The story is
      similar to that of Harry Potter, only this time the main character is a fairy. She gets to go to a fairy school in
      fairytale world called Magix where she has to find her true self. This game is similar to the Windows and
      Playstation 2 versions, except that instead of a 3D third person perspective it features a 2D top-down perspective
      of the game world.

      This game loosely retells the story of the first season of the television series.

      There are "action" and "adventure"levels. In the adventure levels gameplay consists of finding items for specific
      NPCs and playing various mini-games. In the action levels the player has to jump, climb and fight enemies. The
      main character, Bloom, has a magic shield and two attacks that improve during the game. She can also cast a number
      of spells that can aid her in finding the items she needs. During boss battles Bloom changes to her Winx form in
      which she is more powerful and can fly. During the levels there are various items to be picked up which improve
      Blooms health or attacks or unlock new outfits that can be worn.</story>

    <story>Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts
      the player in the boots of B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete
      as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen
      before the events of the first episode) available in the "Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not need to
      be played in sequence to be enjoyed!

      In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a
      concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J.
      searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is
      given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant
      prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple
      goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal
      Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead
      researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans
      guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner
      for the chemical assault.

      Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden
      switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas
      with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach
      the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and
      even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and
      depending on the level, activate "push walls" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.

      Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo
      and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all
      of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level,
      while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is
      always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a
      nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually
      found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS
      Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of
      regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).

      Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends.
      To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing
      enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all
      secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).</story>

    <story>The gameplay is similar to that of Puzzle Bobble/Bust-A-Move, but with several key differences. There is a
      hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating
      in water. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that can be used,
      however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka. As with Worms, holding down the fire button
      increases the power behind the weapon's launch, affecting how far it will travel. It is possible to fire the
      bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an "arch", allowing players to reach
      difficult areas.

      Shooting blocks will have one of two effects:

      If you hit a block that is either the same colour as your bazooka missile, or is a rainbow block, that block and
      any other same-coloured or rainbow blocks connected to it will be destroyed. Any blocks that are not the same
      colour will not be affected; however, if the only thing holding those blocks up is the coloured blocks you have
      just destroyed, those blocks will fall into the water.

      If you hit a block that is a different colour from your bazooka missile, or is a "dead block" - an uncoloured,
      grey block - it will be recoloured to match the missile.

      (Weapons are affected differently by other blocks. This is covered further below.)</story>

    <story>Yu-Gi-Oh! returns in the form of a Tournament edition which will be used in an official Worldwide Tournament
      in 2004 in Los Angeles. The game also has a text translation utility that will allow gamers who link with one
      another to translate text automatically between languages. The languages included are Japanese, French, Spanish,
      German, Italian, and English. These are also the languages you can view the game in.

      The game continues the tradition of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card battles. There is little to the game other than battling
      your opponents. This game is a sequel to Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel and offers
      more than 1000 cards to use as well as new opponents. The game takes out some of the non-card battling features
      from the Worldwide Edition and leaves you with the battling as the main feature of the game.

      Build up to three decks with the cards you gain as you work to beat all your opponents. With over 1000 cards, you
      will have a wide range of choices for your 40-card decks.

      As with the Worldwide Edition, you can also trade your cards with friends through the Link Cable.</story>

    <story>ZooCube is a puzzle game that involves matching parts of animals to eliminate them and get points.

      The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a similar style to
      Tetris the player must keep the sides from building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later
      stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be
      used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make life more difficult for the player's opponents, such as by
      speeding up the rate at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can spin.</story>
