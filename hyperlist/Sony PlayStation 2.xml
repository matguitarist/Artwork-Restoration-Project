    <story>CIA agent Zoe Nightshade, a mole in Identicon Corporation, based in Hong Kong, is discovered and captured.
      Identicon, a botanical research firm, is a possible front for a weapons-smuggling ring. James Bond infiltrates the
      facility in an attempt to rescue her, as well as retrieve a suspicious courier case in the same building. After
      freeing Nightshade from a submarine set to launch, the pair flee the facility with the courier case. Nigel Bloch,
      the head of Identicon, has his forces chase the agents through the streets of Hong Kong. The two steal a second
      case of vials from a nearby Identicon factory. They then rendezvous with R, who provides Bond with a gadget-laden
      BMW Z8. A limousine pulls up, as an assassin inside launches a rocket at the agents, killing Zoe, and steals the
      case. Bond gives chase, stopping an armored van which contained the stolen vials.

      The vials contain nine blood samples, eight of which contained blood of world leaders. One contains the blood of
      British diplomat Reginald Griffin, serving in Romania, who is obsessed with protecting a room, outside of his
      jurisdiction, in the embassy. Bond investigates the embassy, finding Griffin dead, before a similar-looking man
      attacks him. After overcoming him, Bond finds a message from Bloch on Griffin's computer that mentions Malprave
      Industries, based in Switzerland. Bond takes the information from the computer and escapes.</story>

    <story>The gameplay is a mix of third-person shooting/action sequences and vehicle sequences. In third-person, Bond
      can move, take cover, aim and shoot with a lock-on system, engage in hand-to-hand combat, use his spy gadgets and
      perform some context sensitive actions. The lock-on system has a precision aiming dot that can be moved with the
      right thumb stick to target specific areas of the body. It does not snap to said specific areas making it possible
      to completely miss your target.

      A unique feature, "Bond sense", allows you to see the world how Bond does, allowing you to spot things that Bond
      can interact with. Using Bond sense slows down time so the player may have a chance to spot objects or enemies,
      but the player cannot move or take action without deactivating Bond sense.

      Two players can play through a co-op campaign that uses some areas from the single player campaign but adds unique
      scenarios and maps to the mix.</story>

    <story>Building on 007: Everything or Nothing's range of strengths, 007: From Russia with Love is based on the 1963
      film starring Sean Connery as James Bond. He is sent to Istanbul to acquire the Russian decoder machine known as
      the Lektor from a (supposedly) defecting Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova. However, the Russians have
      no knowledge of this plan because it is a trap for James Bond created by the criminal organization known as
      Octopus. It is up to James Bond to seize the device and confront the dangerous assassin Red Grant and the ruthless
      Rosa Klebb.

      In most of the 18 missions the player progresses through linear levels while shooting everything in sight. The
      player can lock onto an enemy at range and cycle between visible enemies, or focus in closer on a single enemy to
      make opportunistic targets appear, such as uncovered grenades or gaps in armor. Sometimes Bond can also use
      stealth or hand-to-hand combat, which are basically quick-time events where the player needs to press a displayed
      button in a limited time to dispatch a foe. Special tasks can be preformed with gadgets, e.g. the laser watch or a
      small remote controlled helicopter. This procedure gets spiced up with occasional driving or new jet pack
      sequences.

      The player gets rewarded for certain actions with bonus points, e.g. succeeding in melee combat or searching
      containers. There are three different kind of points which unlock different things: bonus content like making of
      videos, bonus levels, and weapon upgrades. Every weapon and gadget can be upgraded in different areas, but only
      once.</story>

    <story>A port of Sega's 2000 coin-op title, 18-Wheeler for PS2 has players hauling cargo across four separate routes
      while competing against a rival trucker. The four routes consist of New York to Key West, St. Petersburg to
      Dallas, Dallas to Las Vegas, and Las Vegas to San Francisco. Players race from a view inside the cab of their
      chosen 18-wheeler, each rated in speed, torque, and toughness, and must reach a series of checkpoints within a
      time limit to keep on trucking.
      Points are earned based on three conditions: the time it takes to reach the finish line, the amount of cargo left
      intact after hitting objects, and whether or not players finished ahead of their rival. Completing the route
      before the competition unlocks one of three mini-games where players are challenged to park in specially
      designated areas within a certain amount of time. Finishing the objective reveals a horn, muffler, or engine to
      boost an 18-wheeler's performance.</story>

      weapons.

      There are alternate mission types such as escort missions, car bomb, police escape (the only mode without weapon),

    <story>4x4 Evo is a racing game featuring real-life pickup trucks and SUV's. Actual trucks from manufacturers such

      The actual racing game is based very heavily on Terminal Reality's Monster Truck Madness series of games, except
      with SUV's instead of monster trucks.

      One significant feature of 4x4 Evo is the online multi-player option. The Dreamcast, PC, and Macintosh versions
      can compete against each other in 4 player online races.

      In addition to the on-line mode of play, there is a single player career mode. The career mode gives you a small
      allotment of money with which to purchase a truck. You then can compete in races to earn more money for more
      trucks or performance parts for your current truck.</story>

      appears on newer platforms, and has more trucks, and many more tracks.

      America. You can purchase a truck in career mode, and then trick it out with custom parts to turn it into an
      off-road monster.

      The career mode from 4x4 Evo is again the main focus of 4x4 Evo 2. This time, crazy missions provide for an
      alternative to the races found in the rest of the game. For example, you may find yourself using your truck to
      track down lost gold, or locate misplaced outhouses.

      The GameCube version features four exclusive tracks and four exclusive trucks.</story>

    <story>This game lets you step into the footsteps of 50 Cent himself. As he tries to free the kidnapped K-Dog with
      his crew in the streets of New York City, 50 gets shot nine times (just like his real-life counterpart) and left
      for dead. After getting stitched up, he sets out to find those who tried to kill him and uncovers a bigger
      conspiracy.

      The game is a 3rd-person shooter with all the typical features: You have a wide array of weapons (including akimbo
      shooting), there are over 25 moves to finish people off at close range, you can find money to buy health packs,
      armor, and other helpful items. You can grab enemies and use them as human shields and use mobile objects (like
      dumpsters on wheels) as cover. The game uses the havok physics engine for a more dynamic environment.</story>

    <story>Mature players explore the seven deadly sins as they seek fame and fortune in this Sims-style game of
      relationships from Monte Cristo. Throughout the game's seven chapters, which contain a total of over 60 individual
      missions, the player's character must use interpersonal skills to charm, intimidate, and otherwise manipulate key
      residents of the game's Apple City setting. By building relationships with these NPCs, players gain important
      information and access to new contacts, allowing them to network up the ladder of celebrity and gain even more
      power and influence.
      Unlike in the Sims games, players take direct control of their characters in 7 Sins, steering them through more
      than 20 different Apple City locations and having them meet as many as 100 different NPCs. Each NPC has an
      individual set of wants, needs, and worries; it's up to players to learn what these are and use them to their
      advantage. Player characters can improve their social skills with each successful encounter, acquiring a better
      sense of humor, civility, culture, or other social attribute which could make future encounters even more
      beneficial.</story>

      The Adventures of Cookie &amp; Cream is designed for cooperative gameplay with two players. The goal of each level
      is to get to the end in a limited amount of time.
      There is basically a straight road from A to B where the players have to overcome obstacles in their way. This
      includes standard platforming or puzzles which need both players to solve, e.g. one has to press a button so that
      the other can progress. Because the way is not the same for both characters the game uses a split-screen view.
      Power-ups increase the time limits but certain obstacles decrease it again if touched. There are overall 35
      levels.

      It is possible to play the game alone but then the player has to control both characters at once. The game also
      features a unique 4-player mode where each character is controlled by two people and one joypad.</story>

    <story>Aerobics is a form of physical exercise that combines rhythmic aerobic exercise with stretching and strength
      training routines with the goal of improving all elements of fitness (flexibility, muscular strength, and
      cardio-vascular fitness). It is usually performed to music and may be practiced in a group setting led by an
      instructor (fitness professional), although it can be done solo and without musical accompaniment. With the goal
      of preventing illness and promoting physical fitness, practitioners perform various routines comprising a number
      of different dance-like exercises. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and
      complexity. Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their
      fitness level. Many gyms offer a variety of aerobic classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of
      experience and taught by a certified instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class.</story>

    <story>In this tennis game with the endorsement of former world no. 1 Andre Agassi, the player has 32 players (all
      male, of which Agassi is the only real player), every one with their own strengths and 16 tournaments around the
      world, each with their trademark court (so you can count on Carpet in St. Petersburg, Grass on London, Clay in
      Paris and Cement on New York). Three game modes are available: Quick game (a simple game where the players sets
      all options, from location to the participants), Arcade (beating a series of games in a row) and Agassi
      Tournament, where the player competes for the No. 1 spot.

      Gameplay is simple, as usual in most tennis matches. There are four buttons, controlling a simple shot, lob, top
      and back spin, and to win points, the player must be positioned correctly and add the right amount of direction
      and strength into the shot (by moving the d-pad). Serving uses a power bar where the player presses a key to toss
      the ball, and the bar fills up as the best time to hit the ball approaches, when the player hits the button again.
      Like in Virtua Tennis there are two views, the usual TV camera and a "behind the player" camera. Unlike other
      games published by Cryo in the Roland Garros series, the camera does not change so that the player is always on
      the bottom court.</story>

      SUSPECTRA. Their plans are threatening the entire city, but Agent Hugo soon discovers there is even more at stake.
      The game is played as a platformer with racing elements. Agent Hugo can use the R.I.S.K. Aquapolis boat with
      heat-seeking missiles and nitro acceleration. It can also dive and regular weapons can be used. While avoiding

      disguises to stay undetected. When discovered, a meter starts to fill up. It can only be depleted by shaking off
      enemies and finding a hiding spot.
      During his mission Agent Hugo meets members of R.I.S.K, such as Agent 01 &amp; 02, professor W, Ms Alltobright and
      Honeybunny. Villains include SUSPECTRA chief Dr Nogo and the local bosses of the districts: Kizzi Mi, Oddjaw and

    <story>Airborne Troops: Countdown to D-Day is a third-person shooter with an emphasis on stealth action and
      commando-style tactics. Players take the role of lone soldier, behind enemy lines in occupied France during World
      War II. The game's missions are intended to re-create actual events that took place on or around the June 6, 1944,
      D-day invasion.
      About half of the missions are defensive, calling on the hero to use stealth to avoid capture; the other half
      offer more traditional shooter gameplay, as the hero goes on the offensive. All locations, uniforms, weapons,
      equipment, and medals are designed to be historically accurate.</story>

    <story>Fly with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Element squadrons as you defend country and, eventually, Earth itself from
      attack. Pilot aircraft that span sixty years of aviation including WWII prop planes, Korean War jets, rare
      prototypes, and even aircraft from previous Konami games like the Vic Viper and TwinBee.

      Between missions you can explore the base and talk to wingmates, buy new aircraft and special weapons, modify or
      repaint existing aircraft, and get mission briefings. Missions can have varied objectives, but any enemy crafts
      shot down will reward money used to buy, modify, and repair aircraft. While Ken Thomas is the main character of
      the game, other pilots can be used in missions as the game progresses, and using them can open up bonus missions
      as well as alter the story. The player can only play as Delta Squadron pilots, but the story is told from the
      perspective of both E.D.A.F.'s Delta Squadron and their O.C.C. Ace counterparts. Medals are awarded to each pilot
      as they reach milestones, such as number of enemy aces shot down or number of aircraft purchased.</story>

      The actual games can be watched real-time in 3D, allowing for on-the-fly substitutions and tactical decisions, and

      What sets the game apart from the crowd is its approach to driver abilities in Dynasty Mode. When setting a driver
      up, his abilities are split into skill areas such as reflexes and pressure-handling, with points assigned to
      these.

      Further skills such as Heart, Intimidation and Recovery can be developed to improve either car or driver. AI cars
      have the same features applied to them race by race.

      The driver's heartbeat is a featured sound effect, and in pressure situations it can be heard above all other
      sounds. One available skill is the Tiger Effect, which allows you to rewind the game to avoid dangerous situations

      in a plot which takes her from Saudi Arabia to Rio de Janeiro as she aims to find out about a mysterious device
      known only as "The Machine". The game was devised in conjunction with the writers from the show and uses official
      costumes, character shots and voices.

      Players can use a stealth or action approach to get through the levels. With stealth Bristow needs to hug walls
      and use the correct timing to approach enemies from behind and knock them out. To accomplish this she has a few
      gadgets to her disposal, e.g. thermal vision or mini cameras. For the more direct method she uses guns found on
      neutralised enemies or melee combat. The latter knows different fighting styles depending on which weapon Bristow
      uses, e.g. knifes, unarmed or even a broom. There are also basic puzzles to solve, e.g. opening doors or a hacking

      Level structure, mechanics of gameplay, and looks of the characters (Sarah, especially) sometimes differ strongly

      first for the series, it mixed skiing with snowboarding previously featured in the arcade game Alpine Surfer.

      The main game mode is the Extreme Winners Cup that features cross races, slalom, one-on-one and time attack. These
      largely serve to qualify for the tournaments. There are eight characters to choose from (one initially locked) and
      several courses. Each character has different statistics based on speed, turning and power. By winning races
      credits are earned to upgrade the snowboard and ski gear. Next to steering an additional button can be used to
      crouch and gain extra speed, but this limits movement. The same button is used in the air to perform tricks. The
      game can be played competitively against another player through a split-screen. Some of the equipment in the game
      comes from licensed manufacturers.</story>

    <story>Alpine Ski Racing 2007 is the sequel to both the Ski Racing series and RTL Ski Alpin 2006, but has overall
      more similarities to the latter. It's a downhill ski racing game.



      The game features three different difficulties and it comes with six game modes: slalom, giant slalom, super-g,
      downhill, free ride and speed-downhill. But the heart of the game is the career mode: here the player undergoes a
      whole season and tries to be as successful as possible - a good enough overall rank will cause a promotion to the
      next higher league for the next season. Before every event there are a number of possibilities, e.g. betting on
      the outcome and choosing the correct wax compound. Other important parts are to keep the financial balance and to
      train - a certain amount of training points are divided to the athlethe's abilities. If the player doesn't want to
      do this himself, he can hire a coach. The controls during the events consist of steering, accelerating and, if
      needed, carving for faster turns.



      There are overall 38 different races on 16 different peaks to ski from. Players can create their own athlete or
      choose one of the few pre-defined, which are modelled after real-life athletes, including Bode Miller and Hermann
      Maier.</story>

    <story>Alter Echo is a third-person action game with a focus on close quarters combat. It is set in the 29th century
      where a substance named Multiplast replaces all known construction materials because it can be formed into
      anything. But something is wrong on the planet Proteus, the only known source of Multiplast. Now the simple worker
      Nevio has to investigate and stop the megalomaniac shape shifter Paavo who controls an even more powerful
      substance.

      Luckily soon after the beginning of the game Nevo gets his hands on a special suit, which allows him to morph into
      three forms. The sword form is for melee combat, in which combos can be triggered by using the correct button
      combinations. The cannon form is a big robot which is more suited for gunplay and the stealth form is a futuristic
      lizard with a long tongue. During combat the player can instantly switch between the forms, which allows for many
      combinations depending on the former action or movement. This gets rewarded with plasma points which are used to
      upgrade Nevio's life energy, new moves or better weapons.</story>

    <story>Translated as Star of the Giants, Kyojin no Hoshi was an eleven volume manga by Noboru Kawasaki and Ikki
      Kajiwara that followed the path of a young boy who dreams of joining the Yomiuri Giants baseball team. Facing and
      surmounting self doubt, arduous training, and rivalries, Hoshi Hyuuma eventually reaches his goals and becomes a
      pitcher with the Giants. Similar to Ashita no Joe, the manga would eventually also hit the big time with anime
      episode productions. Hoshi owns some batters by performing something called "Big League Pitch #2" where his leg
      kicks up a cloud of dirt on the mound, obscuring the hitter's view as the ball zooms towards him. One memorable
      episode of the anime is built around a single pitch from Hoshi to batter.</story>

      monkeys in the levels are somewhat unique with their own character abilities and their unique name. Some monkeys
      just sit on their place, while others attack you with projectiles or run away quickly.</story>

      and perform a powerful attack or a gun fighter and shoot em up or a ninja and run along walls. You can also

    <story>Aileen Olazabal, is the only daughter and princess of Gilkhatar who wants nothing more than to lead a normal
      life and not be a princess. However, nearing her birthday, the king and queen decided that she should marry, and
      that they had decided on a husband for her. Wanting to have a normal life (which includes having a normal romance,
      falling in love etc.), Aileen refused. This led to a wager between Aileen and her parents; if Aileen could raise
      10,000,000 Gils in 25 days, she would be free to do what she wanted. If she failed, then she would have to do what
      her parents said. The king then told Aileen that there were six young men she could ask as companions.</story>

    <story>SCE takes the Arc the Lad series away from its roots and into an Online-playable action-adventure game.
      Players become a hunter who must travel the world and take on jobs, usually revolving around taking out enemies in
      real time using magic and special abilities. Collect cards from battle and events and equip them to gain new
      skills, all the while following an RPG-like storyline. You view the action from overhead, with a camera zooming in
      and out depending on the intensity of the action and occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect.
      You attack enemies in real time, tapping X once for a simple attack and repeatedly for a combo. You can also guard
      against attack, dash at an enemy, and press a button to run about the play field faster. The game places heavy
      emphasis on magic use, with the magic meter recovering automatically and quickly following each spell.</story>

    <story>Arc: Twilight of the Spirits is the fourth entry in the Arc the Lad series. Like its two immediate
      predecessors, the game has tactical battles which allow free positioning and movement of the characters on the
      combat field. However, the game is closer to being a "regular" Japanese-style role-playing game rather than a
      tactical RPG. The player controls a relatively small party (up to six active combatants), and is able to explore
      towns and dungeons in a standard RPG fashion. In the beginning, the game puts the player into control of Kharg,
      but afterwards the chapters alternate between the human hero and Darc, each with his own party. Characters can use
      a variety of techniques, accumulating SP (spirit points) in battles and them using them to learn special attacks.

      There are two things that Yuna cherishes most, the taste of Pescatore and the memory of the boy who made it. The

      Realizing that this is the place where she can be close to her inspiration and sharpen her cooking skills, she
      applied for an internship there. But before she get the position, she has to pass a cooking test with two other

    <story>Arctic Thunder, the fourth installment in Midway's arcade racing series, is a fantasy snowmobile-racing game
      that plays like a mix of Cruis'n and a kart racer on ice. The main object of the PS2 and Xbox versions is to
      upgrade sleds and unlock secret characters or tracks. You earn Gold Medals or lots of points to unlock most
      secrets, and you do this by winning races. The gameplay involves shooting down enemies with weapons, boosting
      yourself ahead, and pulling off tricks. Exclusive to the console versions is a Battle Mode that emphasizes the
      game's frantic combat.
      Like other titles in Midway's pseudo-series, such as Hydro Thunder and 4 Wheel Thunder, this snowmobile racing
      release combines distinctive environments and a responsive physics model with lots of arcade-style jumps and
      power-ups. Players race their snow machines across the Swiss Alps, up the Alaskan Pipeline and even through a
      nuclear energy plant in Chernobyl in a continuing effort to be first across the finish line. Also like others in
      the series, Arctic Thunder is full of extra sleds, tracks, and other secrets to be unlocked through skillful play.

    <story>Inspired by the 1995 coin-op by Atari Games, which featured alien-blasting action with a light gun
      peripheral, Area 51 on PlayStation 2 once again finds players deep within the mysterious military base. Players
      assume the role of Lt. Nick Cross, a biohazard expert sent to investigate the strange happenings inside the famed
      research center. Cross soon resents his assignment, however, after being infected by a virus of alien origin. Now
      he finds himself slowly developing new abilities as a result of the alien DNA strands bonding with his own. Area
      51 has been redesigned as a first-person shooter without the weapon peripheral, meaning players are free to
      explore the top-secret installation on their own without following a scripted path.
      Of course, players will be armed to the hilt with high-powered rifles, infrared sights, grenades, and various
      other tools of the trade. Along the way, secrets will be revealed in the areas of alien autopsies, cover-ups
      involving lunar landings, and experimental work on advanced technology like cloaking devices. With newfound
      superhuman strength and other biological enhancements courtesy of the virus, Nick Cross must battle aliens,
      soldiers, and other surprises while also solving puzzles. Area 51's creatures were designed by Stan Winston
      Studio, the effects team behind such films as Aliens, Predator, and Jurassic Park.</story>

    <story>Arena Football is a simulation of the sport of the same name. It shares many similarities with the Madden
      Series, whose engine it uses, but has a different play-style thanks to Arena football's rather different rules.
      The game is played indoors with teams of eight on a 50-yard field and the sidelines and uprights have barriers to
      make balls that would go out of bounds in standard American football bounce back into the play field. It is still
      considered live at this point. Obviously, this makes the game much faster-paced and higher-scoring.

      Features include a coach's pick which will recommend plays, a telemetry view, which lets you see how tired both
      your players and the opposing ones are along with passing routes so you can set good match-ups, a quick play mode,
      a season mode, which allows you to go up to 20 seasons and trade players, set salaries, etc, practice and online
      play.

      Arena Football is officially licensed by the Arena Football League and includes all the teams and players from the
      2006 season. New Orleans VooDoo is not included as they sat this season out due to hurricane Katrina, though their
      logo is available to use for created teams. Numerous historic teams are also available.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>Army Men: Air Attack 2 and its predecessor are shooting games similar to the ones in EA's Strike series. The
      player controls a green toy helicopter through a suburban setting. The aircraft is equipped with weapons and a
      winch. At the start of each mission, the player can choose the helicopter model and its co-pilot (whose
      characteristics modifies the behavior of the airship. For example, a specialist in guns increase the accuracy of
      shots). The mission objectives vary: there are rescue missions, where the winch is used to collect a character or
      object, demolition missions, where something has to be destroyed, and escort missions, where something must be
      protected from enemy attacks.</story>

      the aid of a magical sword called the Azure Azoth, Felt sets off through a gate to another world called Belkhyde

      In order to create a new item, Viesa will need a recipe indicating what ingredients to combine as well as those
      ingredients. All of these items can be found in various locations throughout the lands, some in Eden and some in
      Belkhyde. Many of the items Viesa can create with alchemy will be of great help to Felt as he explores Belkhyde
      and fights in battles; since Felt doesn't have the ability to create items, they will need the help of a share
      ring which provides the ability to exchange items even though they are in two different worlds. To progress

      making battles easier. As Felt explores Belkhyde, he will meet numerous other characters and will need to undergo

    <story>ATV Offroad Fury 4 is the fourth and final game in the 'Offroad Fury' franchise, released on Playstation 2.

      Unlike the previous three titles in the series, this game strays from just simply ATV's in it's roster of
      vehicles. Offroad Fury 4 introduces MX bikes, dune buggies, and trophy tricks into the mix. The game also differs
      from it's predecessors in that it includes long point-to-point tracks, which utilize streaming technology to
      immerse the player in a huge seemingly-endless world. The other notable departure from the previous titles is the
      inclusion of a career mode, which attempts to include a story between races using rendered cutscenes.</story>

      to maintain at any given time. Hit the right notes for the right amount of time, and you'll get high scores.

      As the focus of the game is the TV show atmosphere, special attention has been paid to select a great variety of
      video clips of judge comments and special performances of the show. This way, players need to struggle to achieve
      a good result and are awarded with special contents from the show. The game also contains Party modes in which
      players compete by playing a selection of funny mini-games.

      The game is bundled with a USB microphone.

      The tracklist of the game features songs like Wasabi (Lee Harding), Do It With Madonna (The Androids), 4ever (The

      Before a race the tires, downforce, and suspension of a car can be modified. During a race cars take damage from

    <story>Backyard Baseball '10 is a baseball game that features all 30 Major League Baseball teams as well as 11
      "Backyard" teams (6 in the DS version). The player can pick a team, players and one of the 12 different fields to
      play on. The game combines traditional baseball mechanics such as pitching and batting with the ability to use
      power-ups.

      Some of the power-ups include:
      Screaming Liner - The ball is hit so hard it screams
      Orbiter - The ball cannot be hit any harder; almost a guaranteed home run when hit
      Popcorn Bunt - Confuse the defense by making a bunch of other balls appear on the field
      Slime Ball - The ball is covered in goop and no one can catch it or throw it
      Free Radical - The ball bounces around a few times, making it really hard to catch
      Teleporter - The ball teleports on the field a few times before stopping somewhere on the field
      Static Zing - The ball is electric and will shock the first person to touch it
      Meteor Ball - The ball is thrown so fast that it's hard to see!
      On the PlayStation 2, the game uses traditional button-based controls. On the Wii, the player can swing the
      Wiimote to bat and pitch. On the Nintendo DS, there are two control modes. The player can either use the control
      pad and the B button or tap/swing the stylus on the touchscreen to pitch/bat.</story>

      This dating game is aimed towards girls and is more story driven. It goes on the premise, what if there was a lone
      girl in the Shinsengumi? What will happen? It is also follows certain events in Shinsengumi history like the Sumo
      wrestlers in Osaka, Serizawa's assasination, the raid at the Ikeda-ya and so on. Undoubtedly there is blood shed
      and relatively "mature" themes, thus the game has a rating of "for ages 12 and up".</story>

    <story>The Bard is a cynical, opportunistic musician who roams the country in search of carnal pleasures. However,
      this impatient and selfish fellow is compelled to accept the greatest quest of his life: save the princess Caleigh
      from a demonic cult that has kidnapped her. The unlikely hero must now explore the land in search of the princess,
      accompanied by the omnipresent Narrator who obviously can't stand the Bard and uses every opportunity to
      sarcastically comment on his actions. Furthermore, Fionnaoch, the mysterious abductor of the princess, does
      everything he can to stop the Bard, sending his minions after him.

      A self-proclaimed "quest for coin and cleavage", The Bard's Tale is an action RPG that is more of a whimsical take
      on role-playing games than a remake of the classic series. As the Bard, players can fight off hordes of foes with
      blade and bow, and summon companions through magical Bard Songs. Leveling up allows the player to raise the
      character's main attributes and invest specialization points in the different types of weapons he can use. Magical
      companions must be sought out and then summoned during battles. After being summoned, they act pretty much like
      AI-controlled party members; some of them specialize in physical attacks and offensive spells, while others can
      heal the hero.

      During conversations the player can choose "nice" or "snarky" responses for the protagonist. While mostly used for
      humorous effect, some of these responses may affect subsequent events. The game uses the Dark Alliance engine and
      has a similar camera and control scheme.</story>

      remote areas, survey situations from a safe location, and unleash surprise attacks. The film spotlights its

      from the Gundam Seed anime, including grunt mobile suits like GINNs. However, the Wing Gundam Zero Custom,
      Tallgeese III, Burning (God) Gundam and Master Gundam appear as unlockable secret characters. It was only released
      in the US.

      It was built off of the original Gundam Seed game for the PlayStation 2, but modified from an action game into a
      3D fighting game.</story>

    <story>In the future, on the planet Allium, the situation has become desperate. This world has suffered from global
      warming, causing the polar ice caps to melt. The rising sea has resulted in the amount habitable land to decrease
      dramatically. All that is left are island chains, making land the most valuable resource on the planet. The entire
      population must survive and compete over these islands.

      Currently, there are two distinct civilizations on Allium, settled into an uneasy cease-fire. There are the
      scientifically advanced Forseti and the aggressive Muspell. The Forseti have recently developed the most advanced
      combat vehicle in existence, the Battle Engine Aquila. The Aquila is both a four-legged mechanized tank and a
      combat jet, it is capable of switching modes at will. Players take the role of Hawk Winter, a Forseti cargo loader

    <story>Battle Gear 3 (???Â·??3 Batoru Gia Suri?) is a 2002 arcade online racing game released by Taito and based on
      real Japanese locations such as Hakone and touge races on board tuned sports cars licensed by famous Japanese
      makers including Nissan, Toyota and Mazda. On December 15, 2003, Taito released an updated System 246 version
      named Battle Gear 3 Tuned (???Â·??3Â·??????) and featuring seven extra cars including the Mazda RX-8 Type-S (SE3P)
      and the Nissan 350Z (Z33). Also, four new tracks (the B courses) including a secret one, were added, as well as an
      exclusive "Takumi Mode" ("????"?). The Takumi Mode gives the player a finishing time/reduced speed penalty each
      time the car hits a wall. The purpose of this feature is to offer a more realistic and artistic driving experience
      dixit the developer himself. This principle was used one year later by Polyphony Digital in Gran Turismo 4. By
      Christmas of the same year, Nextech Entertainment ported Battle Gear 3 to the PlayStation 2 with an opening CG
      movie, an exclusive "Event Race" online contest mode and some extras from the updated version, consisting of four
      cars (D-Class) and two courses (B).
      The Battle Gear (BG) franchise has a popular following in Asia due to the continuation of the Side by Side
      (???Â·??Â·????) arcade and PlayStation 1990s series. In late 2002, a PAL version of Battle Gear 2 was licensed by
      Midas Interactive and published as Tokyo Road Race in Europe and Oceania. Both "Net Ranking" and "Network" modes
      were removed though. By July 2005, Battle Gear 4 was launched in Japan on Taito's latest 2.5 GHz CPU based Type X+
      system board. This new episode introduced official tuned cars such as the Nismo Fairlady S-Tune Z33, Nismo Skyline
      S-Tune R34 or the Apexi RX-7 FD3S (D1GP'05 version), and even licensed European makers for the very first time.

    <story>Beat Down - Fists of Vengeance is a 3rd person action/fighting video game for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It
      was developed by Cavia and published by Capcom, and released on August 23, 2005. In it, the player takes the role
      of any of 5 gangsters, running from their boss. The player earns respect on the street by fighting enemies to take
      down a shadowy organization and become the city's ultimate fighter.
      An urban fisticuffs adventure, Beat Down: Fists of Vengeance casts players as a fugitive in the fictional city of
      Las Sombras, a dangerous place ruled by rival cartels. Players choose one of five hardened mercenaries, who were
      all betrayed in the same drug bust-gone-wrong. In order to redeem himself, the player's character must learn the
      ways of the city and its diverse neighborhoods, make alliances and gain followers, eventually rejoin with the
      other fugitives, and ultimately hunt down their betrayer and serve him his due.
      While strategy, diplomacy, and disguise have their place, the game's action revolves around street fights of many
      sorts. The player's character can pick a fight with nearly anyone he meets, and use found objects as improvised
      weapons.</story>

    <story>beatmania IIDX is very similar to the previous beatmania games, with the distinct difference of the
      controller having seven keys -- four white and three black -- compared to the original series' five. In each song,
      color-coded notes scroll from the top of the screen in time with the music, and the corresponding keys must be
      pressed at the correct time to play along with the music. Good timing will increase the player's Groove Level,
      while poor timing or missed notes will decrease it, and the goal is to have the Groove Level above a certain level
      at the end of the song.

      There are three main modes in the game. Arcade mode is presents a selection of so-called "courses" which consist
      of five songs each, which must be cleared in order. Free mode allows any track played in Arcade mode to be freely
      replayed. Practice mode is exactly what it sounds like: a practice mode where songs or sections of songs can be
      practiced without any risk of failure. There are also a large number of unlockable songs and courses, and numerous

    <story>beatmania IIDX 5th style is one of the many titles in Konami's IIDX rhythm game series, featuring more than
      60 tracks, primarily from the arcade version of the same title. As usual for the beatmania series, the player is
      given seven piano keys and a turntable, and must play along with the notes that scroll down the screen to play the
      music. There are three main modes: Arcade mode tasks the player with completing several tracks in succession, Free
      mode lets the player freely play any unlocked song, and Practice mode lets the player practice parts of songs
      without danger of failure.

      New in this edition are two additional training modes. Beginner's Mode offers extra-easy 7-key versions of each
      track, simpler than even the Light-7 versions available since 3rd style. Drill mode offers a selection of specific
      challenges designed to help players improve their performance. Unique to this release is the ability to install
      game data to a PS2 hard drive to decrease loading times.</story>

      The mice later mysteriously lose contact with Stoker, so another general, Carbine, sends the Biker Mice from Mars.
      After their arrival, they land in Chicago and meet up with Charley Davidson, who runs and owns the Last Chance
      Garage, which becomes the Biker Mice's base of operations. Not long afterwards do they realize the Catatonians,
      led by General Hairball and Cataclysm, have come to Earth in search of Stoker, so that they can ensure their claim
      of the Regenerator. Evil billionaire Ronaldo Rump (a parody of Donald Trump and Ricky Ricardo with an oversized

      Toa Inika - Jaller, Matoro, Hahli, Kongu, Hewkii, and Nuparu. These heroes wear Toa Masks of Power - power-ups
      that can be found throughout the levels to gain different elemental based abilities. There are also Bionicle

    <story>Newton's third law is put to the test in Black, a first-person shooter from the development team behind the
      acclaimed Burnout franchise. Players are cast in the role of Jack Kelar, member of an elite tactical squad, whose
      team is assigned to Eastern Europe on a hunt for an American traitor. Rather than slinking through environments
      making quick, covert strikes, players in Black perform a full-on assault through nine levels of explosive action.
      A total of 13 cutting-edge weapons are available to eliminate the enemy threat, but the most distinguishing aspect
      of Black is its physics engine: fully destructible environments allow players the freedom to shoot inanimate
      targets as well as live ones. Instead of firing at a patrol of soldiers, for example, players can instead target
      nearby vehicles or barrels to trigger explosions, shoot out windows and balconies, and more. As Kelar blasts
      through the besieged cities, snow-covered wilderness, and other levels, shell casings, glass, dust, and debris
      will fly across the screen as plumes of smoke and raging fires dot the war-torn landscapes.</story>

      Based on the manga of the same name, Bleach tells the story of an average high school student named Ichigo
      Kurasaki. Unlike his other classmates, however, Ichigo can see beyond the world of the living and into the spirit
      world. Not too long after he discovers this power, Ichigo is greeted by the female God of Death, Rukia; who then
      transfers her magical powers into him by accident and thereby connecting the two forever. From that day forward,
      Rukia and Ichigo set out on an adventure to seek out fallen spirits known as 'Hollows' and perform soul burials in

    <story>Blitz: The League is the first football game with no NFL license in many years - because EA signed an
      exclusive deal with the NFL, Midway developed one without the license. The game has 17 fantasy teams all with
      their own look and feel - from personalities to logos.

      The game differentiates itself further from official games by giving the players an off-field presence, often
      involving sex, performance-enhancing drugs and violence. The game has input from the writer for Playmakers, the
      football-based soap opera the NFL forced ESPN to cancel.

      Blitz: The League has 8-man teams, and makes spectacular action-packed moves easier than in real life. Impressive
      moves boost your Clash meter, which allows you to pull off unrealistic moves, such as easier running due to Bullet
      Time, and some brutally tough defences tackles. If these tackles happen frequently enough the players will fight
      hockey-style, lunging into wild tackles. The team with the most tackles from this gains the Unleashed mode, which
      has even more gruesome moves, of a style the NFL would not allow to be associated with their product.

      Additional features include multiplayer action with head-to-head online play and complete customization options of
      players, teams, stadiums and more. Lawrence Taylor appears as the poster boy.</story>

      move him in different directions, attack, jump, use "dark gifts" and grab on to ledges. Kain's life energy
      steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living
      creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is
      filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by
      defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile
      telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform "stealth kills" which
      will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and
      other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from
      afar.</story>

      Battle Mode is the centerpiece of this and all other Bomberman games. This mode is essentially the standard
      Bomberman formula; in the game, players navigate grid-based mazes, planting bombs in an attempt to hit other
      players (while avoided being hit by a bomb themselves). There are several different variations of Battle Mode,
      although they all center around the standard Bomberman gameplay.

      Classic Battle: A standard deathmatch-type game.
      Star Battle: Collect the most stars.
      Crown Battle: Find the crown in the level to win the game.
      Point Battle: Earn the most points by killing opponents

    <story>Boogie is a dance and Karaoke game. Unlike most similar games, which use special pads to control the dancing,
      the Wii version makes use of the Wii remote. The nunchuck can also be used to control the facial expressions in
      Strike-a-pose sequences, but is not required. For karaoke, Boogie includes a USB microphone. Each song can be
      played as a dance or a karaoke game. Players either match the rhythm and pitch, or match the song's beats to
      dance. Variation and combos are encouraged, as too many similar moves will lower the score. By performing well in
      the dances, a Boogie meter is filled. When full the player can execute a special move. While dancing, bonus items
      appear such as multipliers, tokens and meter boosts.

      The game features a story mode centered around an intergalactic singing and dancing competition. There are five
      different characters, each with a unique story. For all other modes of play, players can create custom avatars
      based upon the five base characters, with a chapter in the story mode for each of them. Token collected during
      gameplay can be traded in for new songs, stages and outfits. There is also a mode where players can manipulate the
      camera to record their own music videos.</story>

    <story>Since the appearance of Goemon on the Nintendo 64 and now the PS2 in 3-D depth and adventuring, it just
      doesn't seem the same anymore. There is something lacking. Perhaps it's the clumsily drawn graphics or the dodgy
      controls when you attempt to master Goemon's movements. The PS2 version of Goemon's new 3-D adventure looks
      superior to the Nintendo 64 version but it's still not as sharp as other 3-D games that are out on the PS2.
      The first PS2 title in the Ganbare Goemon series,aims to re-invent the Goemon series once again by giving the
      title a stylistic and gameplay makeover. Goemon has been redesigned to resemble a more realistically proportioned
      (and behaved) teenage warrior, and the game-world and NPCs had most of the wackiness removed to accommodate a more
      straightforward gaming experience.</story>

    <story>Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter is a radical departure from the previous titles of the Breath of Fire series,
      and in some ways from standard Japanese-style role-playing games in general. The game is built like a huge dungeon
      crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is tactical: each character has action points (AP), which can be used
      to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in
      the game, and many of the items found in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on
      who first initiated a physical contact, the party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles.

      The game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart it from the beginning, keeping the items and the party
      experience. The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation
      abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is
      over. Raising the D-ratio allows characters to access new areas every time the game is replayed.</story>

    <story>Broken Sword - The Sleeping Dragon is an adventure game released on Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2003,
      while in Japan, the PlayStation 2 version (released only in Europe and Japan) was released in September 2004. A
      Nintendo GameCube version was planned, but was cancelled. It is the third instalment in the Broken Sword series,
      released six years after the previous instalment, The Smoking Mirror. The Sleeping Dragon moved the series to 3D
      graphics, and is the only game in the series not to use a point and click interface. The player assumes the role
      of George Stobbart, an American patent lawyer who flies to the Congo to write a patent for a scientist who claims
      to have found a source of unlimited energy.
      The idea was first discussed in 2000. To make the game feel like a film, Revolution brought in a cinematic
      consultant, Bob Keen, who made sure the game conveyed emotions and atmosphere appropriate for each scene. The game
      was originally planned to have similar cartoon-quality visuals as its prequels, but the developers decided to aim
      at a style similar to Japanese animated films. Unlike the first two Broken Sword games, which used the Virtual
      Theatre engine, The Sleeping Dragon was built with the RenderWare engine. The game's music was composed by Ben
      McCullough, and Rolf Saxon returned to voice George Stobbart.</story>

    <story>The story is essentially told as a "reflection" on the events that took place earlier, as Army historian
      Colonel S.L.A. Marshall is interviewing paratroopers 15+ days after D-Day. The story is divided into three parts.
      The first part of the game is recollection of Hartsock's time in Sergeant Matt Baker's squad during the initial
      D-Day invasion. The second part picks up when he takes command of 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon during the liberation and
      defense of Carentan, and the eventual link up between 82nd and 101st Airborne Division at the town of Baupte. The
      final part will take place in and around Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. Although the first part takes place under
      Baker's command, every mission is one not included in Road to Hill 30. The player commands Desola, Allen, and
      Garnett from 3rd Squad, and some soldiers from 2nd Squad at first. Then the game switches the player to command
      the entire 2nd Squad after the Battle of Bloody Gulch (Hill 30).

      Hartsock's squad consists of the remains of the original 2nd Squad (Cpl. Franklin Paddock, Pvt. Dean "Friar"
      Winchell, and Pfc. James Marsh) and the remnants of 1st Squad (Cpl. Jacob Campbell, Pvt. Will Paige, and Pvt.
      Derrick McConnell). In addition, the player will also be in command of Corporal (later promoted to Sergeant)
      Seamus Doyle of the 82nd Airborne during the initial D-Day invasion in early parts of the game.</story>

    <story>Brunswick Pro Bowling is a bowling simulation game. In Career mode, after creating an avatar, players compete
      against the computer to work their way up from amateur to professional. The player character will increase in
      skill (e.g. strength, accuracy) and earn money while playing. This money can be used to buy clothing or a new
      bowling ball, which also affects skill. Quick Play mode, as the name suggests, allows for a quick round of bowling
      for one to four players.

      Making a throw is a little bit different depending on the platform the game is played on. Lining up on the alley
      to decide the direction of the ball stays the same, but on PlayStation 2 and PSP it's also necessary to set its
      spin. The next step is rolling the ball. On the Wii this is done by swinging the Wiimote and releasing the trigger
      button, where the speed of the release determines the spin of the ball. In the other versions a sickle-shaped
      meter is shown; pulling down on the analog stick sets the accuracy, and pushing it forward the strength of the
      release.</story>

      One notable feature of Burnout is the "Burn Meter." The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing

    <story>Buzz! The Schools Quiz is the sixth game in the Buzz! series, and like all other Buzz! titles it must be
      played using the USB ?Buzz! Buzzers? controllers, instead of the regular controllers. The game is sold both with
      and without these Buzz! Buzzers and there are four buzzers per set. This means that using the PS2?s two USB
      connections, up to eight players can play at once.
      The game was developed in partnership with the Department for Education and Skills and expert educational
      consultancy Schoolzone for use in both classrooms and at home. As with all Buzz! Games, it?s set in a game show
      environment. Players answer questions on different subjects taken from the Key Stage 2 National Curriculum, aimed
      at children from age?s seven to eleven.
      There are several game play modes available, allowing players to play on just one subject or from a wide range.
      Team and single player modes are also available to allow different numbers of players to play at once. A Teacher
      feature gives the teacher control over how the game is played, allowing them to pause and involve children in the
      answers being given.</story>

      even dog sledding are supreme.
      There are two game modes that can be played. In each of the game modes, create a hunter and choose from three
      difficulty settings. Open Season mode will allow you to quickly hunt or fish in any unlocked area. Adventure mode
      is the main mode of the game and is the true Alaskan experience. In this mode, travel to each region and visit the
      outposts to acquire the proper gear including clothing and tents. You will be able to go on hunts, fishing
      challenges and special contests. Try to unlock new regions, new gear and try to win trophies for prize catches.
      When hunting, choose from an array of firearms including rifles, shotguns, muzzleloaders, handguns and bows. Grab
      a pair of binoculars to scan out the area or use a scope for more accurate aiming . Game calls, decoys, scents and
      lures will also help aid in your hunting experience. Big game animals range from Kodiak Bears and Musk Ox to
      Barren Ground Caribou and Mountain Goats. Also available to hunt are small game animals such as coyotes, beavers
      and even birds.
      Fishing will take you all over Alaska trying to catch Salmon, Arctic Graylings and other Alaskan species. Use the
      correct bait and lures in the proper areas to make the catch. You can choose from ice fishing, spin fishing and
      fly fishing with a number of rods and reels to choose from.</story>

    <story>Another in the Big Game Hunting series, 2005 Adventures brings you 36 big game animals in 10 locations.
      Choose from many guns, bows, equipment, and clothing before heading out to take on these animals.

      Head out looking for whatever animal(s) you have tags for. Track your target through mountains, plains, hills,
      streams, and lakes. Swim across lakes and streams that are in your way and drive various vehicles to save time
      getting where you're going. Once you find your prey, get close enough to shoot without your target noticing you.
      Then take the shot!

      Play the game in quick hunt or career mode, or play with friends online. Go to your cabin to see the animals you
      have shot in career mode... you can even choose your what cabin you want out of six choices!

      Unlike many other hunting games that have you go out and kill what you can in a single day, you can take as many
      days as you need to bag your limit. Use tents to sleep away the nights, or walk around looking for possible spots
      to sit and wait for prey on the following day... just don't forget to eat and drink to keep up your energy.

      Play through rain and snow as well as clear weather conditions. Animals behave differently in different
      conditions, just like in real life.</story>

    <story>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2009 puts the player in the shoes of Flint Abrahams, a famous hunter who travels
      around the world in search of hunting challenges. The player spends much time exploring the wilderness looking for
      traces of prey. Because they can be hard to make out, a Hunter's Sense is included to reduce the world to
      grayscales and make animals stand out. The game however maintains an arcade approach and lets the player shoot
      everything in his way, without regard for a patient approach.

      The game's Career mode has timed levels forcing quick gameplay, and the different stages are set all around the
      world. When facing larger animals such as bear or lions, a Hand-to-Claw Combat mode is often triggered
      automatically to fend them off through a number of quick time event key presses. Another option is the Adrenaline
      mode where time comes almost completely to a stop, making it easier to line up the shots and get a lot of kills.

      Different types of equipment become available to assist in the hunt, and in certain missions it is not required to
      kill animals ? tranquillizing them is sufficient.</story>

    <story>After winning 2003 PC "Game of the Year" awards from a number of magazines and online publications, the World
      War II-themed first-person shooter Call of Duty seeks its Finest Hour in this 2004 console version. As in the home
      computer original, PlayStation 2 players experience the game through three different campaigns, which have them
      taking the roles of an American, British, and Russian soldier in turn.
      Each campaign is designed to offer a distinct perspective, as the player's characters and their squad mates
      participate in historically inspired battles across four different continents. The Call of Duty series is noted
      for its historical accuracy and cross-cultural perspectives, its interactive environments, and its cinematically
      styled approach to story-telling. The PC original was developed by Infinity Ward, a team comprising several
      designers who had worked on the successful Medal of Honor series. The Finest Hour console versions of Call of Duty
      are the first games from developer Spark Unlimited.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>A collection of minigames based loosely around the story of the film with the farmyard serving as a central
      hub that the player returns to after each minigame.

      In total there are 19 minigames, in which the player is given control of 1 of the 3 main characters from the film.
      In the farmyard area, the player controls Wilbur the Pig, where he must find various items throughout the farm
      whilst keeping out of sight of the farmer and his sheepdog.
      Once a task has been completed on the farmyard, the game then moves to a minigame based loosely on the events of
      the film.
      You can control Wilbur in a runaway pram rolling down a hill and must keep the pram balanced until it comes to
      rest.
      Some of the games let the player control Templeton the Rat. In one minigame he must hurl rubbish at incoming birds
      in a rubbish dump using a catapult hastily built from the materials lying nearby. In another he must outpace a
      runaway egg in some tunnels under the dirt.
      The last playable character is Charlotte herself. These games generally involve the barn as a backdrop (in a 2D
      setting) with the goal of travelling from one side to the other by swinging from webs and dodging obstacles and
      catching flies.</story>

    <story>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares
      arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. It is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people
      worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.
      Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight
      pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces,
      with the objective to 'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. In
      addition to checkmate, the game can be won by the voluntary resignation of the opponent, which typically occurs
      when too much material is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable. A game may also result in a draw in several
      ways, where neither player wins. The course of the game is divided into three phases: opening, middlegame, and
      endgame.</story>

      Depending on which level you're playing, you'll be able to play as at least two of the four children, although
      some levels require you to use all four. The four children all have different special abilities. Peter is the
      strongest of the bunch, so you can use him for fighting off enemies or breaking through barriers. Susan is a raged
      fighter and she can throw arrows, tennis balls and snowballs. Edmund is a decent melee fighter who can climb trees
      and walk on ice without breaking it. Lucy has the ability to heal the other children, go through small spaces and
      stand on big snowballs and make them roll. During each level you can switch between characters at any time.

      Scattered throughout the levels are coins, pink and green gems, and hidden shields that will give ratings at the
      end of the levels, ranging from fair to outstanding.</story>

      popularly played as a gambling game. In the game, each player is dealt either thirteen or sixteen tiles in a hand,
      depending on the variation being played. On their turn, players draw a tile and discard one, with the goal of
      making four or five melds (also depending on the variation) and one pair, or "head". Winning comes "on the draw"
      by drawing a new or discarded tile that completes the hand. Thus, a winning hand actually contains fourteen (or

      You'll be in control of both the driver and your partner, the warrior, whose job is to attack the other racers to
      make them fall over. Chariots are controlled by whipping horses and trying to balance an on-screen meter that
      keeps your chariot balanced while taking turns fast.

      There are four different race modes available; Training, which gives you the basics on how to play, Arcade, which
      is your standard race, Multiplayer, which lets you face off against three friends (or foes), and Career, which
      tracks your progress over a period of time.

      There are seven different environments and 19 tracks, all set throughout the Roman Empire.

      Each course is littered with obstacles, power ups, weapons, and special moves, designed to give you an edge in

    <story>Clannad is a Japanese visual novel developed by Key and released on April 28, 2004 for Windows PCs. While
      both of Key's first two previous works, Kanon and Air, had been released first as adult games and then censored
      for the younger market, Clannad was released with a rating for all ages. It was later ported to the PlayStation 2,
      PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 consoles. The story follows the life of Tomoya Okazaki, a high
      school delinquent who meets many people in his last year at school, including five girls, and helps resolve their
      individual problems.
      The gameplay of Clannad follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of
      interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. The game was
      ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50
      several more times afterwards. Key went on to produce an adult spin-off titled Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life
      in November 2005, which expanded on the scenario of Tomoyo Sakagami, one of the five heroines from Clannad.

      P6, Triumph TR5, Triumph TR6 and a secret car to be unlocked after qualifying with the 12 first cars.

      The game features three gameplay modes: Single Race, Time Trials and Challenge. In order to play the Single Race
      and Challenge modes, the player has to unlock cars racing one lap in any circuit in the Time Trials mode, within
      the time limit. Once the cars are unlocked, they'll be available in the other two play modes, with three different
      painting options.

      The Single Race mode, as the name implies, lets the player chose any of the unlocked cars and race against 7 other
      competitors in any course of choice. There are 6 circuits available: Scottish Highlands, Rooksley Forest,
      Greenwood County, Foxglove Lane, Westminster Run and London City Centre.

      In the Challenge mode, three cups are available: Bronze, Silver and Gold, each one comprising 4 circuits. Each cup
      won unlocks the next.

      The game can be played using the keyboard or a gamepad. The controls consist in buttons for steering,
      accelerating, breaking and hand breaking. Three camera angles are available: from behind the car (3rd person
      view), from the hood and from the car's front (first person views). A "review mirror" camera is also available.

      team, recruiting and training potential NBA players for the future. It sports updated offensive and defensive A.I.
      and features Team Unity where the chemistry of the team combined with the captain's leadership qualities can
      combine to help their team in their performance and morale on the court.

      Players can also customize by creating their own school along with uniforms and even design a unique stadium for

      has the ability to create their own chants for their crowds to yell during home games and the PS3 utilizes the

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>Combat?Elite: WWII Paratroopers is primarily a top-down close-combat shooter with some RPG features. It can
      be played in single-player or two-player coop mode. The game lets the player take part as a paratrooper in the
      allied campaign in Europe during the second world war, starting out as a private soldier from either the US 101st
      Airborne, the US 82nd Airborne, or the British 1st Airborne regiment.

      There are 40 missions strung together with a narrative, depicting the Operation Overlord (D-Day), Bastogne,
      Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge and beyond - ending in an fictional effort to stop the Nazis
      from creating an atomic bomb. During a mission, you find medical packs, ammunition (weapon specific), and new
      weapons as pickups lying around, or dropped by enemies killed - the drops disappear if not picked up in time. A
      mission takes place on a series of relatively small maps, separated into 'levels', and at the level transition
      points the player can save the game, and is also awarded skill points, new ranks and medals.</story>

      Rather than gung-ho desert tank warfare, or tense jungle ambush fighting, the game explores many non-army
      locations such as gas factories, cocaine production facilities and hotels.

      The combat is often up close and very personal, although most levels seem to mix up the killzone areas giving a
      wide variety that support combat over many varying ranges. The Missions vary quite a bit too. Some are frenetic -
      fast paced where the team are fighting for their lives, others can be played at a much slower pace if desired. The
      level design really adds to counter-terrorism gameplay. The Team are often busting seiges using C4 to blow holes

    <story>John Constantine is the name of the main character in the Hellblazer comic by Vertigo DC. This game is based
      on the movie Constantine, starring Keanu Reeves. The player assumes the role of Constantine, a
      mage/exorcist/demonslayer of the modern age. A man who fights Evil, but remains cynical and skeptical in the face
      of Good. He also smokes a lot.

      The game is played in third person perspective, switching to first person when the hero enters narrow spaces.
      Constantine's goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient
      laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch's Curse)
      that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize
      various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell,
      which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level
      is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or
      stretched out to allow for more action. Hidden cards in levels will unlock cutscene animatics, concept art, and
      interviews with the stars of the film.</story>

    <story>Crash: Mind over Mutant continues the storyline of its predecessor, Crash of the Titans.

      The Titans from the previous game has broken free from Dr. Cortex' control and has settled down on various places
      on the Wumpa Islands. But Cortex has teamed up with Nitrus Brio to develop a device which can control both the
      bandicoots and the Titans. Now Crash and his friends must find out where Cortex is hiding and stop him before he
      can act out his devious plan.

      Crash can use a light-powered attack to defeat smaller enemies, but for bigger enemies, a more high-powered attack
      is needed. Crash can also block and dodge attacks. Just like in Crash of the Titans, Crash can take control of the
      Titans which he encounters. But this time he can take the Titans with him and use them when he needs it. As Crash
      defeats more and more enemies, he can upgrade both his own attacks and the attacks of the Titans in his
      possession.

      The Co-Op Experience:

    <story>Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original
      PlayStation. The story is set some time after Warped: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash
      (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way.
      So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex).

      The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is
      trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound
      is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a
      puzzle is not really possible.</story>

    <story>Crashed is an action racing game, similar to the Destruction Derby games. Dispensing with any pretence of
      simulation, the game aims for arcade gameplay. The bright colours in the art style and easy way the cars can be
      turned with just a press of the handbrake all signal that this is not a game to be taken seriously.

      Although cosmetically the damage is locational, the cars do not suffer unduly if the damage is taken all in one
      area. Unlike the Destruction Derby games, you can continue to use your front to ram opponents throughout a match.
      Rather than have the cars race laps, matches more often take place in open arenas of sand, ice, grass, mud and
      tarmac.

      Multiplayer comes with different game modes. Traditional Last Man Standing is supplemented with multiple
      variations. A Hunter game-type, where one car is designated a target and points can only be scored by hitting it.
      There is also a score target which encourages going for the big points hits and stunts, rather than destroying
      competitors. Others are defensive and offensive driving challenges and a game type where only points scored by
      performing jumps and stunts are counted. Multiplayer is supported through 4-player split-screen, but no through
      Xbox Live play or the system link.</story>

    <story>Crusty Demons is an extreme sports game based on the real-life stunt troupe of the same name. Motorized
      vehicles such as motorcycles and cars are used in performing tricks on ramps, half-pipes and over open areas.
      Large environments such as trailer parks and international cities like New York and Tokyo are available for the
      player to explore, do tricks and race.

      The story of the videogame has the Crusty Demons meeting the Devil and agreeing to sign over their souls if given
      immortality. However, the Crusty Demons want to renege on the deal once they find out that they can still feel
      pain when fatally injured. The Devil, not without mercy, agree to offer back their souls on the condition that the
      Crusty Demons follow his every order and fulfill his demands for whatever stunt he asks of them.

      Whenever a stunt goes fatally wrong, the games rag doll engine rewards the player with a graphic simulation of the
      collision or bail. This is also conjoined with the appropriate blood splatter on the screen as well as x-rays that
      show whichever bones have broken. Unlockables consist of pictures of "babes".</story>

    <story>By 2078, earth's natural resources have been depleted. Massive CO2 emissions have occurred and there are no
      longer fossil fuel reserves. Because of global warming, the rise of the ocean level has made many countries
      disappear. Fortunately, extreme weather patterns have emerged and wind has become an endless resource with
      enormous speeds. Mankind has adapted and now uses the powerful wind as a source for transportation, constructing
      vehicles to make use of it. Additionally, The International Racing League is organized, a racing event where speed
      is determined by the control of wind. This is where you come in.

      Cyclone Circus is a racer where you can compete against 9 computer players or against another player in dual
      screen mode. The cars sport an exotic and futuristic design, and each car has a plasma sail that you have to use
      as good as you can. Turning the wind to your advantage, you can pick up numerous bonuses and even power-ups that
      will catapult you ahead of your opponents. Each level has a very specific setting and atmosphere, and contains a
      number of special jump sites and bonus areas where you can do special tricks to score more points.

      There are ten characters, nine courses with shortcuts, and eight trick levels based on ramps and fly routes.

    <story>Dai-2-ji Super Robot Taisen ? is the third game in the Alpha sub-series after Super Robot Taisen ? Gaiden,
      picking up a few months after the previous story. Earth has successfully repelled the Neo Zeon and Zentradi
      attacks, but faces ever more new threats, from both inside and out.

      Gameplay is the standard mission-based, turn-based strategy that the series is well-known for. Several new systems
      appear, including a new Platoon system that allows groups of units to work in unison, a damage scaling system
      where the size of units affects the damage they take from attacks, and the redesigned pilot training system
      introduced in Original Generation. New series featured in this entry include Brain Powered, Crossbone Gundam,
      GaoGaiGar, and Steel Jeeg.</story>

      watching themselves on TV. Keeping players on the dance mat is more than 100 minutes of energetic dance music,
      including exclusively-licensed dance hits as well as smash-hit songs, such as "Genie In A Bottle" and "Oops!...I

    <story>Slightly varied in technology and musical content from the Japanese arcade game and home port of the same
      name as well as the parallel European release Dancing Stage SuperNova 2, this game delivers rhythmic play that has
      become well-established over the course of the series' dynasty -- to gloss generally, players are rated on how
      effectively they deliver input in response to a continuously-scrolling list of controller direction instructions.
      When the screen tells players that they're about to be called upon to hit the "left" button as its corresponding
      glyph ascends up the screen, they must try to match it precisely at the moment of the glyph's overlap with a
      target area at the top of the screen. DDR games being what they are, this is all synchronized to player-selected
      electro-pop music with music video or animated dancing avatar sideshows, and of course is intended for play with
      the series' trademark control device, a giant four-way directional pad laid on the floor to be rhythmically walked
      upon. (Two can be used simultaneously for two players or one who boasts some simply spectacular dance moves.)

    <story>Promising over 100 hours of gameplay, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse is one of the longest adventures on the
      PlayStation 2. Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was
      defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his
      resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she
      must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An
      action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a
      wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect.

      Weapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The
      requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold.
      Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal.
      Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent,
      with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are
      free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's
      abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to
      face the Shadow Lord.</story>

      The game's most remarkable feature is the ability to allow Nina to use her martial arts skills to break the bones

      player the damage being inflicted on the opponent's skeletal structure. Strangely, this does little to actually
      disable opponents, as they often continue to use limbs that have been literally shattered, as well as survive
      blows to the head that would cause the skull to practically explode, without even losing consciousness.

      Once the game is completed, "Anna Mode" will be unlocked, offering the player the ability to play as Nina's
      younger sibling, Anna. Various outfits can be unlocked throughout the game, which include a bikini, cocktail
      dress, purple jumpsuit, black and silver stealth suit. Playing the game a second time causes LCD crates throughout

    <story>Def Jam: Fight for NY is the sequel to the out-of-left-field Def Jam: Vendetta.

      The game opens with the person you beat in the previous game, D-Mobb, being arrested. As the police are driving,
      an SUV comes out of nowhere and smashes into the car, setting D-Mobb free. After a quick cutscene, it turns out
      the person who was driving the SUV was you, and you have now joined D-Mobb's crew.

      Fight for NY's story mode takes you through the ranks, and pits you against tougher and tougher fighters. You
      start off in D-Mobb's crew as a nobody, and will have to work your way up, fighting off people from other crews,
      including D-Mobb's rival, Crow. You'll take part mostly in one-on-one brawls, with the odd team match and free for
      all thrown in.</story>

      "Black Hawk Down". First half of the game consists of varied missions that Delta Force soldiers had to engage
      into, like defending UN food convoys, rescuing hostages or destroying weapon shipments.

      Second half of the game covers the events of the mission Irene on October 3rd, 1993. It's goal was to capture two
      lieutenants of the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid and was expected to last less than 30 minutes, but after
      two Black Hawk helicopters were shoot down, it took US soldiers more than 16 hours to return to safety. 18 US
      soldiers, 1 Malaysian and hundreds of Somalis were killed. A 19th SFC. Matt Rierson died two days later in an
      mortar attack.

      On most missions the player works as a member of a small Delta Force team, working in co-operation with US Army

    <story>Devil Kings is in the same vein as the Dynasty Warriors series. Whereas in Dynasty Warriors, however, Koei
      focuses on ancient Chinese history, Devil Kings focuses more on feudal Japan, but with a fictional setting with
      the ability to use modern day weapons such as chain guns and shotguns as well as fighting legendary and fictional
      characters from the past.

      The story takes place as the Devil King, a king possessed by the soul of the Devil, has unleashed an unholy army
      on the world to bend it to his will as the player must stop him along with many of his minions including his wife
      Lady Butterfly, his general the Red Minotaur, as well as loyal assassins Scorpio and Venus.

      The gameplay is more arcade hack-and-slash style, with the ability of using magic spells to wipe out entire waves
      of enemies and as mentioned before, the ability to use modern day weapons along with historical weapons such as
      spears, swords among others. There are six playable characters to use as well, each with their own story told in
      CG and anime cutscenes as well as two modes of play, Conquest (the main story of the game) and Free Mode (where
      players can play in any unlocked stage they have completed).</story>

      You are in John's shoes as he must face a new threat. Piet Gruber, the son of Hans Gruber and McClane's old enemy,
      is up to no good at the Townsend Art Museum. He has stolen valuable art and kidnapped John's now adult daughter
      and fellow CCPD police officer, Lucy.

      This game is a First Person Shooter, but it also adds two features: Stealth Mode and Hero Time. Stealth Mode
      allows John to sneak around quietly, even being able to grab his foes and use them as hostages. This means it may
      not be best to go in guns blazing, when they could be arrested. Hero Time allows John to react far more quickly,
      just like Bullet Time in Max Payne. Hero Time is earned by saving hostages and performing heroic tasks in the
      game.

      There are several different weapons available in the game, ranging from a paintball gun for training to a sniper
      rifle. Most of the guns can also be used dual for the ultimate killing spree.</story>

    <story>Set after the events of Final Fantasy VII and the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children movie, Dirge of Cerberus
      lets players take the role of the mysterious Vincent Valentine.

      After a new organization arises from the events known as "Meteorfall", Vincent is called to the surviving town of
      Kalm by Reeve Tuesti, an old ally who controlled Cait Sith. Vincent has been invited to the town's celebration,
      but during the festivities, a group of soldiers attacks the town, killing and capturing the people. It is up to
      Vincent to protect the innocent once more, and find out why these soldiers are also after him.

      While set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerberus is an action shooter that runs through twelve
      chapters. The on-screen action can be controlled by the analog controller, or via the Playstation 2's mouse and
      keyboard accessories, making it more in line with PC-style shooters. Being a character driven shooter, the
      perspective can be changed from first to third person on the fly to navigate through the multi-level environments.

      Several items and characters from the series make their return, as well as the Chaos break limits system, which
      allows Vincent to take the monstrous forms he changed into from Final Fantasy VII to inflict more damage on the
      enemy. Taking a nod from its RPG-based parent, the game does allow Vincent to find the usual healing items,
      materia spells and gil from the Final Fantasy universe, in which he can buy and sell for other new items.

      The game also features a weapon customization system, which allows the player to mix and match weapon parts to

      bridge, crawls over a pile of rumble, or climbs a narrow path between ruined houses, the Earth can start
      trembling...

      Disaster Report is a combination of pure adventure and survival horror genres. Controls, inventory management,
      fixed camera angles and relative vulnerability of the protagonist are reminiscent of Alone in the Dark and similar
      games, while the complete lack of enemies to fight reminds of a classic adventure. There are many ways to preserve
      Keith from constant dying. You can find items and combine them into new ones (for example, finding a helmet and a
      lamp will allow you to build a helmet with a flashlight attached to it). Keith will also need to quench his

      king, Laharl joins with his subordinate Etna and her underlings to fight back.

      Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The
      player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do
      combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal
      damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the
      player's units are destroyed.

      Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or
      force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the
      base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy
      in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters
      inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</story>

      The game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining
      character levels, and can level up those abilities through use. New items and equipment can be bought or won in
      battle, and can be powered up up by entering and winning battles inside a given item. Characters can also "gang
      up" on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking
      character. This action only uses the attacking character's turn, leaving the others free to attack again. Clever
      coordination can have characters attacking quite a few times per turn. New characters can be created (or even
      reborn as other classes or just more powerful versions of the same class) by petitioning (or even bribing with
      special items) the Dark Assembly with "Mana" you earn by defeating enemies.</story>

      lesser ghosts throughout the rooms. Though Zeke handles his quest alone, he is aided by the help of Madame Leota,
      and six friendly ghosts who will provide hints and items throughout the journey. As Zeke solves puzzles, completes
      various tasks, and helps rid the house of its evil spirits, these spiritual companions will provide Soul Gems,
      which amplify the power of the Soul Beacon. Once fully charged, Zeke will have the ability to face the main
      spirit, Atticus Thorn, for the final showdown.</story>

    <story>Treasure Planet is the adaptation of an animated Disney movie. The game follows the adventures of Jim
      Hawkins, a young boy on a quest to locate a mythical planet called Treasure Planet. To find the planet he needs to
      travel to many locations throughout the universe and complete tasks before he finds the ultimate prize. The tasks
      range from finding a certain number of items to catching runaway animals to flipping a series of switches.
      Completing the tasks lights a beacon, and when a set number of these beacons are lit, the next level is then
      available.

      Jim is also able to ask for help from his "pet," Morph, to get him past areas that pose a challenge. Morph can
      change his shape into a helpful item like giant robotic arms or a jetpack.

      Another adaptation from the movie is solar surfing. During the surfing missions Jim pilots a futuristic surfboard
      to complete the mission objectives.</story>

      returned to reprise their characters in the game with the exception of Tom Hanks (Woody) and Tim Allen (Buzz
      Lightyear), respectively. (Jim Hanks returned to voice Woody from the previous game, and Stephen Stanton voiced
      Buzz). The game also contains content exclusive to the PlayStation 3 version. The game was well received by
      critics and was a top-seller in the UK. This was the last Disney/Pixar video game to be developed by Asobo Studio
      and the last Disney/Pixar game to be released on PlayStation 2.

      His name was Fame Douglas, and he was renowned as the sponsor of the legendary Dead or Alive World Combat
      Championship. Since his death, and in the absence of his charisma and leadership, the world has become chaotic.

    <story>Dodgeball is a team dodgeball game. First team to get the other team out is the winner, be it through the
      one-shot system or a "life system" where the object is to lower the opposition's players health to zero. If both
      teams are still in by the end of the game, the team with the most players wins the game. If teams have an equal
      amount of players left then the team with the least damage taken wins. If equal damage has been taken by either
      team then the game ends in a tie.

      Play as one of six teams who each represent a certain country, spearheaded by a figure from history or national
      folklore - Japan (Nobunaga), Germany (Bach), Greece (Pythagoras), Norway (King Harald I), Great Britain (King
      Arthur) and the United States of America (Wyatt Earp). There are three other teams to unlock as the game
      progresses.

      in a Team Battle, or team up with up to three friends for a Multi-Player Battle against the computer.</story>

      be learnt, and used to win treats from humans.

      Jake must explore vast environments and interact with 15 breeds of dog. The aim is to get them onto his side,
      which is usually done by either having more bones than them, or winning a subgame against them. These are also
      dog-based - in one you must dig up bones, while another has you 'marking territory' to annex a full screen.

    <story>In Dokapon Kingdom monsters have attacked and pillaged the kingdom of its riches. For the adventurer who
      returns the kingdom's wealth, his majesty offers the honor of his daughter's hand, and therefore the title of
      future king. This doesn't mean, however, that you aren't permitted to play as a female character. You simply
      receive an altered ending in this instance.

      Three different modes are available: Story Mode, Normal Mode, and Shopping Race. You then create your character
      and begin play, the mode you choose having an affect on the overall goal to be achieved. The Story Mode is the
      standard play through of the plot, Normal Mode lets you generate certain factors of play ahead of time, like
      starting level, and go from there, etc. There are 3 started classes (warrior, chief and magician) and through
      levelling eventually 11 become available.

      While having a board game scenario with a spinner that allows the player to move over a game board, this is very
      much a light role-playing game as it has basic jobs, a battle system, and upgrades. Landing on a spot can trigger
      a battle, advance the story or introduce a mini-game. It is a 2-player game at all times (with another character
      controlled by the computer), but up to 4 people can participate.</story>

    <story>The second release in a series of three, .hack//G.U.: Vol. 2 -- Reminisce takes place in a fictional MMO
      environment called The World. As in previous releases of .hack, The World features elements of online gaming
      without the actual connection. Gamers interact with people they might find in a real MMO, take on quests, and
      adventure across a large environment as they increase their level.

      In this version of The World, gamers find the once-utopian landscape is now a player killer's (PKers) heaven. A
      bug in the game is blocking the log-off ability to all fictional gamers; effectively locking them into The World.
      Now, bands of PKers prey on every character in their path hoping that the slaughter knocks them out of the game
      and back into real life.

      Gamers take the role of Haseo, a killer of players who is stuck in the game. Haseo must work his way through The
      World by interacting with other character, defeating enemies in dungeon sprawls, and by completing assigned
      objectives. Navigation through the game requires the use of Warp points located around the map.</story>

      entity terrorizing players in "The World" is free and wreaking havoc in real-life. Players once again take the
      role of Haseo, a young adventurer who is the only hope for restoring peace in "The World."

      Gamers lead Haseo through many recognizable environments and into such new root towns as Breg Epona and the Net
      Slum. The steam bike makes a return and players can now upgrade their bikes and speed through five riding
      missions. Toward the end of the game, players may access a 100 floor dungeon and work through each level with
      their most powerful party members.

      Haseo has earned a few upgrades via a mysterious hacker who broke into his account and added a new set of powers.
      These powers, called the "Xth" form, allow Haseo to use a pair of pistols with blades on the barrel. With these
      weapons Haseo can deal greater damage and perform a "double trigger" attack by invoking a special ability.

      The level cap is increased to 150, and gamers can add up to 22 additional avatars to their party. In the heat of
      battle, if players find themselves at the losing end, they can access the "avatar awakening" power and drain the
      virus cores from the enemy. Additionally, there are new cards for the "Crimson Versus" game and a new arena
      battle.</story>

      The main Story mode allows players to battle through crucial moments from theDragon Ball Z Saiyan, Namekian, and
      Andriod sagas, through to the Cell Games, learning new skills and upgrading their characters along the way. Other
      modes allow players to enter customized battles with their improved characters, to edit their characters' acquired
      skills, and to go head-to-head against other human-controlled fighters.
      The game features seven different modes of play in all (one for each Dragon Ball), but some of the later modes
      must be unlocked.</story>

    <story>Drakengard follows the story of a kingdomless prince named Caim who fights for the Union against the Empire.
      Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human
      manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is
      fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes
      a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will
      forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged
      with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...

      The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground
      combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing
      fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade
      incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though
      usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the
      battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual
      enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies.
      Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control
      is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the
      air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event
      combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of
      a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.

      Levels that have been visited before might become "Expedition Missions" which are optional and contain new
      objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at
      any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to
      Drakengard.</story>

      mix between fish and human, has to survive levels which are similar to most licensed games from animated movies: a
      3rd person platformer.

      The sections with B.o.B., a slime monster, are more puzzle oriented. He can swallow enemies or items and use them
      to spit on other enemies. These are also used to press switches and as safety procedure when crossing bars - if
      B.o.B. had nothing solid in him he would just slip through them. With B.o.B. the player also has to solve mazes
      and shooting sequences. The last character is Gigantika, a 15 meters high woman. She uses trucks as inline skates
      and has to avoid obstacles by jumping or mastering quick time events (pressing a displayed button in a limited
      time).

      In co-op mode the second player takes the role of a Dr. Cockroach and supports the main player with appropriate
      actions, e.g. shooting. The player can unlock a lot of bonus material, e.g. concept art, deleted scenes (in this

    <story>Mashed is an action-packed top-down arcade-racer. On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player
      first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four
      different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones).

      The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold
      challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven
      (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles
      where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really
      like you.

      To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can
      pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers
      out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to
      make sure they can't use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is
      just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very

    <story>Driver: Parallel Lines is the fourth game in the Driver series, following the story of TK. In 1978, TK (who
      was then an 18-year-old driver-for-hire who had just graduated from high school) was sentenced to 28 years in
      prison for a crime he did not commit, and is released from prison in 2006. Now, with his driving skills, he seeks
      revenge against the police department for having to serve time for something someone else should've gone to prison
      for!

      Unlike Driv3r, Driver: Parallel Lines mostly takes place behind the wheel, returning back to the formula that made
      the first game a classic. The game still has a GTA-style open-ended design, though, and you can still exit your
      vehicle for some on-foot action. However, there's no reason to exit your vehicle unless it's damaged and you can
      no longer drive it, as almost all of the game's missions involve cop car chases. If that's the case, then you can
      either go to the repair shop to repair your vehicle, or just steal someone else's vehicle! Until then, you can
      punch the cops with your fists and steal their weapons when they're dead, so that you can use them for future

      nations of the world decided to form the UPF, "United Peace Force", replacing the UN and NATO. It is an
      anti-terror army, operating world-wide.

      But there is another globally operating group: A massively militarised drug syndicate. When an attack on a peace
      convoy in Columbia is linked to this cartel, the UPF starts investigation. A central base and training camp of the
      drug cartel is believed to be located somewhere in Libya. The UPF opens up a base in this country and starts
      looking for the criminals.

      The player is a recently recruited soldier and pilot of the UPF. During the campaign, which lasts for 20 rather
      long missions, he can travel and fight on foot, in tanks and various other ground vehicles, but most of the time

      country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared
      the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like
      blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.
      They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.
      Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first
      flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong.
      Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way.
      Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide

    <story>Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends is a stand-alone expansion to Dynasty Warriors 3. In both games, you take
      control of a military general in ancient China, each with their own unique abilities and weapons.

      The gameplay is simple: you destroy hoards of differently ranked enemies on an open battlefield. Your objective in
      most missions is to defeat one or more enemy generals. Each character you choose has a different storyline (this
      story mode is referred to as "Musou Mode"), with seven battles progressing the story along. Battles get harder as
      you move along in the story. There is also a free mode, which allows you to play any level that you have unlocked
      with any general that you have unlocked (you start the game with three generals from three different dynasties).

      The difference between Xtreme Legends and the original Dynasty Warriors 3 is that in Xtreme Legends, the Musou
      Mode only features seven unaligned generals that you couldn't play as in the original. There are also challenge
      modes in Xtreme Legends not featured in the original. And there is a more advanced bodyguard system allowing you
      to name them, customize their advancement, and choose from more weapons you unlock as you play through the game.

      spend on various different actions. You can create items and tactics for your generals to use in battle. Recruit
      generals and troops, fortify your territories, among many other command options. You can wage war on other

      will fight. There are 4 scenarios to unlock, though they offer little to differentiate each other.

    <story>Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends is a minor expansion to Dynasty Warriors 5. This game was released on
      November 16, 2005 and is playable only on the PlayStation 2 video game console.

      Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends does not allow the player to play Musou Mode or Free Mode if the player does
      not possess the original Dynasty Warriors 5 game disk. New game modes included Destiny Mode, Xtreme Mode, and
      Legend Mode.

      Xtreme Mode is a parallel to Shura Mode in Dynasty Warriors 5 Special, in which the objective of the game is for
      the human-controlled character to survive as long as possible while collecting gold dropped by enemies to regain
      health and increase stats temporarily.

      In Destiny Mode, the player is first allowed to customize a character. After creating a personalized character, a
      player will be asked to join the Kingdom of Shu, Wei and Wu. While in this mode, you will be playing as a
      character with very few attacks (starting off with only 2 fundamental hits) and will be "protected" by a chosen
      officer near the character. The officer will heal the character continuously when injured during battle, so long
      as the character is nearby. A unique feature of Destiny Mode is that at times the player is given the option to
      betray one force, while setting a ruse for another. For example, a player receives a letter from Cao Cao, the King
      of Wei, in which he asks the player to defect from the Kingdom of Wu to the Kingdom of Wei. If the player defers
      the offer to switch sides their commander may approach them in the hopes of creating a ruse to destroy the
      opposing force. If the player chooses to accept the option from their commander they will fight for the other side
      temporarily. When the time is right their original commander will have them move the opposing commander to a set
      position which will trigger their ruse and supporting units will ambush the opposing commander to support the
      player's defection.</story>

    <story>Veteran publisher Koei draws more inspiration from Chinese literature's Romance of the Three Kingdoms for its
      sixth installment of Dynasty Warriors. As with previous titles in the action-oriented series, players choose from
      a variety of stout heroes and noble warriors before engaging in historically inspired battles featuring hundreds
      of combatants. While the series has been criticized for its lack of significant changes from release to release,
      Dynasty Warriors 6 adds a number of enhancements to the well-traveled franchise. Though it lacks the graphical
      flourishes of the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS2 edition of Dynasty Warriors 6 offers ten new scenarios, five
      additional stages, and host of new weapons. The emphasis is still on defeating throngs of enemies with swords,
      giant hammers, polearms, and other weapons, with lengthy combo chains possible by varying attacks.

      As players become more skilled in combat, they can choose from a variety of skills to customize their heroes as
      they see fit. A new "renbu" system allows characters to earn immediate combat bonuses through dexterous play, but
      these bonuses are lost once the battle is over. Characters also have the ability to swim across water and scale
      walls to perform surprise attacks on enemy camps. Another change is the omission of bodyguards, so players must go
      it alone instead of having a personal entourage. In their place is a faithful steed that can be called upon in a
      pinch to make hasty retreats or to charge at full gallop into groups. The character's horse will also level up
      along with characters, improving attributes in speed or power in combat. Featured game types include Musou Mode, a
      character-specific campaign, Challenge Mode, offering specific goals to complete, and Free, which involves
      building a character's stats on any unlocked battlefield. Players can also team-up with a friend via split-screen

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      him or knock attackers off platforms. Eragon can also manipulate his environment by creating pathways to
      previously unreachable areas. During the adventure, players may call for help from Saphira, Eragon's dragon, to
      complete airborne objectives and deliver attacks from the sky during melee combat on the ground. In flight,
      players direct the movement of the dragon, delivering tail swipes and fireballs to opponents as Saphira.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). In Japanese terminology, a distinction is
      often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist predominantly of narration and have very
      few interactive elements.
      Visual novels are distinguished from other game types by their extremely minimal gameplay. Typically the majority
      of player interaction is limited to clicking to keep the text, graphics and sound moving (most recent games offer
      "play" or "fast-forward" toggles that make even this unnecessary).</story>

    <story>Guybrush Threepwood has finally defeated the zombie pirate LeChuck, and married his sweetheart Elaine Marley.
      The happy couple is returning home from an exciting honeymoon. But as they arrive on Melee Island, they notice
      some very strange changes. A mysterious stranger who calls himself Charles L. Charles is organizing a campaign to
      become the next governor. The Australian businessman Ozzie Mandrill is turning the Caribbean into an attraction
      for tourists. And on top of that, Elaine's mansion is being demolished! Naturally, it's up to our hero to revert
      the things back to normal, even if that means traveling to exotic islands and solving puzzles on the way.

      Escape From Monkey Island is a direct sequel to The Curse of Monkey island, and is the fourth game in the Monkey
      Island series. The gameplay relies mainly on inventory-based puzzles and branching dialogues, just like in the
      previous installments. The interface is similar to that of Grim Fandango: mouse is not used, and the interaction
      is done via context-sensitive commands that appear on the screen whenever you navigate Guybrush close to an
      object. The game utilizes pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D character models.</story>

    <story>ESPN NFL 2K5 has a ton of new features for the new season.

      To start off, the ESPN presentation has been greatly expanded. Chris Berman, who did voiceover for the half-time
      show in 2K4, returns for this season. Instead of just voice, there is a virtual Chris Berman, who does an
      introduction to each game, a half-time report, and a post-game show. To illiustrate certain points, he uses
      replays from each game.
      One new feature is the V.I.P. system, which keeps track of how you play the game. If you pass 80% of the time, and
      run 20% of the time, your V.I.P. profile will reflect this. At a later time, you can play against your V.I.P., and
      the AI will play as if it were you.

      ESPN celebrates it's 25th anniversary this year, and as such, a special 25th Anniversary Mode has been added. This
      mode allows you to play moments from classic football games, including The Heidi Bowl and The Immaculate
      Reception.

      The Crib has an overhaul this year. Instead of earning specific items by completing tasks, you earn points, which
      you can use to buy items of your choice. New to the Crib is a dart board, as well as a phone, which you will use
      to answer calls from celebrities. You may get a call from Steve-O, Carmen Electra, Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette
      or Funkmaster Flex, challenging you to a game.

      Franchise mode also gets an overhaul. New to 2005 is the ability to schedule weekly preps for your team. You can
      choose to have players work out, play practice games, watch tapes, all in an effort to gear your team up for the

    <story>Based on Sam Raimi's classically campy series of horror films that began with 1983's The Evil Dead, this
      action game follows the continuing, cursed adventures of Ashley J. "Ash" Williams. Ash was recently sentenced to
      the Sunny Meadows Institute for the Criminally Insane, after being falsely convicted of murdering his camping
      companions. When Ash's psychiatrist begins tampering with the Necronomicon -- an evil book of ancient magic that
      has been the recurring source of Ash's supernatural troubles -- all hell breaks loose (quite literally).
      Once again, Ash is voiced by Bruce Campbell, who portrays the luckless hero in the films and previous Evil Dead
      games. Evil Dead: Regeneration plays like a combat adventure, in the fast-paced, fixed-camera style of the Devil
      May Cry or Onimusha games. Ash uses his "boomstick" shotgun and chainsaw prosthesis to blast and hack his way
      through nearly endless throngs of "deadites." Unlike earlier games based on the franchise, Evil Dead: Regeneration
      was developed by Cranky Pants Games, whose previous work includes the GameCube port of Volition's Red Faction II.

    <story>On December 24, 2005, Sergeant Dennis Riley, member of the special U.S. Marine Team Red Light receives a
      distress call from Fort Stewart, a top secret research facility in Antarctica. The signal requests an immediate
      air strike on the base. The team is sent to investigate the matter, but their plane crashes in the tundra. When
      Dennis arrives at the facility he finds out that something horrible has occurred, and must fight for his life as
      he encounters mutated creatures and is in danger of getting infected himself.

      Extermination is a survival horror game. The player character has limited ammunition for his firearms and in many
      cases it is advisable to run away from monsters. Besides the traditional health bar Dennis also has an Infection
      Rate, which may gradually grow when attacked by monsters. Once his Infection Rate reaches 100% he becomes very
      weak and would eventually mutate into a monster. Infection can be countered by applying MTS vaccines.

      The player character's default weapon, a special purpose rifle, can be customized with enhancements such as zoom
      scope, flashlight grip, radar, and parts which convert it to other weapon types such as flame thrower, shotgun, or
      rocket launcher. Dennis can also fight with a knife. Throughout the game batteries must be collected and used for
      activating various machines and saving the game.</story>

    <story>Extreme Sprint 3010 is a single-player, keyboard controlled, running jumping kind of a game. Set in the year
      3010, this game envisions a world where evil governments are desperate for something good to put on TV to
      entertain their teeming masses. The solution - a race.
      In this race the runner races around an obstacle strewn track chased by a machine that is a cross between a tank
      and a steam roller. Stay ahead and you win, get caught and you're history.

      The game is controlled by the keyboard. It is a little unusual in that the player's point of view is always above
      and in front of the runner, looking back at them as they run towards the camera. The track is littered with
      objects which the runner must either avoid, jump over, or duck under. These obstacles can just pop up out of the
      track as the runner approaches so quick reactions are needed</story>

    <story>In 2102 C.E., a giant asteroid enters Earth's orbit, and inside is a horde of aliens led by the entity
      Diadora, unleashing an invasion on mankind. Hiding deep underground, the surviving rebels create three
      experimental robots, Sophia, Calista and Dynamis, to combat Diadora's army, the objective codenamed "Operation
      ExZeus". These three robots are humanity's last hope.

      ExZeus is an on-rails arcade shooter in a third-person perspective. The player can move in all directions while
      progressing forward, shooting enemies and collecting power-ups and gold. The player has the ability to lock onto
      enemies and fire powerful missiles at them, and also has a laser (which recharges by itself after every use) they
      can launch by holding down the fire button. The player can also send out nuclear bombs that destroy all of the
      enemies on screen, which can also be used to help with bosses.

      At the end of every level, the player faces a boss. Before the fight begins, a screen will display the weaknesses
      of that boss. Successfully defeating a boss will bring the player to the item shop, where they can buy items to
      power up their robot, and then proceed to the next level.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      structures, bumps in the track, motion-captured pit crews, animated grid girls, and planes and helicopters in the
      sky above.

      The cars in the game feature realistic driving physics and damage models that take into account the materials that
      the various components are made of. Fortunately, players have access to the same kind of data telemetry that real
      drivers and their teams do, so it should be possible to devise car setups that are appropriate for each circuit

    <story>A simulation of the TV game show of the same name. Two families will compete against each other to choose the
      most common answers to questions such as "Things a jockey needs", or "Clothes that don't go on hangers". More than
      1000 questions are included.

      The 2006 edition has both standard and quick games. The standard game contains 5 rounds. In rounds 1-4, two people
      are selected, one from each team, who compete to buzz in a common answer to the question on the board. The team
      that wins control then has to figure out the other common answers, earning a strike for any answers that are not
      common. If any common answers remain after that team's third strike, the other team has a chance to steal all the
      points for that round by guessing an unrevealed answer. In rounds 3 and 4, the stakes are higher. In round 5, two
      people from the winning team work together to find common answers to questions before time runs out. The quick
      game has just one family, who has to guess the common answers to a question. Finding all answers earns bonus
      points.

      The standard game can be played against the computer, another player on the same computer, or over the Internet.
      Answer questions by typing them out or using the on-screen keyboard; the computer will recognize word variations
      and some misspellings. A family editor is included, which lets you edit body type and clothing. By playing the
      game, new clothing options and studios will be unlocked.</story>

    <story>This fireworks-based puzzle title is notable for being the only title available from Sony on the PlayStation
      2's launch date. In a manner similar to Missile Command, the goal is to select and detonate matched groups of
      flares. Using the analog stick to point from flare to flare, a player must link three or more similar flares and
      set them off in a chain of fireworks explosions. The bigger the chain, the higher your score.
      Each level has a predetermined length and a set course, scrolling through cities, outer space, and unknown
      territories. With a limited amount of energy, players stay alive by detonating as many flares as possible, and by
      grabbing various power-ups as they appear onscreen. Collecting enough "star" power-ups releases a "Starmine" flare
      -- a sort of bonus round, rapid-fire succession of flares.
      Upon successfully completing a level, you can watch a replay using various camera angles and add different
      lighting and weather effects. You can also store your best rounds on a memory card and show your fireworks
      displays off to your friends. Skilled players will be able to unlock a few extra options once they complete the

      went to investigate a mansion that once was inhabited by a powerful landowner who had absolute control over the
      area. Unfortunately, they never returned from their investigation. Miku enters the mansion, armed with only an
      antique camera given to her by her deceased mother, to try to find her brother.

      While inside the mansion, Miku will encounter ghosts and other spiritual apparitions. In order to overcome these
      spirits and survive, she must use the magical camera to capture the ghosts on film, thereby trapping them forever.
      Ghosts range from invisible fragments hidden in scenery, to memories of the past that appear only for a moment
      before vanishing, to full body apparitions that will attempt to attack and kill Miku.

      In order to defeat an aggressive ghost the Camera Obscura's shot must first be "charged" by keeping the ghost
      centered while it is visible. If Miku snaps a shot while the ghost is attacking or is vulnerable then she will
      drain even more energy from it, resulting in more spirit points being earned. Points can then be spent to improve
      her camera's attributes or give it special abilities, like slowing a ghost or pushing it away. The Camera Obscura
      can also reveal clues and dispel illusions, which Miku will need to utilize to solve puzzles within the mansion.

    <story>Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli is a re-make of F355 Challenge: Passione Rossa and made after Ferrari's
      actual racing series in which professional and amateur racers take part in a series of races sponsored by Ferrari.
      There are 16 different International tracks to compete in ranging from Silverstone in England to Homestead-Miami
      Speedway in Florida and features over 50 different Ferrari models to race in.

      There are a variety of modes to choose from: Challenge, Arcade, Quick Race, Time Trial and features the technical
      expertise of GP2 driver, Bruno Senna, who is the nephew of Formula One legend Ayrton to give the cars and game a
      more realistic feel including handling and a responsive AI similar to their real-life counterparts.

      While the games are similar there are some differences such as graphics and control scheme (the PS2 and PS3 use a
      similar scheme while the Wii utilizes the Wii-Remote and the Wii Wheel). Also the PS3 has online capabilities
      where players can compete in online races.</story>

    <story>Featuring a brand new engine (replacing the one used in five titles since FIFA 2003), FIFA 06 features new
      controls and gameplay, the most visible being more animations and better detailed ball and player physics and
      animation, the removal of the unpopular Off the Ball controls implemented in their 2004 version and remaking the
      free-kick interface so it's no longer obvious if the player decided for a shot on goal or a pass to a forward.
      Also new is the concept of "Team Chemistry" which affects how well a team plays collectively.

      Featuring 26 leagues from 19 countries, 29 real stadiums and over 10'000 players with data for the 2005-06
      seasons, as well as international teams, the game kept the "Create a player" feature as well as the many managing
      options untouched from previous versions. Career mode, the 15-year long climb to the top of the game, features new
      options such as sponsorships (which will only accept good results), player contracts and more weight on the player
      morale: a demoralized player (usually from not playing or possible influence from random events) is more likely to
      under-perform as well as pressuring the "Team Chemistry" values downwards and might refuse attempts to renew his
      contract, leaving on a free transfer.

      While there are still many unlockables in the game (mostly third kits), the way to earn points changed. Instead of
      gaining points from completing tasks (from entering the EA Trax or creating a player to winning the Champions
      League or completing a career), the player has over 100 scenarios to way in five difficulty levels.</story>

      Canada and published by Electronic Arts. It was released in October 2003 with the tagline "Create Brilliance".

      FIFA Football 2004 is the eleventh game in the FIFA series and the eighth to be in 3D. While not adding much to
      the engine used in FIFA Football 2003, the biggest new inclusions were secondary divisions, which allow the player
      to take lower ranked teams to promotion attempts. Gameplay has a new feature dubbed "Off the ball", which allows
      the control of two players at the same time for greater tactical play. Another key feature was Football Fusion,
      which allows owners of both FIFA 2004 and Total Club Manager 2004 to play games from the management sim in FIFA.
      The title sequence was filmed in St James' Park, home of Newcastle United, with the opening song being Kings of
      Leon's European hit "Red Morning Light".

      The cover features Alessandro Del Piero of Juventus, Thierry Henry of Arsenal, and Ronaldinho in a Brazil kit.

    <story>Fight Club is based on David Fincher's film adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. Fed up with
      consumerist American culture, a fight club is founded as a new type of therapy through bare-knuckle fighting. The
      game focuses on the fights and uses many characters and environments from the original story. You can create a new
      fighter or clone one of the generated characters. There are three general fighting styles to choose from:
      grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped
      clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points
      (CDP's) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character.

      Aside from the regular arcade, survival and training mode, there is a story mode in which you need to work your
      way up as a rookie to become a key player in Project Mayhem in a storyline very loosely based on the original
      plot. Both the PS2 and Xbox version have an online multiplayer mode as well.</story>

    <story>EA's Fight Night returns in its second installment. Once again, you can create a new boxer and start a career
      that begins as an amateur in a shady gym somewhere in Queens, NY and fight your way up to the top. Alternatively,
      you could relive the careers of some legendary boxers.

      Of course, you could go for a simple match with either a computer or a live opponent.

      Round 2 offers many new features, like fancy particle effects that show blood and sweat spraying into the camera
      in ultra slow-motion. The "Total Boxer Control", which lets you throw punches by making certain movements with the
      analog stick, has been improved. There are also many ways to customize the appearance of your character, up to the
      shaping of the cranium and ears.

      The soundtrack consists of a dozen contemporary (but unfortunately edited) hip-hop tracks.</story>

    <story>EA Sports' Fight Night Round 3 from EA Chicago lets you make your own fighter, train them up, and literally
      take on the world.

      Start by creating your own champ and customizing how they look, what equipment they have, their fighting style,
      their weight class, their signature move, and even their own illegal hit. Get equipment and trainers for your
      fighter to enhance his look and performance.

      Then take your fighter to career mode where you'll play fight your way up from the local gym all the way up to
      five-star venues. Get trainers to enhance your training and boost your speed and power. Play against randomly
      generated fighters all the way up through the ranks till you beat them in points or to a pulp. Certain fights may
      get you a bit of extra money as an incentive, or give you a promotional deal, but pick your fights carefully
      because strategy inside the ring won't matter if you mismanage your fisher outside.

      Fight smart during the fight by using the total punch control system to throw the punches you want to by using the
      analog stick. The total punch control system maps your fists to the analog stick getting rid of the need for
      senseless button mashing.

      You can also play in historical fights like Taylor vs. Hopkins, Gatti vs. Ward, or Robinson vs. Lamotta in the
      ESPN Classic mode to play in the fights that made boxing history.

      Once you've got the computer down for the count, you can play with any fighter or user created fighters or any of
      the ESPN Classic fights in local multiplayer with a friend. You can also take the fight online and prove your the
      real champion of the world against any opponent anytime, anywhere.</story>

    <story>Fighting Angels is a story-less 3D fighting game featuring an all-female cast. The game is a 1-on-1 fighting
      game with minor wrestling influences: players can freely move in all directions around the arena, the ropes
      surrounding the arena can be incorporated into the fighting, and there is ground-based grappling much like in
      wrestling.

      Each character has four attacks -- weak and strong punches and kicks -- which have three variations each. Besides
      normal attacks, there are so-called "Sexy Attack", which are weaker than normal attacks but are much flashier and
      will build the character's "Sexy Gauge". There are also "Plain Attack", which are more traditional but drain the
      Sexy Gauge. If a character's Sexy Gauge is full, they'll have a chance to use a super-powerful Sexy Combo Attack,
      which is often powerful enough to completely drain the opponent's health. It is also possible to block and use a
      basic grab move, as well as pick up objects around the arena to use as weapons.

      The game includes a number of different modes. The main single-player mode is tournament mode, in which the player
      chooses a character and tries to defeat each computer opponent in order. There is also a standard versus mode for
      one or two players, a survival mode, and a practice mode. As is the standard for Tamsoft's Simple 2000 sports
      games, there is also a view mode where the player can dress and of the characters in any unlocked outfit and watch

    <story>In this underwater action-adventure, players take the role of the title character: a small, freshwater fish
      who finds himself in a (number of) big ponds (not to mention streams, lakes, and rivers). At the beginning of the
      game, Finny learns from a wizened old turtle that a great destiny lays before him, and that he must leave the
      safety of his home and travel the wide waters to find it. With representations of over 100 different species of
      underwater life, the game is full of small bugs and fish for Finny to eat, and large fish and animals that are
      interested in eating Finny. Unpredictable currents, hidden bonus areas, and (especially) fisherman's lures all

      explore and many action-oriented puzzles to solve. Some gameplay elements may be reminiscent of the later, 3D
      incarnations of Ecco the Dolphin, but Finny's adventures are presented in a slightly more "anime" (if not
      anthropomorphized) style. Originally known as Uo the Fish: The Seven Waters and the Gods, the North American
      release of Finny the Fish is the result of an unusual collaboration between eccentric publisher Natsume, the Sega
      staple design studio WOW Entertainment, and the PS2's own home team, Sony Computer Entertainment of Japan.</story>

    <story>Fire ProWrestling Returns is a 2D-graphic based wrestling simulation game. The game has a
      north-south/east-west-axis movement system. This allows for dual-plane movement rendering it to play like a 3D
      wrestling game (although the moves are still done in 2D).

      The game features 327 wrestlers on the main roster, from over 10 major Japanese wrestling and mixed-martial arts
      organizations. This in-depth roster allows the player to simulate classic matches or matches that could never take
      place.

      Game modes include a standard exhibition match, tag team exhibition match with 2, 3 or 4 player teams, a round
      robin league tournament featuring up to 64 wrestlers, a sudden elimination tournament featuring up to 16
      wrestlers, mixed martial arts matches aka Ultimate Fighting (with either Pride or K*1 Rules), battle royal matches
      with up to eight players in the ring at the same time, 5-man team elimination matches and for the first time ever
      in a Fire ProWrestling game, a North American cage match mode.

      The edit mode allows you to create wrestlers, referees and even entire wrestling organizations (with their own
      ring and logo). This mode features over 1,648 moves and holds you can assign to your wrestlers, and you can then
      tweak their CPU logic, so as to make them behave as you like when controlled by the computer.

      The new features for the Fire ProWrestling series debuting in Fire ProWrestling Returns are North American cage
      matches, face layering on edit mode, and ring seconds (aka managers) that accompany wrestlers to the ring. It also
      features over 20 brand new moves, including some reanimations of old moves.</story>

    <story>Ford Bold Moves Street Racing is the third Razorworks-developed title in the licensed Ford Racing series

      The road races, off-road challenges and circuit tracks have been removed and the action has been taken entirely to

      Fords, ranging from the 1968 Mustang GT to the 2007 Shelby GT 500.

      There are 4 main modes: Quick Race, Team Racing, Solo Racing and Multiplayer. Solo Racing offers quick races, and
      championships where new vehicles and tracks can be unlocked. The real novelty is the Team Racing mode, split up in
      single races, team championships, challenges and tutorials. Team Racing has the player control two or three
      vehicles in a single team during a race in modes such as Race, Elimination or Duel. The team with the highest
      point total wins, so the player either has to switch between the vehicles to drive (the others cars then become
      AI-controlled) or issue orders such as Block (slow down another vehicle) or Draft (additional speed in the
      slipstream) to influence the driving behaviour of the team mates. This can be extended to double or even triple
      actions of the same effect. Blocked cars have to brake and weave across the track until they regain control.

    <story>Formula One 05 for the PlayStation 2 was released in Europe on July 1, 2005, and in Australia later that
      year. It featured the 'Career Mode' concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through
      the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 season each time). This
      game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their
      profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet. The cover athletes are Jenson Button, David
      Coulthard and Narain Karthikeyan.

      Players start out testing for a smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car
      does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their
      'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor
      performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests
      against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in
      which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on
      the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view
      trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first
      time.

      As with F1 04, "classic" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as
      winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the
      Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France([citation
      needed])) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the
      qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original "aggregated times"
      format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode.
      This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song "Butterflies &amp;
      Hurricanes" from English alternative rock band Muse.

      For the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the
      shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of
      ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula
      One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI.

      However, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty
      system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of
      the traditional "drive-through" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart
      from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the
      inevitable release of the 2006 edition.

    <story>Freekstyle is a EA Sports' take on motocross racing. This game is all about going fast and doing cool tricks.
      There are essentially two games here: first there is a straightforward racing game, where you race three laps
      around a circuit and attempt to finish first. The second part of the game is a freestyle competition, where you
      perform tricks to score points, and attempt to rack up the biggest total.

      The racing game, or "Freekstyle" mode, combines racing and tricks. You will race around a circuit track, and
      attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way. Performing tricks fills your boost meter,
      which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion. If you perform enough tricks, eventually you
      can break into "freakout" mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed.

      Freekstyle features the voices and likeness of several real-life motocross stars.</story>

    <story>Freestyle MetalX is, as the name implies, a motocross stunt game. It contains 9 pro riders and twelve

      career mode that is a succession of levels, each one containing goals like doing specific tricks, finding gaps and
      finding things, which could take the form of breaking windows, running people over, etc. In this case, there are
      also racing goals. Each goal gives you money, which can be used to unlock new riders, bikes and levels.

      Controls consist of an accelerator, brake and clutch along with jump, trick and trick modifier buttons. The
      modifier can be used to turn a superman into a nothing superman, for instance. Wheelies are controlled with the

    <story>Front Mission 5: Scars of the War is the fifth in Square's Front Mission tactical RPG series. It brings the
      player back to a gritty futuristic world in which conflicts are waged between five world powers: the U.S.N.,
      O.C.U., E.C., O.A.C., and the Republic of Zaftra. Such conflicts are waged with the wanzer, Front Mission-speak
      for mecha.

      Gameplay-wise, the game is a true return to Front Mission 2 roots while incorporating various features from Front
      Mission 1, 3, and 4. The player takes part in turn-based missions, which pit their group of wanzers against enemy
      forces. Old features that have returned include the ability to upgrade parts and mission branching. New features
      to Front Mission 5 include friendly fire and the ability to recruit new pilots.

      Unlike the previous games which were fairly standalone, Front Mission 5 covers the time period from 2070 to 2121.
      In effect, it goes through conflicts seen in the previous games as the years pass by. Through the eyes of U.S.N.
      soldier/officer Walter Feng, the player experiences his story as he deals with the aforementioned conflicts. With
      the passing of time, he becomes witness to hidden truths and accounts. Eventually, Feng is drawn to the on-going

      According to an unlockable documentary snippet included in-game, development began before the September 11th

      terrorist Al Afad.

      In the game, you don't directly control your troops. You don't take aim at a target and shoot, and you don't
      circle-strafe around enemies. Instead, you tell your squad what to do, and they'll do it. It's like a real-time
      strategy game. You can tell your two squads to do numerous things, such as hide behind a wall, take cover behind a
      car, lob a grenade, fire off a rocket, or attack a target. You will need to utilize both squads to be successful.
      For example, you can have Alpha squad hide behind a car and lay down covering fire at a target that you can't
      directly kill, giving Bravo squad cover so they may cross open terrain, and get into a position where they will be
      able to kill the enemy.

      The game takes place in one locations, a Middle Eastern country, that's split up into several areas. You'll have
      to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many
      terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you. You have four members on each squad; the Team Leader, Automatic
      Rifleman, Grenadier and Rifleman. Each plays a unique role.

      Full Spectrum Warrior supports Xbox Live, where two players can play through the single player campaign. Instead
      of controlling both squads, one player controls Alpha while the other controls Bravo.</story>

    <story>Futakoi Alternative (aka Twin Love Alternative) is a spin off of a TV anime with the same name. As the title
      implies, Futakoi Alternative is an alternate version based on the original Futakoi TV anime and video game. While
      some characters are recurring, the setting and everything is completely different, like an alternate version of
      the overall story (think parallel universe where base is the same, characters are the same, but everything happens
      differently).
      The story focuses on Rentarou Futaba and his detective agency. One day, a pair of twins, Sara and Souju Shirogane,
      appear at his place and start working as his secretaries at the agency. But Sara and Souju are by far not the only
      twin sisters that appear in the game. Unlike most of static visual novels, Futakoi Alternative includes a couple
      of quick-time modes during the adventure part of the game where you have to press the right button before the time
      runs out. The game also includes CG and BGM player in the extras section of the main menu.</story>

    <story>This fireworks-based puzzle title is notable for being the only title available from Sony on the PlayStation
      2's launch date. In a manner similar to Missile Command, the goal is to select and detonate matched groups of
      flares. Using the analog stick to point from flare to flare, a player must link three or more similar flares and
      set them off in a chain of fireworks explosions. The bigger the chain, the higher your score.
      Each level has a predetermined length and a set course, scrolling through cities, outer space, and unknown
      territories. With a limited amount of energy, players stay alive by detonating as many flares as possible, and by
      grabbing various power-ups as they appear onscreen. Collecting enough "star" power-ups releases a "Starmine" flare
      -- a sort of bonus round, rapid-fire succession of flares.
      Upon successfully completing a level, you can watch a replay using various camera angles and add different
      lighting and weather effects. You can also store your best rounds on a memory card and show your fireworks
      displays off to your friends. Skilled players will be able to unlock a few extra options once they complete the
      regular game, including a Master Chain mode.</story>

    <story>Matt Groening's "other" animated series makes its video game debut as a third-person shooter that has players
      blasting their way across time in an effort to stop the entity known as Mom from taking over the universe. The
      game casts players in the role of Fry, Bender, Leela, or Dr. Zoidberg, with each character having his or her own
      distinct moves and weapons. In their quest to right a terrible wrong, players will run through futuristic New New
      York (in the year 3000), revisit "old" New York, confront Sun Priests in Sun City, attack swamp monsters and
      gators lurking in the Bogad Bayou, and zip across an asteroid belt to zap giant robotic monsters living in a
      junkyard of space relics.


      In addition to shooting enemies with their character's default weapon, players can perform basic moves such as
      jumping or climbing to reach new areas or to avoid potential hazards. Puzzle-solving aspects involve activating
      generators before using elevators on certain stages, and simply flipping the occasional switch or lever. Writers
      from the FOX television series created the game's story and dialogue, with design input offered by show creator
      Matt Groening himself. To maintain the vibrant yet simple look of the sci-fi series, the developers made use of a
      "toon-shading render engine" created specifically for the game. Actors from the original cast also provide the
      voice-overs for each of the main characters.</story>

    <story>After Commodore Perry "encouraged" the Japanese to sign the Treaty of Kanagawa on March 31st, 1854 and
      therefore opened up trade with the United States, Japan was thrown into chaos. Japan's 200 years of self-imposed
      isolation ended and the samurai ranks began to question the power of the Tokugawa Shogunate and its ability to
      defend Japan. In his second trip to Japan, Perry had threatened to shell Edo if his demands were not met and the
      Shogunate had buckled too easily to his whims. Journeying from the whole of Japan, marauding bands of roshis
      (masterless samurai warriors - not ronins or rurounis) gathered in Kyoto and sought to topple the perceived weak
      Shogunate and repel the western invaders who had arrived on the black ships.
      Fuun Bakumatsuden is the sequel to Fu-un Shinsen Gumi. Unlike the previous game, where you play as the samurai
      guards to protect the lords from the attacks of Tenchu ninjas. This time the situation is reversed, you play as
      the assassinating samurais, your missions are to defeat the samurai guards and find chances to kill their lords.

      as in Japanese. However, most Mandarin-speaking Chinese now call the game m? ji?ng.
      Mahjong involves skill, strategy, and calculation, as well as a certain degree of luck (depending on the variation
      played, luck can be anything from a minor to a dominant factor in winning). In Asia, mahjong is also popularly
      played as a gambling game. In the game, each player is dealt either thirteen or sixteen tiles in a hand, depending
      on the variation being played. On their turn, players draw a tile and discard one, with the goal of making four or
      five melds (also depending on the variation) and one pair, or "head". Winning comes "on the draw" by drawing a new
      or discarded tile that completes the hand. Thus, a winning hand actually contains fourteen (or seventeen) tiles.

    <story>Fancy hats, oval turf tracks and people waving tiny bits of paper on the stands. Welcome to the world of
      horse racing. While most other racing games have the player controlling a motorized vehicle (such as a car or a
      powerboat), or using physics to move closer to the goal (skiing, sailing and so on), in G1 Jockey the player is
      controlling an animal, which makes it slightly different from other racing games in the market.

      The player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the
      potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost - crucial for
      the last stretch sprint. It's impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy
      to succeed.

      Depending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and
      each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses,
      and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a
      tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete
      races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.</story>

    <story>A racing game in the Choro Q series. This title differs slightly differently compared to other games. There
      are no RPG elements to this game, with tracks and races chosen through a menu system similar to a Gran Turismo
      title rather than talking to other cars.

      The player starts by choosing one of six car bodies. Later the other bodies can be purchased through the shop,
      along with other variants (bodies are purely cosmetic). Upgrading the player's vehicle is done by buying parts.
      Many of the parts are normal for racing games (engines, tires etc.) with some more specialized parts like wings or
      skis. Money is gained by completing races, a bonus is added depending on your position.</story>

    <story>Gaelic football is a popular sport in Ireland. It's similar to soccer in so far as you got a goalie on each
      end, but it also has similarities with basketball since you can lift the ball off the ground with your hands, hand
      pass etc. Players will pass, kick and carry the ball up the other end of the field, and will attempt to score
      while attempting to dodge opponent players trying to gain possession of the ball.

      The goals are a bit different to soccer as well, the player can attempt to kick the ball past the goalie for
      higher points, but they can also kick the ball over the goalies head where the goalie can't defend for fewer
      points.</story>

      race. Horses vary not only in appearance, but in ability as well, with particular strengths and weaknesses in
      regard to temperament and guts, amongst others. Additionally, each has specific preferences pertaining to turf on

      played, luck can be anything from a minor to a dominant factor in winning). In Asia, mahjong is also popularly
      played as a gambling game. In the game, each player is dealt either thirteen or sixteen tiles in a hand, depending

      five melds (also depending on the variation) and one pair, or "head". Winning comes "on the draw" by drawing a new
      or discarded tile that completes the hand. Thus, a winning hand actually contains fourteen (or seventeen) tiles.

    <story>Garfield is a comic strip created by Jim Davis. Published since June 19, 1978, it chronicles the life of the
      title character, the cat Garfield (named after Davis's grandfather); his owner, Jon Arbuckle; and Arbuckle's dog,
      Odie. As of 2007, it was syndicated in roughly 2,580 newspapers and journals, and held the Guinness World Record
      for being the world's most widely syndicated comic strip.
      Garfield is taking his nap, as usual, when he is awakened by the dog Odie. From the corner of his eye, he gets a
      glimpse of his pal Arlene, being taken away in a pound car. Despite his natural laziness, he decides to rescue his
      on-and-off girlfriend, along with Odie. Based on the comics and incorporation the known sense of humour, Garfield
      and Odie travel through a 3D world solving puzzles that involve doors, keys, but also team-based actions with your
      partner. Of course there are enemies to defeat, such as bad dogs and evil piranhas.</story>

    <story>Garfield: A Tail Of Two Kitties is a game based on the movie of the same title. It shares the premise with
      the movie, according to which, Garfield, a sarcastic feline from the United States, has been mistakenly identified
      as Prince of Carlye Castle in United Kingdom. The real prince was kidnapped and now it is up to Garfield and his
      new-found friends to uncover the devious plot of Lord Dargis and return the rightful heir to his throne.

      Gameplay is based around the familiar 3D platform games mechanics. The player takes control of Garfield and his
      fellow animals: Christophe the goose and Claudius the mouse in order to explore the five non-linear levels of the
      huge castle complex, helping other inhabitants on his way and participating in various activities including:
      racing, time challenges, mazes, dances and so on. Upon achieving a certain objective Garfield may be awarded
      additional powers, which will gain him access to the next level.</story>

    <story>Building upon the foundation laid by Gauntlet Legends, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy offers more levels and items as
      well as new characters and in-game scripted events. Playable by up to four players simultaneously, the goal is a
      simple one: destroy all the enemies in your path, while searching for a way to exit each world. Standing between
      you and the exit are traps and hordes of enemies that spew forth from generators scattered about the environment.
      Destroying these generators is the only way to stem the tide of evil warriors.
      Eight characters are initially selectable -- with others hidden in the game ranging from the sublime to the
      ridiculous. A knight, sorceress, dwarf, and jester are just a small cross-section of the different classes, with
      each possessing a unique power to aid them in their quest. The special powers' effectiveness increases as your
      Turbo meter fills, and slowly regenerates over time. Aiding your slaughter of the swarms of evildoers is a
      plethora of items: explosive magic vials, multiple projectile attacks, and limited invulnerability are just a few
      of the many items that can be found or purchased. Unlike the original arcade titles, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy has a
      finite end, one which players will uncover after traversing the game's 60 stages.</story>

    <story>Gauntlet is back for yet another iteration. The Emperor has crucified his four loyal heroes to a magic tree,
      driven by a maniac thirst for their immortality. Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all
      the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo
      what he has done.

      This version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through
      hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are
      limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of
      moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot
      powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks.

      Defeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the
      levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold.

      The game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight
      together.

      The newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature. Played online,
      the game is identical to a regular multiplayer game, with each player on a different box.</story>

      procedure. You play one of these civilians. First they took your daughter and then they came for you. But before
      the procedure was completed, you were rescued by the rebels. Now it's your turn to fight back.

      Gene Troopers is basically a shooter but it lets you build and upgrade your weapons with stuff you find lying
      around. You can also extract the genes of an enemy to upgrade your own. With these codes you can choose in which
      direction you want to go with your character. This means you can either choose to upgrade your stealth abilities
      or to devote them to becoming a fighter.

      The game takes you to 6 different planets including a jungle world. There are drivable vehicles and team members
      to help you with your task.</story>

    <story>Based loosely on the influential, 11th century romantic novel The Tale of Genji, Genji: Dawn of the Samurai
      is a combat-focused adventure set in a feudal Japan rife with magic and mystery. Players alternate between control
      of two lead characters: the young, lithe Yoshitsune, who wields twin samurai blades, and the grizzled, burly
      Benkei, who fights with an enormous club. Success in battle allows players to gradually upgrade their characters'
      skills. The game's story leads them on a journey of discovery and honor, through a foreign land where they are
      often met with distrust and aggression.
      Acting as the historic hero Genkuro Yoshitsune or his trusted companion Benkei, the warrior monk, you set out on a
      mission to release the oppressed from the evil forces of the warlord Kiyomori and restore the Genji dynasty to
      power.</story>

    <story>An orphan boy was brought up in a noble household on the island of Razril, part of a federation known as the
      Island Nations, which is threatened by their powerful neighbor, the Kooluk Empire. When the boy grows up, he
      trains together with other young people, hoping to become a knight in the Gaien order. One day, during an escort
      mission, the knights' ship is attacked by pirates. Through a series of events, the hero is branded with the Rune
      of Punishment, one of the twenty-seven legendary True Runes. While devastating the enemies, this rune is also
      bound to deplete its bearer's life. Blamed for the death of his commander, who was unable to withstand the power
      of the rune, the young knight is exiled from his homeland. He must find a way to use his powers for the good of
      the Island Nations, fight against a Kooluk invasion, and restore his honor in the process.

      Suikoden IV is a prequel to the entire series. The events of the game take place a hundred and fifty years before
      those of the first game, and the region of the Suikoden universe they occur in are the islands south of Toran. The
      game retains many classic features of the series: the ability to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny);
      building and customization of army headquarters (this time a large ship instead of a castle); emphasis on
      political issues in the story; the ability to equip runes of various kinds in combat that allow the usage of magic
      spells, etc.

      The amount of active combatants in the party has been reduced from six to four in this installment. Once again,
      there are three types of combat in the game: the most frequent turn-based party-vs.-party combat, duels, and
      tactical battles, which now take place on sea. The player can customize the the naval forces by choosing captains
      and commanding officers, and assigning to them runic elements. Each element has strengths and weaknesses to
      another one, and the player must use them tactically to gain the upper hand. Ship placement on the battle grid and
      attack angles play a role as well.

      New to the series is ship navigation - instead of exploring an overworld on foot, the player navigates a ship,
      discovering new lands and islands. Also for the first time in the series there is voice acting, a fully rotatable
      camera, and the possibility to navigate the main character from first-person perspective.</story>

    <story>Get On Da Mic is a karaoke game based exclusively on Hip-Hop songs. Players have to sing along with the songs
      as a version plays sung by an amateur singer and the lyrics scroll along on the screen. The singer's voice is
      adapted based on the player's timing, pitch is not taken into account. The songs are not sung by the original
      performers, but re-recorded. Scoring is based on the overall timing of the words. The words do not have to be sung
      correctly. It also registers when random noises are made as long as the timing is correct. As it mostly consists
      of rap songs, there is a bar and spacing between the words to provide help with the lyrical flow, along with a
      moving color highlighting the words. Songs can be sung in three difficulty levels. When performing well, a meter
      is filled up until the rock the mic sequence is activated, adding snow to the location or money falling from the
      sky.</story>

    <story>Mark Hammond is an ex-gangster who wants to forget his past and live honestly with his wife and little son.
      Everything goes horribly wrong when London's most vicious criminal, the organized crime boss Charlie Jolson,
      decides that he needs Mark's services and obtains them in a twisted and cruel way: Mark's wife is murdered, he is
      framed for this murder, and his child gets kidnapped.

      Jolson makes it clear: unless Mark does what he orders him to do, the boy dies. Using the helpless man in his plan
      to bring down other criminal organizations of the city, Jolson sends Mark on suicidal missions during which Mark
      has three terrible choices: walk away and lose his son, get killed in a battle against overwhelming odds, or
      single-handedly help Jolson to get rid of his adversaries.

      Once the player completes Mark Hammond's story, a new scenario opens, in which the player controls Frank Carter, a
      vigilante cop who won't stop until he brings Charlie Jolson to justice. Frank's scenario is parallel to Mark's,
      shedding more light on events that remain somewhat unexplained during Mark's scenario.</story>

    <story>GetBackers is a Japanese manga series written by Yuya Aoki and illustrated by Rando Ayamine. The series was
      serialized and is published by Kodansha's Weekly Shonen Magazine from 1999 until 2007, totaling 39 volumes. The
      plot follows the "GetBackers", a group that retrieves anything that was lost. The team is primarily composed of
      Ban Mido, a man born with the illusionary technique "Evil Eye", and Ginji Amano the former leader of a gang called
      "The VOLTS", a powerful group in the dangerous territory called the Infinity Fortress in Shinjuku.
      PLOT:
      The series tells the story of Ginji Amano and Ban Mido, a pair of super powered individuals known as the
      "GetBackers". The duo operates a freelance repossession service out of one of the seedier areas of Shinjuku,
      Tokyo. For a fee, they will recover any lost or stolen item for a client with "an almost 100% success rate". The
      GetBackers' job often leads them into bizarre and dangerous situations in order to "get back what shouldn't be
      gone". Their targets range from lost video games to misplaced components of an atomic bomb. The plot mostly
      revolves around their adventures, often complicated by the pair's convoluted, individual pasts and a mysterious
      place known as the Infinity Fortress.</story>

    <story>The game is based on the manga series Get Backers. You control two characters, Ben and Ginji, who possess
      special powers that allow them to find and to recover items, valuables, and even people who got lost. Now they are
      offered a huge sum of money for a recovery job they have to do for a mysterious customer from an even more
      mysterious Castle of Infinity.

      The gameplay is based on exploration of randomly generated dungeons. You search for items and also trigger
      important cut scenes by exploring every corner in the dungeons. The action-based combat resembles a fighting game.
      You can perform a variety of moves, block your opponent's attack, and switch between the characters. Attacks
      deplete your stamina bar, so continuously using the strongest attacks is not always the best choice. When your
      stamina bar is full, you can perform powerful combo attacks.</story>

    <story>Ghost Master: The Gravenville Chronicles is the console version of the PC game Ghost Master. In this strategy
      game, you become the scourge of humanity by managing haunting teams consisting of various ghosts. The levels,
      usually inspired by famous scenes from horror movies, require you to scare mortals and complete additional
      objectives such as freeing trapped ghosts. Deployed ghosts need to be bound to certain objects, called fetters,
      that match their type.

      By scaring humans, you collect plasm, the main resource in the game. Plasm can be used to recruit new ghosts, or
      expand their abilities. Rather than deploying a massive amount of creatures, the game rewards creative use of
      limited resources to haunt mortals in original ways. Each human has a believe meter. An important aspect is
      figuring out each human's weakness. As you exploit this, they become more susceptible to various phenomena and
      provide more plasm. Along the way, you will meet fierce resistance as ghostbreakers, priests and witches can
      detect and ban your ghosts.

      The game is not a direct port. Instead, Spiral House was contracted to modify the original codebase by Sick
      Puppies to make it more user-friendly for the consoles. This includes a complete overhaul of the interface to make
      commands easier to access, the introduction of battle elements - next to the regular missions - to speed up the
      game's pace, a more linear game structure, and a redesign of the control over ghosts. They now have less AI and
      there is more variety in the types, requiring you to tap wisely into the plasm pool to deploy the most adequate
      ghost for each situation.</story>

    <story>Fancy hats, oval turf tracks and people waving tiny bits of paper on the stands. Welcome to the world of
      horse racing. While most other racing games have the player controlling a motorized vehicle (such as a car or a
      powerboat), or using physics to move closer to the goal (skiing, sailing and so on), in G1 Jockey the player is
      controlling an animal, which makes it slightly different from other racing games in the market.

      The player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the
      potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost - crucial for
      the last stretch sprint. It's impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy
      to succeed.

      Depending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and
      each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses,
      and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a
      tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete
      races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.</story>

      Next is the reflect force; this acts as a temporary shield and any bullets that are encountered are gathered and

      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay.
      This distinction is normally lost outside Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual
      novels" by international fans. Visual novels and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly

    <story>Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance is an action game that takes place in the times of the Roman empire. You take
      control of Invictus Thrax, a Roman slave, who ascended through the ranks to become champion of all gladiators.
      Favored by the emperor, Invictus was to be granted his freedom. Mysteriously though, the emperor was killed and
      replaced by a crazy man named Arruntius. Arruntius, so full of himself, has decided to destroy Rome and replace it
      with a city named Arruntium. As the game begins, an epic event is staged with Invictus as the gladiator. Invictus
      fights bravely, but he is killed by an unknown and possibly un-human creature. In the afterlife, Invictus meets
      the sons of Jupiter. They inform him of how Arruntius' power came from help of the gods of terror. They charge him

    <story>God of War is an action-oriented adventure game with a strong focus on fast-paced combat. Players take
      control of Kratos, a mystically powerful hero in the ancient Greece of classic mythology. Kratos can perform
      super-human leaps, agile dodges, and magically enhanced combo attacks, which all flow together in a stream of
      intense engagement. The fast-paced, over-the-top fighting, combined with the tense environments and
      computer-directed camera angles, give gameplay the feel of combat-adventures such as Devil May Cry or Otogi.
      Unlike those earlier blends of survival-horror presentation and combat-minded control schemes, however, God of War
      is set in a world more immediately familiar to all fans of western fantasy. The ultimate goal of Kratos is a
      conclusive confrontation with Ares -- the god of war himself -- but the hero must face a deadly succession of
      monsters and villains from Greek mythology as he pursues this end. The Hydra, Medusa, the Cyclops, the Minotaur,
      and other legendary creatures will all have their chances to destroy Kratos before he meets his final destiny.

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      evil Gobblers and her uncle Lord Asriel is imprisoned when he discovers evidence that proves the existence of Dust
      particles, much to the dismay of the Magisterial representatives who rule the world as a dogmatic theocracy and do
      not allow people to contradict their doctrine. Lyra has to leave the safe haven that is Jordan College in Oxford

    <story>Invoking the name of Rare's 1997 first-person shooter for N64 -- easily its most highly acclaimed James Bond
      game predecessor -- 2004's GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is an original super spy adventure experienced from a different
      point of view. Developed by Electronic Art's Los Angeles studios, the game has players taking the role of an MI6
      agent working toward elite "00" license-to-kill status, who is dismissed for "reckless brutality." Seizing the
      opportunity to bring such a highly skilled and well-trained operative into his own organization, infamous Bond
      supervillian Auric Goldfinger welcomes the player's disenfranchised agent into his ranks.
      Like its N64 forebear, the 128-bit version of GoldenEye is a first-person shooter with lots of opportunity for
      multiplayer action. Standard deathmatches and domination games are supported, as well as a "Tug of War" game that
      has teams competing to move a bomb across the map by flipping a series of switches. Four-player split-screen play
      is offered, and properly equipped PlayStation 2 and Xbox gamers can go online to find competitive multiplayer
      games for up to eight. Also like the original, Rogue Agent features a full single-player campaign as well.</story>

    <story>The Spirits, who once protected the world, have gone loose. Running around wildly, they created monsters who
      disturbed the peace in the world and provoked two mighty nations to start an all-destroying war. After years of
      battles and pain, the two nations finally decided to sign a peace agreement. Now they wish concentrate together on
      hunting down and eliminating the insane Spirits. You control a young boy named Evan, who wants to become a Ranger
      (a fighter who possesses unique abilities), like his father. But before he can be initiated as a Ranger, he has to
      fulfill an important mission and help to save his world from the Spirits.

      Grandia Xtreme is the first Grandia game to be originally released for Playstation 2. Its combat system is
      virtually the same as in the previous two games, a mixture of strategic planning and combo attacks. Your party
      members can run around, avoid enemy attacks, and their attack power depends on their distance from the enemies.
      Grandia Xtreme is heavily based on combat, with more dungeons, more fighting, and less story than the two previous
      installments of the series.</story>

      The action is viewed from the side, and the characters include Holy Knights, assassins and bounty hunters.
      Unlockable extras form a big part of the challenge. The story modes aim to incorporate an evolving storyline with

      Hero: Aerosmith. The series, known for making gamers feel like rock stars, first put real rock stars into games
      with the inclusion of guitar gods Slash and Tom Morello as boss characters in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock,

      More of a healthy, Aerosmith-themed expansion of Guitar Hero III than a completely new entry in the series, Guitar
      Hero: Aerosmith nevertheless offers more than 40 new rock songs to which gamers can shred. The track list is heavy
      with Aerosmith classics like "Dream On," "Sweet Emotion," and "Rag Doll," but the game also features songs from

      This title largely borrows from the novelties introduced in Guitar Hero: World Tour, with band career modes for
      single or multiple players with a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the possibility to
      play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a bass guitar, drums, and doing the vocals. The
      storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their
      tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic
      the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the

      As in the previous games, in the single-player mode the player works his way through a setlist unlocking
      increasingly difficult songs, divided over 4 main difficulties. By performing well, new songs and venues become
      available, but there are less unlockables compared to the previous titles. Notable bands in this edition include A
      Flock of Seagulls, The Police, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Asia, Dio and Anthrax. Unlike the previous games, there
      are no bonus tracks.
      The game is played through the guitar controller introduced for this series. The multi-player modes include Co-op,

    <story>Instantly recognizable, due in part to the unique visual style of TRIGUN's Yasuhiro Naito, Gungrave casts
      players as Grave, an enigmatic, double-gun wielding anti-hero forged in much the same spirit as Todd McFarlane's
      Spawn character. Bent on the destruction of an evil criminal organization, Grave must traverse six unique
      environments, utilizing the dual handguns and coffin he possesses to literally destroy anything and everything in
      his path while doing so. At its most basic level, the gameplay in this third-person action title encourages
      players to destroy the various enemies along with the environments themselves. Uninterrupted carnage steadily
      increases the "Beat" meter, allowing players to achieve extended combos through carefully planned attacks. Higher
      scores and extra abilities are awarded for exemplary play.</story>

    <story>Gunparade Orchestra is a sequel of Gunparade March. It?s a sequel in the sense that they are (supposedly) set
      in the same universe, but there is no real continuity from the first series. In fact, the GPO has quite a
      different feel in terms of character and mecha designs that give it a lighter atmosphere.
      Just like in the original series, GPO is about a world that has been plagued by monsters called genjuu for fifty
      years and Japan is one of the few places on the planet still holding out. A Diet act was passed to conscript
      children to be pilots for HWT (Humanoid Walking Tanks), a new weapon developed by the Shibamura Group in 1978.
      Each high school has a company of HWT pilots and areas designated for military use. The pilots are drafted from
      the school population based on compatibility tests and have a seperate class of their own. In the original series,
      there was also a special genetically modified child who was responsible for activating PBE bombs which generate
      mini-blackholes that are used to destroy genjuu brain units.
      The main character is Sara Ishida, a graduate of an elite officer-training school called Shinbudai in Tokyo. She
      has been assigned as company commander in a remote division located somewhere in Tohoko (northeast of Japan),
      where the scenery won?t be out of place in Siberia.</story>

    <story>It is a time of war. Many leaders from different factions fight to control their land. One such leader, Liu
      Bei, has only one wish: peace. But war stands in his way, after his land Shu is attacked by the kingdom of Wei,
      led by the warlord Cao Cao, who abducts Liu Bei's beloved Diao Chan, the keeper of the Imperial Seal. Liu Bei has
      to flee, but swears to return, exact revenge on Cao Cao, and liberate the kingdom of Shu.

      Kessen II is a real-time strategy game, and a follow-up to Kessen. Unlike the first game, it is set in the Chinese
      Three Kingdoms period. The account of historical events is heavily fictionalized in the game, liberally adding new
      sub-plots (such as the entire romance angle of the story) and supernatural elements. The player can choose to
      command the armies of either Liu Bei or Cao Cao in their respective scenarios.

      The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, the most notable change being the shift to supernatural
      warfare, including the addition of magical attacks such as tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, meteor
      showers, etc. The player can now control 500 units at one time, as opposed to 100 in the previous game. New unit

      adult content removed, but in its place will be additional scenarios and graphics not seen in the original
      release. H2O is Makura's first game; a sequel named vafter and another was later produced in October 2007. The
      gameplay in H2O follows a plot line that offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses
      on the appeal of the three female main characters. There are two modes of gameplay, the Blindness Effect and
      Normal Effect, where the former plays on the fact that the protagonist is blind, and the latter mode removes the
      added element of gameplay the Blindness Effect has. The story is broken into three parts: the original
      introduction and meeting, following by a separation and reunion, and finally ending with the protagonist choosing
      one of the girls and spending the rest of the game with her.
      A manga adaptation, drawn by Kira Inugami, was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Comp Ace between 2007 and 2008. A

      which is still the name most commonly used in some southern Chinese dialects such as Cantonese and Minnan, as well
      as in Japanese. However, most Mandarin-speaking Chinese now call the game m? ji?ng.
      Mahjong involves skill, strategy, and calculation, as well as a certain degree of luck (depending on the variation
      played, luck can be anything from a minor to a dominant factor in winning). In Asia, mahjong is also popularly
      played as a gambling game. In the game, each player is dealt either thirteen or sixteen tiles in a hand, depending
      on the variation being played. On their turn, players draw a tile and discard one, with the goal of making four or
      five melds (also depending on the variation) and one pair, or "head". Winning comes "on the draw" by drawing a new
      or discarded tile that completes the hand. Thus, a winning hand actually contains fourteen (or seventeen) tiles.

    <story>Hamster Heroes is an action game based around controlling a hamster encapsulated in a ball rolling through
      environments similar to the concept of the Super Monkey Ball games. It builds on the concept of the earlier
      Habitrail Hamster Ball by the same developer and with very similar mechanics. The player steers a hamster through
      environments floating in the sky with small ledges and platforms to reach the exit without falling off. The game
      has a large amount of levels as small courses to complete and then move on, unlocking the next one. Levels can be
      played in a 'normal' mode or in a 'time attack' mode. Moving forward without interruption builds up a speed meter
      and causes the hamster to go faster. The game supports local multiplayer games through split-screen for up four
      players racing each other on the same course.</story>

      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside

    <story>Following the story and settings of the concurrently released feature film, and inspired by the fourth novel
      in J.K. Rowling's wildly successful series, the video game version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire puts
      players in control of the bespectacled boy wizard and his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. As the
      story goes, Harry is unexpectedly entered as one of Hogwarts' select representatives in the prestigious and
      dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament, and much of Goblet of Fire's gameplay is based on events in the magical
      competition.


      Players will be challenged with winding mazes, fire-breathing dragons, and duels against deadly rival wizards.
      While similar to earlier games in the Harry Potter series, Goblet of Fire boasts refined presentation and a more
      empowering control scheme, designed to give players an immediate, palpable sense the spells they cast. The game
      also introduces a cooperative mode to the series, allowing gamers to play together, as Harry and his friends, and
      accomplish goals through teamwork.</story>

    <story>In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding
      worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the
      castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching.
      Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old
      friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes
      holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage
      hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And
      Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And
      then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one
      student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies
      ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again. In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive
      a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical
      ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory. Players may
      even get sidetracked by Ron's romantic entanglements as they journey towards a dramatic climax and discover the
      identity of the Half-Blood Prince.</story>

      The gameplay and story remain true to the initial release (which was designed for home computers and the original
      PlayStation): a third-person 3D action-adventure based on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first novel
      in J.K. Rowling's explosively popular series.
      Players take the role of the prodigious young magician as he begins his first year at Hogwarts School of
      Witchcraft and Wizardry, joined by other favorite characters such as Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and even Draco
      Malfoy. Harry Potter can explore the grounds at Hogwarts, spend time with Hagrid, and even join a quick game of

      forces as well, and he may even come face-to-face with "You-Know-Who" himself before this adventure is over.

      players to continue to work and develop their farms, even after they've completed the main campaign. New features

      For those who are not familiar with the history of the series, King's Bounty was a spin-off of the Might &amp;
      Magic RPG series which was then still in its early chapters and was inspired by board games. The gameplay
      resembles a simplified Heroes of Might &amp; Magic game with only one Hero and no city improvements. Combat is
      turn-based using a set grid and stacked units.

      The goal of the game is to discover an ancient artifact by collecting pieces of a map and identifying its location
      before time runs out. Of course the player must have amassed a strong army by then because he will have to face
      the evil Dragon overlord before the end.</story>

      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside

    <story>Tomoharu Kimura, the producer of the PS2 Kengo games returns to the PS2 with a new action game which follows
      the missions of an assassin named Tatewaki Kyoujiro. Mild-mannered physician by day but killing machine during the
      midnight hours, Tatewaki serves as one member of a troup of village vigilantes who keep the peace.
      Towards the end of the Edo era under the control of the Tokugawa Shogunate, the financial position of the
      government declined which led to onerous taxation of the population. Struggling farmers rioted and added to the
      burden of the governing body and the local daimyo. As the social hierarchy saw destabilization, a population of
      thugs rose up to exert their corrupt ways and power on the citizenry.</story>

    <story>Hitman: Contracts is a third-person stealth game. Players take the role of "47", a hitman who is unlucky
      enough to get shot, and falls to the floor dying. The whole game takes place in "flashbacks", where 47 is
      reminiscing about past missions, some of which were previously seen in Hitman: Codename 47, the first game from
      the Hitman series.

      Gameplay in Hitman: Contracts is similar to the previous installments. Your job will be to complete several
      missions which involve assassinating targets all over the world. You can sneak around in disguise to avoid the
      suspicious guards, or you can instead open fire on everyone you see. When you complete your mission, you're given
      a rating - from "Mass Murderer" up to the coveted "Silent Assassin". If you manage to complete a mission with a
      "Silent Assassin" rating, you receive a reward: a special weapon (such as dual sawed-off shotguns), and you can
      try playing a previously completed mission using one of the special weapons.</story>

      missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone, and possibly fulfilling a
      couple of other objectives.

      Typically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to
      you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles -
      your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in
      clothes from killed or stunned guards.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      The WASD keys move you forward and back, left and right, and the mouse controls camera movement and some actions.
      Scrat has a few special moves as well, such as sniff, his spin attack, a double jump, a ground stomp (useful for
      breaking ice) and a roll attack. Much of the game consists of hunting down acorns and other special nuts for
      health renewal or for unlocking bonuses. There are a few mini-games within the game - you can play as Sid, zipping
      along an ice slide while avoiding obstacles; there's also penguin-bowling and a mini-game where you "shoot" at
      monkeys to regain a walnut that was whisked out from under your nose.</story>

    <story>As with the 2004 edition, IHRA Professional Drag Racing 2005 is a simulation of drag racing. However, the
      2005 edition has been radically changed to be more accessible and is built on an entirely new code base. The
      controls have been modified and many functions have been automated. The graphics have also been improved, along
      with a new physics model.

      Included is an arcade mode, in both singleplayer and multiplayer, as well as a new simulation mode. In the

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      rise above the ranks to reach the mantle of Ikki Tousen which translates into one knight who is worthy of 1000

      Hakufu Sonsaku, Ryomou Shimei, Ryofu Housen, Kakouen Myosai, and Kanu Unchou. A new character named Chosen
      (Cicada) is also featured in the game who's a buxom blonde with red eyes, a snappy demeanor and a blue dress.
      The STORY MODE allows players to choose one character and live through her battlefield tribulations against the
      backdrop of original stories that were written exclusively for the game. The MISSION MODE features 50 stages of
      targeted objectives which mixes up the action. To add to the authenticity of the game, the voice actresses from
      the animation were hired to provide the utterances and battle cries of the combatants in the game. When fighting,
      the clothes of the girls may be shredded just like they are in the animation series. There's no outright nudity
      but skin is exposed that otherwise wouldn't get exposed. For example, when a girl's shirt is split near the bosom
      area, stringy threads will still keep it together.</story>

    <story>Indigo Prophecy (Fahrenheit in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control
      different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core
      gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and
      interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented
      sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require
      the player to press the correct button during a scene.

      The game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and
      cleaning the floor requires the player to move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual
      movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the
      optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice
      will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one
      of the three possible endings.</story>

      There are two modes present in the game. The "Arcade Mode", as its name suggests, is a direct port of the arcade
      game, where the player chooses a car from a list of Japan's most famous drift machines, and hits the streets
      challenging characters out of the manga. The objective here is to simply beat every one of the characters to
      become the number one driver. As players go along, they collect points, which can be used to upgrade the car.

      The second mode, "Story Mode", allows the player to control Takumi, the protagonist of the series. In this mode,
      there are a number of missions the player must complete. These missions are modeled after the events of the manga
      and anime series. Most of the missions involve racing characters from the manga, in the same order that Takumi
      raced them in the original work.</story>

      of the characters and tracks can only be unlocked as the game progresses.

      All of the runners will do just about anything to win, so the action can become down and dirty. Almost anything
      goes during the races including knocking opponents completely off the track with a well-placed kick, fist or
      weapon. Power-ups and booster items are scattered around the course for increasing performance, speed or providing
      a new method of attack. Strategy comes into play by knowing which character and which "pod" sidekick to choose.

      There are three modes of play: Single Race, Cup and Championship. Each offers unique environments, different
      obstacles and challenges.

      The Single Player game will put the player up against 5 CPU opponents. Multiplayer is offline and includes
      Deathmatch and Team modes (2 players on 2 teams) and up to 4 players in split screen.</story>

      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels

    <story>The creators of the beloved Crash Bandicoot series bring out a new duo of heroes for 3D platforming on the
      PS2 with this release of Naughty Dog's Jak and Daxter. While Jak is a handsome young hero with big blue eyes and
      bushy blond hair, his companion Daxter has been transformed into a small weasel-like creature by a strange dark
      curse. The two heroes set out to seek the forgotten secrets of the Precursors, an ancient race that inhabited the
      land many ages ago. Only by seeking the wisdom of the ancients can they hope to change Daxter back to his natural
      form.

      The game is designed to provide a large 3D world populated with towns, ruins, and diverse wilderness areas and it
      does not follow any strict level progression. The storyline is open-ended enough to allow Jak and Daxter to find
      their own way through the adventure, searching the land, accepting quests, and taking on powerful boss characters
      in the order the player chooses. By helping local inhabitants Jak and Daxter can earn power cells, which help to

      involves the player racing a jetski on various courses while maneuvering the vehicle around various obstacles.
      Unlike similar games like those in the Wave Race series, however, Jet X2O also places emphasis on performing
      tricks (which is a hallmark of many winter sports video games, including the SSX series). Despite the game's
      title, the game is not considered a spin-off of the Jet Moto series.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      Horse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world.
      There are three types: "flat" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses
      trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky. A major part of horse racing's

    <story>Jonny Moseley Mad Trix is an extreme skiing game, in the vein of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Dave Mirra
      Freestyle BMX.

      As Jonny Moseley, or a number of other real-life skiers, you must perform various stunts, of which there are
      hundreds, to attract the attention of movie studio's, ultimately to film you on runs.

      There are two modes of play; Slopestyle, where you can go down hills and perform stunts without any mission goals
      or other distractions, and Big Mountain, where you perform tricks to star in a ski movie.

      By performing good tricks, you will be able to see your run on the "big screen".

      In Big Mountain mode, you will ski down several real-life mountains, including Everest, Kilimanjaro, and the
      Alaskan mountains. In Slopestyle, head down fictional environments, like a snowed-in San Francisco, Washington
      D.C., and Las Vegas.</story>

      than 100 vehicles throughout their tumultuous stay. The main storyline includes over 20 missions with objectives
      that can be accomplished by any number of means. Hundreds of side and bonus missions are also available for fun or

      mosquito that must drain human blood to survive. This time, there's a choice between American and Japanese
      mosquitoes, each attacking a family of its nationality.

      The player controls the mosquito, flying around the room where the victim takes a rest. When approaching the
      human, the possible target areas on the body glow green. When the insect lands on those places, a small zoom
      screen shows the exposed skin and the mosquito ready to attack. Pressing the analog button makes the bug bite the
      victim, and moving the analog control fast starts the pumping action, where a syringe starts to slowly fill with
      blood. The danger of the human swatting the bug increases as the skin surrounding the bite gets more red.

      Sometimes the human gets up and starts to search for the mosquito. Green beams shine forth from the eyes, and the
      player must maneuver the insect out of its reach. When engaging in battle mode, the mosquito must bite certain
      body parts to decrease the human stress shown at the bottom of the screen.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      The Smart Brain corporation, the world's most powerful corporation, is trying to take over the world using
      Orphnoch, the "next stage in humanity's evolution", to covertly kill off the human population. In pursuit of this,
      they develop three suits of power armor, called Rider Gears (each for Delta, Faiz, and Kaixa), to find and protect
      the Orphnoch King, who can fix a defect within Orphnoch DNA which causes their genetic structure to break down,
      leading to death.
      The Rider Gears are stolen by Hanagata, the Goat Orphnoch and former chief of Smart Brain. He sends them to his
      foster children (dubbed the "Ryuseiji", after the school they attended) so they can stop the Orphnoch from
      achieving their goal. However, Rider Gears were designed to be worn by Orphnoch, and humans are unable to activate
      the systems without undergoing genetic modification.</story>

    <story>Karaoke Revolution allows PlayStation 2 gamers to show off their singing skills and get real-time feedback on
      their performances. It's similar to Dance Dance Revolution, but with singing instead of dancing.

      Players sing using the Logitech PS2 Headset (or other approved PlayStation 2 USB microphone devices). The game
      rates the player's performance based on their vocal pitch and timing. A visual indicator shows the player's
      current pitch in real time and also the pitch of vocals of the original song. If the original notes of the song
      are too high for the player's vocal range, the game allows the player to sing at higher or lower octaves to hit
      the correct notes.</story>

    <story>Snow &amp; Party is a compilation of 50 J-Pop winter holidays themed songs. The gameplay remains unchanged to
      J-Pop Best series and even the same gameplay modes are supported. Same as other Karaoke Revolution games, this
      basically brings you a karaoke at home which can be played by using either a USB microphone or a USB headset.

      The game offers several different gameplay modes such as Revolution and Stage Challenge where you need to sing as
      is supposed to in order to avoid game over screen, Team Battle which lets 4, 6, or 8 players go in 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3,
      or 4 vs 4 battles by naming their groups, selecting and naming their characters and pick to songs to try on
      against each other, and Audition mode which is a story mode which plays as a short visual novel in between
      singing, where the player selects one of the four characters trying to enter the music company by auditioning.

    <story>The King of All Cosmos accidentally destroyed the stars andâ€”having recoveredâ€”wants the prince to rebuild
      them. Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require
      some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to â€œroll upâ€ items increasing
      the Katamariâ€™s size until itâ€™s suitable for the King.

      Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around
      collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari
      grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll
      over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and
      other bigger items.

      Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage
      takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese
      girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamariâ€™s size
      and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.

      The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find
      presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in
      a Katamari competition.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>In the original Kenka Banchou game from 2005, a pompadour-wearing hero named Yasuo battled rival hoodlums for
      renown and established a bad-ass repute at the expense of society at large. Despite Yasuo's thuggish leanings, he
      wasn't above helping grannies and other citizens with mundane tasks and errands. Yasuo exhibited a deep and
      resonant duality in that way. Spike went on to sell 157,000 copies of the game without much of an advertising
      budget or any name recognition.
      Fast forward two years and Yasuo's still around but no longer the hero. A young buck named Tomoya has entered the
      world and must earn his own badge of yankii honor. By using the mighty menchi beam to initiate encounters and
      fists to beat down packs of ruffians, the new protagonist slowly gains street cred, repute, and the adoration of
      lowly gangsters throughout the hood.
      Even though Yasuo sort of looked like Fonzie, he never had a motorcycle in the original game. Tomoya gets one
      immediately during the introductory training session of the game where certain actions are completed. When the
      game proper starts, Tomoya may pedal around on a bicycle but he'll eventually graduate to the throaty rumbles of
      his own motorcycle and raise hell by tearing through the streets.</story>

      Electronic Arts for the PlayStation 2.
      Kessen is the story of two warring clans waging war against each other for control of the entire land, during 15th

    <story>It is a time of war. Many leaders from different factions fight to control their land. One such leader, Liu
      Bei, has only one wish: peace. But war stands in his way, after his land Shu is attacked by the kingdom of Wei,
      led by the warlord Cao Cao, who abducts Liu Bei's beloved Diao Chan, the keeper of the Imperial Seal. Liu Bei has
      to flee, but swears to return, exact revenge on Cao Cao, and liberate the kingdom of Shu.

      Kessen II is a real-time strategy game, and a follow-up to Kessen. Unlike the first game, it is set in the Chinese
      Three Kingdoms period. The account of historical events is heavily fictionalized in the game, liberally adding new
      sub-plots (such as the entire romance angle of the story) and supernatural elements. The player can choose to
      command the armies of either Liu Bei or Cao Cao in their respective scenarios.

      The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, the most notable change being the shift to supernatural
      warfare, including the addition of magical attacks such as tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, meteor
      showers, etc. The player can now control 500 units at one time, as opposed to 100 in the previous game. New unit
      types (elite horsemen, elephant cavalry, etc.) have been added.</story>

      Following the prequels, this game comes with lots of cinematics and stays true to strategic as well as action

      including Nobunaga, will have his/her army at their disposal which can be controlled at any point. Level-ups bring
      additional special attacks to both officers and their troops.</story>

    <story>Mobile Suit Gundam follows the exploits of Amuro Ray and his friends and colleagues aboard the White Base, a
      flying fortress that serves as their home, as they engage in various missions against the Principality of Zeon.
      Half a century has passed since the world's population began migrating to massive orbiting space colonies. All is
      not well, however, as a group of colonies furthest from the planet proclaims itself the Principality of Zeon and
      declares war on Earth.
      Half of the warring factions' populations have been destroyed and there appears to be no end in sight to this war
      between the Earth Federation and the Principality. An innocent civilian by the name of Amuro Ray is drawn into the
      conflict, and it's this young man, more specifically, his Gundam, that players control. Based upon the anime,
      gameplay in Mobile Suit Gundam is reminiscent of Armored Core 2, requiring players to pilot the robot-like Gundam
      through a number of missions ranging from guerilla attacks on enemy installations to defending a base against an
      onslaught of invaders.</story>

      Basically you are some sort of enhanced soldier with no memory of who or where you came from. The story unfolds
      over the course of fifteen missions, spanning 5 levels, and through FMV cinematics.

      At first you'll cause all sorts of mayhem in various global hotspots, but as the past is made clear, the real

      world peace, however, is marred by continuous attacks carried out by a new terrorist group called "Heaven Smile",
      which consists of human mutants under the influence of a lethal virus, and targets the United Nations and the

      as the latter becomes controlled by a party that proposes to sever connections to the USA.


      A group of assassins known as Killer7 is hired by a man named Christopher Mills, on behalf of the US government.
      The group is led by an elderly wheelchair-bound man named Harman Smith, endowed with an ability known as
      "Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon", which allows him to transform into seven different personalities who were

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>An original title from Sony Computer Entertainment, Kinetica is a high-speed futuristic racer akin to the
      likes of XG3 Extreme G Racing. In stark contrast to more conventional forms of racing, the racers in Kinetica wear
      futuristic suits with wheels attached to their hands and feet. As a result, the racers themselves become the
      vehicles. Far from a mere cosmetic choice, these suits play an integral part of the gameplay. Free from the
      hulking vehicles found in similar games, these racers can move their limbs independently, and as such, can perform
      a host of tricks and stunts. Players are required to execute these stunts by performing a combination of
      directional movements while holding the R1 button down. Correctly executing tricks fills a boost meter, which,
      once completed, provides the character with a limited speed boost.
      The racers themselves come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and include both male and female competitors. During
      a race, competitors are randomly awarded power-ups, with a range of uses. Tracks are scattered across a handful of
      environments, dropping racers into inhospitable alien worlds, caverns, and the requisite futuristic cities.
      Shortcuts, jumps, and tight turns prevail throughout the tracks, requiring players to master a variety of handling
      techniques.</story>

    <story>King of Clubs is a crazy golf game set in Big Bubba’s run down theme park in the middle of the Nevada desert.
      It features 96 holes, set in 5 different environment themes. Each environment theme has its own resident ‘Course
      Pro’ resplendent in suitably themed fancy dress costume.

      There are 4 single player modes (Career, Tournament, Speed Golf, Practice). As you progress through the game,
      you’ll unlock special balls and clubs which enable you to play different types of shots (e.g. chip clubs, swerve
      clubs, rubber balls, speed balls). Combinations of these balls and clubs then allow you to approach holes in
      different ways and attempt various trick shots to try and get a hole in one (which is possible on every hole).

      In multi-player, you can play against up to 3 friends. The multi-player game features specific pickups which can
      help you &amp; hinder your opponents as well as a ‘distraction’ feature which allows non-active players to trigger
      sound effects &amp; rumble the pad of the player currently taking a shot.

      The game also features a ‘Pro-Shop’ where buy various gadgets to customise various elements of the game such as
      the colour of your ball, its trail and even the sound effects it makes when you hit it.</story>

    <story>Kinnikuman is a manga created by the duo of Yudetamago, which is composed of Yoshinori Nakai and Takashi
      Shimada. The manga was published in Shueisha's Weekly Jump, and received the Shogakukan Manga Award for children's
      manga in 1985. An animated series was produced using the Limited animation technique.
      The story involves Kinnikuman (his real name is Suguru Kinniku), a clumsy fool of a superhero, finding out he is
      the missing prince of the planet Kinniku, known for turning out the greatest superheroes in the universe. Being a
      clumsy fool, however, he must prove himself worthy of the throne. To do so, he enters into wrestling competitions
      and battles evil Chojin, ultimately culminating in a tournament between Kinnikuman and five pretenders to the
      throne (Kinnikuman Big Body, Soldier, Zebra, Mariposa, and Super Phoenix). Many of Kinnikuman's allies begin as
      villains (Ramenman, Buffalo Man, Ashuraman, Warsman), and extremely arrogant heroes (Terryman, Robin Mask,
      Rikishiman).</story>

    <story>Kirikou and the Wild Beasts (French: Kirikou et les b?tes sauvages) is a 2005 French animated feature film.
      It premiered at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival on 13 May and, unlike its predecessor, received only festival
      screenings in all English-speaking territories. It was released on English-subtitled DVD-Video in the United
      States by KimStim (distributed by Kino International) on 29 July 2008 as Kirikou and the Wild Beast.
      The film is a sub-story to Kirikou and the Sorceress rather than a straight sequel. The movie is set while Kirikou
      is still a child and Karaba is still a sorceress. Like Princes et princesses and Les Contes de la nuit, it is an
      anthology film comprising several episodic stories, each of them describing Kirikou's interactions with a
      different animals. It is however unique among Michel Ocelot's films, not only in that it is co-directed by
      B?n?dicte Galup (who has previously worked with him as an animator) but also for each of the stories being written
      by a different person (in all other cases, Ocelot has been the sole writer and director of his films).</story>

      Kono Aozora ni Yakusoku o's gameplay requires minimal interaction on the player's part as much of the time that is
      spent on the game is for reading the text that is displayed at the bottom of the screen. The displayed text
      represents either the thoughts of the characters or the dialogue between the characters. As the story progresses,

      failure resulting in immediate expulsion. The tasks will usually be of a mundane nature, but will inevitably end

      As a rift reopens between this world and the realms of evil, the svelte and stealthy Hibana must battle demons

      mystic arts, making her the last, best hope to keep the city safe and the evil contained.
      While Nightshade's gameplay is similar to that of Sega's 2002 version of Shinobi (also developed by OverWorks),

    <story>Aimed at grown-up gamers who aren't easily spooked (but who like to be), Kuon is a horror adventure set in
      Japan toward the end of the Heian period (approximately 800 C.E. to 1200 C.E.). A castle in the capital of Kyoto
      is overrun with unholy zombie-like beings. Gamers can play as an exorcist named Doman, who goes to explore the
      strange happenings at the castle, or as Doman's daughter, Utuski, who enters the castle to look for her father.
      Completing the game with both characters opens up an additional, final chapter in the story, through which gamers
      play as a third, unlockable character.
      The whole game revolves around the strange events at a medieval Japanese manor and the nearby shrine. Yin Phase
      revolves around a sheltered girl named Utsuki. Her father is a civilian exorcist who has been summoned to
      investigate the manor. When he does not return, she and her sister travel to the manor in search of him. At the
      manor, eerie hymns put her sister into a trance, and she vanishes into the gloom. Utsuki must now find both her

      arrived in. This strange world consists of various floating islands with many tunnels, platforms, dangerous life
      forms, and other obstacles. Powerful winds blow around many areas, and you'll often need to use the winds to your
      advantage by floating in them through tunnels, over gaps or slowing your descent in a free fall. There is some
      puzzle solving as well; you'll need to locate objects to use, hop on various platforms, buy items in the Nativ
      city, and more to reach new areas.

      You'll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get
      through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or
      boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to
      its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will
      then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help
      on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop. You
      can earn money by betting and completing challenge objectives (or you can simply practice a challenge).

      As you progress through the game, the story will unfold until you are (hopefully) successful in your quest!

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels or tableau vivant stage plays.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a remake of the original Tomb Raider. The remake has the same basic
      storyline, locations, and core gameplay; however, it has a technically more advanced graphics engine and adds
      several new features that were introduced in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend. Lara has many new moves, such as
      swinging on ropes, bullet time when an animal rushes towards her, and the addition of a grappling hook in her
      inventory (which resembles the one from the original game). Jumping is also a lot easier, as the heroine
      automatically grabs the ledges without requiring pixel-precise timing. There are also completely new moves, where
      Lara balances and jumps on small sticks.

      The cutscenes are identical, but rendered in real-time using the new engine. Some are also action-based, like in
      the previous games, requiring quick reflexes to keep the action going. The environments and puzzles have been
      somewhat changed to fit the new gameplay, and the voice recording was also redone.</story>

    <story>Indeed a legend in her own time, Lara Croft returns to consoles in 2006 with a new look, a new game, and a
      new developer. Revamped physics and an enhanced control scheme allow for more free-flowing action, while graphical
      improvements present a redesigned Lara who is immediately expressive, more believably proportioned, and as

      Lady Croft's new look in Legend is based in part on 20-year-old British model Karima Adebibe. Lara now boasts
      smoother animations, a more realistic deportment, and a number of costume changes. The original Tomb Raider games
      were popular for their innovative blend of gaming styles as well as for their distinguished female lead, however,
      and this game is designed to return fans to the winning combination of 3D platforming, environmental

      as well, as she's now rendered with ten times the number of polygons as in earlier Tomb Raider games.
      The role-playing aspects of this adventure are slightly more central to play than in earlier games. Lara must
      enter a dark, supernatural world where nothing is certain. She must interact with other characters, and complex
      situations call for her to make ethical decisions where there is no clear-cut "good" or "evil" choice. Lara also
      develops throughout the game, as her abilities improve and adapt to the way she's played. A new system is designed
      to offer smoother control of Lara's many moves, which include new stealth attacks and hand-to-hand combat.</story>

      village of Nohl is a refuge for Mystics; one of them is a young swordsman named Lang, whose duty is to protect a
      crystal that supplies the town with water. One day, Lang meets a mysterious man who manipulates him into giving up
      the crystal. Determined to correct his mistake, Lang sets on a journey to retrieve the crystal, on which he will
      learn more of the role the Mystics and their Origins play in the world.

      Legaia 2: Duel Saga is a follow-up to Legend of Legaia, though it is not directly connected to it story-wise,
      featuring a different cast of characters. Like its predecessor, it is a Japanese-style role-playing game with
      turn-based combat. The game utilizes a system called "Arts", which requires the player to press a combination of
      buttons corresponding to fighting moves during battles. These are divided into the sub-categories "Normal Arts"
      (basic moves), "Hyper Arts" (more powerful moves that require special points to be spent), "Mystic Arts" (Origin
      powers), and, finally, "Variable Arts" (team attacks).

      The game also features a Camping mode; accessing it, the player is able to communicate with the characters in the
      party, prepare meals from ingredients, and craft items such as weapons, armor, and accessories.</story>

    <story>The Legend of Alon D'ar is an role-playing video game for the PlayStation 2 console.

      Gameplay[edit]
      The game plays somewhat like the Final Fantasy series' Active Time Battle, with the player having to wait certain
      time for their turn. What makes this system different from ATB is that actions take different amounts of time
      based on the weapon or ability used, for example an axe will need more time than a dagger to attack.

      The game features a vast world to explore; there are several towns and a variety of monsters to combat. The game
      also features multi-player experience after unlocking the second character in the story.</story>

      The young hero "Kay", a cat, rise to a challenge when emperor Shun - king of the mighty gorilla - invaded the
      island Yenching with his troops. Kay may be only a scholar, but he is a brave and agile fighter. He leaves his
      village only with his sword and soon becomes a seasoned fighter.

      The fights in Legend of Kay reminds of good old eastern martial-arts-movies. There are various moves the player
      can execute: uppercuts, back flips, somersaults, powerful magic attacks and you have the combo moves. When you
      gain a combo, you can auto aim at enemies, which makes it easy for the player to execute double- and triple blows.

      In the beginning you only have a sword but later in the game Kay receives steel claws and a powerful war hammer.
      All weapons can be upgraded.

      Kay has to fight against a lot of different enemies on ground and in the air. There are a lot of jump and run

      titles, Lilie was exclusively released in Japan.
      Despite being the last game in the trilogy, Atelier Lilie takes place before it's predecessors. The game's setting
      is still in Salburg, but is twenty years prior to Atelier Marie: The Alchemist of Salburg and over twenty-five
      years to Atelier Elie: The Alchemist of Salburg 2. The game introduces a few new characters to the series, but
      also features younger versions of characters from previous Salburg games.
      The original release of Atelier Lilie was on June 21st, 2001, and the Plus version was released in April of 2002.
      Both versions were released on the Playstation 2, and unlike previous titles, Atelier Lilie didn't see
      collaborations with other major titles.
      The game's main protagonist Lilie is featured in one of the Atelier side games Hermina and Culus: Atelier Lilie

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      It features three game modes (single race, time trial and challenge) and three difficulty levels (beginner,

      the start : for example only the four first characters can be chosen when you first start a game : Mr Mouse, Mr
      Hamster, Mr Rat and Mr Guinea Pig. Other characters, boats, tracks and race classes become available after
      collecting a number of stars.

      The other power-ups are extra lives, power boosts and nutritious items, such as red donuts, green puffs or yellow
      triangles. Do not forget to "drive" over speed stripes to boost your boat, but also collect weapons. These are
      carrot missiles and pumpkin bombs. But if you use an invincibility shield, no one can use these weapons against
      you.

      From the option menu, you can set up sound and music, but also controls and use 8 save slots. As a side feature of

      in the streets of London and Edinburgh, with additional tracks in Las Vegas, New York and Chicago.

      There are three single player modes available: Single Race, Tournament and Time Trial. In Single Race the player
      is free to choose any of the 6 characters available, any of the tracks and any of the unlocked cars. In Tournament
      mode, the player races in a series of tracks while collecting money prizes and unlocking new cars. In both modes,
      players race against other races while avoiding being catch by the police. The Time Trial mode, players race
      against the clock trying to beat the best time for each track.

      Each car (driven by a different character) has different stats in acceleration, top speed, handling, breaking and
      strength. The cars can also be upgraded using money collected from winning races and collecting money tokens
      during races. The cars also take damage when hit and can break into total loss if the damage bar is full. Repair
      tokens can be collected during races and if a car finishes a race damaged it can be repaired before the next one
      using money. Nitro tokens can also be collected and bought, and the cars' colors can be changed.

      There are also two split-screen two player modes: Duel and Cop vs. Driver. In the Duel mode, players race against
      each other in any given track. In Cop vs. Driver, one player is the cop and the other a regular racer, and the cop
      player must try to crash the driver within the time limit.

      The game can be played from either first (hood camera) or third person (behind the car) perspective.

    <story>Gamers pick up their controllers and attempt to defeat the evil Mad Scientist and his plans of extinction in
      Looney Tunes ACME Arsenal. The Looney Tunes characters are in trouble. Mad Scientist created a time machine, and
      is traveling through the years with an eraser to remove them from history. Single-player or cooperative gamers
      must stop Mad Scientist by leading seven characters against legions of robots and Martians as they travel through
      time.
      Players may master the special weapons of Foghorn Leghorn, Marvin the Martian, Gossamer, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck,
      the Tazmanian Devil, and one secret unlockable character, as they work their way through several levels of puzzle,
      combat, and vehicular action. The environments and content of the game is based on a handful of classic cartoons
      starring each of the playable characters.
      Players travel through the Wild West, Camelot, Ancient Egypt, and Mars as they stop Mad Scientist from ruining
      their world. Gamers may use their main weapon during the game or switch to items obtained in each level, and
      Eludium rods found around the game affect such weapons as Bugs Bunny's banjo.</story>

    <story>First released on the Dreamcast in 2000, Space Race brings wacky Looney Tunes-inspired kart-racing mayhem to
      the PlayStation 2. Updated for its PS2 debut, the title plays host to among other things, an exclusive gameplay
      mode, entitled Tournament. This mode places competitors in a series of races with the sole purpose of acquiring
      positioning points. The character with the most points after the gamut of courses is declared the winner and
      awarded tokens, which in turn can be used to unlock hidden items, such as character art and even a Looney Tunes
      movie. Incidentally, tokens are the pervading requirement across many of the game's modes, and are also awarded
      for outstanding achievements in the Race, Time Trial, and Challenge modes. The bulk of the gameplay is to be found
      in the Race mode, where players can choose their racer and track. By winning races in this mode you'll be able to
      unlock additional courses, ranging from Planet ACME to the Wild West Quadrant.

      Set in the well-loved Warner Bros. universe, the title offers a plethora of recognizable characters to choose
      from, including Yosemite Sam, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Wile E. Coyote, and Elmer Fudd, each of whom
      races aboard a custom hoverjet that reflects his individual style and personality. During the course of a race,
      players can make use of a wide variety of ACME products to hinder the progress of their rivals, including portable
      holes, instant storms, a boxing glove, and kablooey rockets. By collecting the requisite number of fuel cans
      scattered around each track, racers can initiate a temporary turbo boost.</story>

      popular anime (which is itself based on early-20th century stories by French author Maurice Leblanc), this game
      puts players in control of Lupin, grandson of the world's most celebrated gentleman thief, who is joined by his
      constant companions Jigen the sharpshooter, Goemon the rogue samurai, and his dangerously alluring love-interest
      Fujiko. Lupin's nemesis Zenigata is also featured, so it's a safe bet the police inspector will almost nab the
      playboy thief at least once or twice before this adventure is finished.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). In Japanese terminology, a distinction is
      often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist predominantly of narration and have very
      few interactive elements.
      Visual novels are distinguished from other game types by their extremely minimal gameplay. Typically the majority
      of player interaction is limited to clicking to keep the text, graphics and sound moving (most recent games offer
      "play" or "fast-forward" toggles that make even this unnecessary).
      Lucian Bee's - Evil Violet: In the original game, the protagonist is part of Strike, one of the units in a secret
      organisation that transforms ?dame otoko? aka messed up guys into good looking guys. They are given the task to
      sort out a new boy band Romanxia. We have six guys in the band, each one of them very unique and belonging to a
      different nationality. There was 2 fandisks for the series has A either get together with the Metropolis V members
      in Justice Yellow, or the Honeybuzzard VI members at Daresign in Evil Violet. It?s basically all choice-based and

      Finally, conductors whittle away the hours by practicing and rehearsing their groups for performances worthy of
      encore level bravissimo. On-screen cues help aspiring musical directors conduct and create some beautiful music.

    <story>Mafia is set in the 1930s, between the fall of 1930 through to the end of 1938, during the later part of
      Prohibition, which ended in 1933. The game is set in the fictional American city of Lost Heaven (loosely based on
      New York City and Chicago of the same time period).

      The player takes the role of taxi driver Thomas "Tommy" Angelo, who, while trying to make a living on the streets
      of Lost Heaven, unexpectedly and unwillingly becomes involved in organized crime as a driver and enforcer for the
      Salieri crime family, led by Don Ennio Salieri.

      Through the events of the game's story, Tommy begins to rise through the ranks of the Salieri family, which is
      currently battling the competing Morello family, led by the sharply-dressed Don Morello. Eventually becoming
      disillusioned by his life of crime and violence, Tommy arranges to meet a detective (Detective Norman) in order to
      tell him his story, to be given witness protection, and to aid the detective in the destruction of the Salieri
      crime family. The 'Intermezzo' chapters of the game depict Tommy sitting in a cafe with the detective, relating

      created. With the help of Zoe and Taro, the character trains and battles using custom-created designs, which can
      be traded to or battled with the creations of other players. As the Doodles battle, they become more powerful, and
      earn points towards the purchase of pre-created Doodles, and extra abilities towards customizable creation. Combat
      functions according to three selections: attack, magic, and block, as well as a charge command. The three basic
      maneuvers follow a standard rock-paper-scissors methodology, but repetitiveness is minimized due to the varied
      attributes of the Doodles, as well as the inability to successively repeat any selection.</story>

      30, 2006. The adventure game is set in the Kazehana Gakuen, which is protected by the "Hime" of the title. The
      Tree of Fate in the title points to the fact that the game provides a different view and perspective in the
      Mai-Hime world than that of the anime series. Character designs are not the same as the ones in the anime series.

      However, My Otome HIME is not a true fighting game in the classic sense of the genre. When NCS thinks of fighting,

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>Makai Kingdom is the fourth Nippon Ichi-developed tactical RPG on PlayStation 2 and it follows closely in the
      footsteps of the previous games of the same style, which are Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, La Pucelle: Tactics and
      Phantom Brave.

      Lord Zetta, the king of Netherworld, tried to rewrite the history of the land but didn't succeed, and in the
      process brought demise onto himself. Three evil Overlords appeared before Zetta and promised to help him in his
      quest to take over the land once more. The player takes control of Zetta and his army to return Netherworld to its
      rightful owner.

      The game mechanics consist of several stages in which the player must defeat the enemy or fulfill other tasks to
      advance to the next level. Fighting is done in turns, meaning that once the player has moved and attacked, it's
      the enemy's turn to move his troops one by one. When the battle is won, the next level becomes selectable. Between
      fights, you can improve your squad of fighters by buying better weapons, recruiting more soldiers and so on.

      in the middle of a civil war over who takes the throne. Not willing to give up his rightful place as the next
      king, Laharl joins with his subordinate Etna and her underlings to fight back.

      Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The
      player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do
      combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal
      damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the
      player's units are destroyed.

      Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or
      force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the
      base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy
      in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters
      inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</story>

      father when they find him.

      The game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining
      character levels, and can level up those abilities through use. New items and equipment can be bought or won in
      battle, and can be powered up up by entering and winning battles inside a given item. Characters can also "gang
      up" on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking
      character. This action only uses the attacking character's turn, leaving the others free to attack again. Clever
      coordination can have characters attacking quite a few times per turn. New characters can be created (or even
      reborn as other classes or just more powerful versions of the same class) by petitioning (or even bribing with
      special items) the Dark Assembly with "Mana" you earn by defeating enemies.</story>

    <story>Marl de Jigsaw is an action jigsaw puzzle spinoff of the Marl Kingdom series. It plays much like the other
      jigsaw games from Nippon Ichi, modifying the traditionally-leisurely game for competitive play. All of the
      characters and illustrations are from the first two Marl Kingdom games.
      Each player is given only four pieces at any time, and must complete the puzzle by placing pieces into the correct
      places as quickly as possible. The first player to complete three puzzles is declared the winner. Rapidly placing
      the correct pieces will fill a meter which allows four different types of special moves to hinder the opponent,
      such as by removing solved pieces or obscuring the available pieces. Each of the more than two-dozen characters
      have their own set of moves available.</story>

    <story>Capcom's three-on-three arcade game, featuring popular characters from previous action, shooting, and
      fighting titles, comes to the PS2 with this release of Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Over 50 characters are available to
      fight as or against, two-dozen of which are initially playable. Each combatant offers a variety of aerial
      maneuvers, special attacks, and projectile blasts as players attempt to defeat their opponent's team.
      Rather than having all three characters fight on the screen at once, players swap fighters in and out of the match
      at any time, even for a single attack on an opponent. The remaining two characters rest on the sidelines until
      called upon to assist. In addition to a health bar, each fighter has a separate meter used for Hyper Combo attacks
      that can be powered-up to five increasingly destructive levels.
      Besides directly switching characters during a fight, players can press one of two assist buttons to have one of
      their teammates perform a pre-selected attack or defensive maneuver. If an opponent has unleashed an aerial
      attack, for example, pressing the assist button might have the second or third character enter the screen to
      perform an anti-air maneuver, thus leaving the primary fighter free from harm.</story>

      different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones).

      The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold
      challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven
      (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles
      where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really
      like you.

      To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can
      pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers
      out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to
      make sure they can't use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is
      just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very

      powerful, recurring characters that represent the most ruthless officers to ever serve in Hitler's armed forces.

    <story>In Frontline, the player takes on a first person view and fights as an American OSS operative in D-Day. There
      are six missions in Frontline, each made up of several smaller levels. Briefings take place at the start of each
      mission, which advance the plot and introduce new characters. The smaller missions take place in a linear path,
      with the player fighting through towns and countryside, killing enemies and completing objectives. Objectives are
      explained to the character in a smaller briefing before each level, which prepares the player for that particular
      mission. The "War Room" serves as the game's main menu, and is reminiscent of Britain's secret underground
      intelligence bunkers during WWII.</story>

      planes. A few minutes later, he is blown from the ship and lands in the water, where a PT boat carrying Jack
      'Gunny' Lawton, Frank Spinneli, and Silas Whitfield. Joe then shoots down more planes and also aids the USS Nevada
      (BB-36) to escape the harbor. Joe is then sent to the Philippines to destroy a bridge, and he meets his brother
      Donnie. Donnie is unable to escape the islands because his tank was overwhelmed by Japanese troops, forcing Joe to
      leave without him. Joe then goes to Guadalcanal at night to take over an airbase. Days later, the airfield is
      still taking heavy artillery fire, so Gunny assigns Joe and two other marines to destroy the artillery nicknamed
      'Pistol Pete'. On the way Joe meets Edmund Harrison, a demolitions expert, and the real life Scottish guerilla
      fighter Martin Clemens. After this mission, Joe is promoted to Sergeant and recruited into the Office of Strategic

    <story>The plot of Mega Man X7 takes place in the 22nd century during an age when humans coexist with humanoid
      robots called "Reploids". As some Reploids participate in violent and destructive crime, a police organization
      called the "Maverick Hunters" was established to stamp out this activity. As the Reploid conflicts proceed after
      the Nightmare phenomena event of Mega Man X6, the world is slowly recovering. But as always, Maverick crime is
      rising in newly constructed cities. As this new crime wave hits, X finds himself trying to answer moral questions
      that have plagued him since he joined the Maverick Hunters: "Are we doing the right thing to solve this matter?",
      leading him to the decision of "I've had enough of this violence." Unable to assuage his conscience, he drops from
      the battle frontlines and assumes a more strategic support role at headquarters. With X's retirement, a massive
      power vacuum ensues and many independent groups develop, trying to fill the void left by the hunter. Prominent
      among these groups is the "Red Alert Syndicate", growing large enough to become a dominant force. The Red Alert is
      a new group of Reploids, similar to the Repliforce, but consisting of vigilantes. They claim to hunt Mavericks,
      but apparently do more than that. One of their members, Axl, decides he's had enough of their "murdering" and
      tries to leave the group. Red, the group's leader, is angered by Axl deserting, and goes on a rampage to get Axl

    <story>Like its immediate predecessor, Megaman X8 presents its 2D-style platform-shooter action in a 3D game world.
      Mega Man X is joined in this adventure by two close associates, Zero and Axle, and each character has different
      strengths and abilities. Players can switch between two characters in the heat of battle, to solve a platform
      puzzle or fend of a particular enemy type, and the two characters not controlled by the player will try to help
      out in combat if the leading character becomes overwhelmed.
      Characters not controlled by the player recover more quickly when the hero onscreen is performing well. As in most
      games in the long-running Mega Man series, defeating a boss character earns the ability to use its special weapon.
      Other defeated enemies may leave behind metal bits, which can be collected and used to create custom power-ups. In
      addition to the side-scrolling platform levels, some boss fights and other events are played from alternate

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels

      these being the main focus of the title. As either agent, players must hunt down rogue aliens, such as Corn Face

      Maximus Securitus itself, all while facing off against hordes of Drepp, Blue Rakoss, Black Rottermite, and other

      Rather than overlooking the environment, the player controls a character from a thirdperson perspective. Walking

    <story>The player's job is to create and maintain a city. Played from a thirdperson perspective, the player needs to
      walk around, construct buildings, provide roads, and then screen the emails of possible inhabitants. Citizens need
      to be kept happy by interacting with them - give them gifts, listen to their gossip and complaints. If their needs
      are attended to (through schools, hospitals or entertainment), they will ditch the town. Build commercial,
      utility, entertainment industries to appease your citizens and make this a city people want to live in.</story>

    <story>Based on the 80's TV series of the same name, this is a 3rd person shooter. Playing as Sonny Crockett or
      Ricardo Tubbs, the player must dismantle drug-lord Ortega's organization, following the plot of an episode of the
      series.
      Through 14 missions, the player must take down (or arrest, sometimes) drug dealers and solve some minor puzzles
      (like finding keys to open doors, or switching levers to get access to locked places). In some stages, the player
      can choose freely to play as Crockett or Tubbs, switching between them by the click of a button. They have
      different abilities (Tubbs, for instance, is tougher and can kick in doors, Crockett is more agile), and different
      weapons (Crockett has a pistol as primary weapon, Tubbs has a double barreled shotgun). The characters can also
      carry a secondary weapon, from among 14 types (9mm pistols, .45 pistols, silenced 9mm, Uzi-like sub-machineguns,
      etc.). Each character can use only certain types of weapon, Tubbs carrying usually the heavier ones. The primary
      weapons have unlimited ammo, the secondary ones don't.</story>

    <story>Michigan: Report from Hell, released as Michigan in Japan, is a survival horror game developed by Grasshopper
      Manufacture and published by Spike. Directed by Akira Ueda, and planned by Goichi Suda the game focuses on a news
      crew for the fictional Zaka TV, dedicated to covering strange phenomena. The game is unique in the sense that it
      is played almost entirely though the viewfinder of a camera; and the game is lost if the player runs out of film
      before solving the mysteries in a mission.
      Although the word Michigan by itself usually refers to the State of Michigan or less commonly the University of
      Michigan, the game takes place in Chicago, Illinois, and is named because the game's phenomena centers around Lake
      Michigan.</story>

    <story>In this 3D remake of the original miniature racing game, players can compete on 24 different race tracks with
      48 vehicles including toy cars, motorcycles, boats and more, using one of 8 difference characters. As in the

      Each track features unique terrain with ramps, tunnels, obstacles and hazards. Hidden weapons and power-ups let
      drivers use rockets, time warps, mines, giant frying pans and fireballs against each other to take the lead.
      There are several different racing modes. In GP mode the player must reach each checkpoint within a set time
      limit, while Bomb Tag involves drivers being threatened with exploding unless they can hit another car in order to
      'tag' the bomb onto it. In the main Championship there are four cups, each featuring four races.</story>

    <story>After over 9 years of waiting, Micro Machines V4 is the first true new game in the Micro Machines series and
      the direct successor to Micro Machines V3.

      Just like in Mad Tracks you drive little toy cars through 50 miniature-size all-day environments like over a pool
      table or through the eaves gutters of a house. On the tracks you can find weapons (e.g. a flamethrower, a
      monster-hammer or rockets) and power-ups that help you win the race. If you win a race you'll get money which you
      need to unlock new tracks and cars.

      In multiplayer mode up to 4 players can race against each other either on one PC or online. The PS2 version offers
      multiplayer with multitap and with the PSP version, you can play on one device (two players) or through WiFi (four
      players). Playing online also features a new twist in the races. If you want to, you can bet your car and if you
      lose your opponent gets it. You can also trade cars from your collection with others.

      An editor to design your own tracks is included in the package. Extra tracks can be unlocked by connecting the PSP
      to the PS2.</story>

      There are many types of pachinko machines and parlor regulations, but most of them conform to a similar style of
      play. Players can buy metal balls by either inserting either cash, a pre-paid card, or their member's card
      directly into the machine they want to use. At 4 yen per ball that's 250 balls for every 1000 yen. These balls are
      then shot into the machine from a ball tray with the purpose of attempting to win more balls. The pachinko machine
      has a digital slot machine on a large screen in the center of its layout, and the objective here is to get 3

      A favorite feature from the PlayStation's original Hot Shots Golf returns in this version: the ability to play 18
      holes of carom-friendly miniature golf. Hot Shots Golf Fore! is also the first in the series to offer online play.

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      awaited her was odd incidents and someone suddenly targeting her life. Katase? Ichiyou? The clan of Kusou?
      Suddenly Hina is forced to face facts she may have never wanted to deal with, when the coincidence of it always
      raining whenever she felt sad or depressed turns out to be not as un-related to her.</story>

    <story>In MLB 06: The Show you can manage players, their salaries, keep up to date with the business of the team,
      check on the players team morale and keep them happy to keep your team in contention. Control everything of your
      business even to the prices of the tickets to even the prices of the vendors.

      It has a career mode where you can create yourself by using the game controls or by using EyeToy to paste your
      face on. You can keep tabs on yourself in career mode as and control which teams you want play for, but you have
      to earn you right to compete in the big leagues by battling your way up from the minor leagues. Keep track of your
      achievements as you progress and if you choose, you can even skip parts of the game to your at bats or pitching
      appearances, making the game much more streamlined and very personal.

      The players act very realistic due to the fact they used motion capturing for almost every major player, giving it
      untolds amounts of realistic animation and almost giving them real emotions, such as if a pitcher gives up a big
      home run, you can see the disappointed on his face or if you hit a game winning home run your entire team goes
      nuts celebrating.

      The game also comes with a fun set of mini games including the classic Home Run Derby and a new King of the
      Diamond, which has multiple levels, a timer and is constantly adapting to keep you guessing. The rosters even were
      up to date at the time, actually having the 2006 rosters instead of the previous year.</story>

      Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking
      the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other
      brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low.

      flying fortress that serves as their home, as they engage in various missions against the Principality of Zeon.
      Half a century has passed since the world's population began migrating to massive orbiting space colonies. All is
      not well, however, as a group of colonies furthest from the planet proclaims itself the Principality of Zeon and
      declares war on Earth.
      Half of the warring factions' populations have been destroyed and there appears to be no end in sight to this war
      between the Earth Federation and the Principality. An innocent civilian by the name of Amuro Ray is drawn into the
      conflict, and it's this young man, more specifically, his Gundam, that players control. Based upon the anime,
      gameplay in Mobile Suit Gundam is reminiscent of Armored Core 2, requiring players to pilot the robot-like Gundam

    <story>Mobile Suit Gundam: Zeonic Front (known as Zeonic Front: Kidou Senshi Gundam 0079 [1] in Japan) is a game for
      the PlayStation 2, which revolves around a Zeon Special Commando Unit during the One Year War, called the Midnight
      Fenrir Corp. This MS team was created by Kycilia Zabi and participated in the capture of the California Base
      during the 2nd Earth Invasion Plan.

      Lt. Garret Schmitzer was a mobile suit veteran during the first stage of the One Year War, the One Week Battle
      back in January. At the end of the One Week Battle, Lt. Schmitzer was badly wounded, and forced into retirement.
      This was due to Operation British, the operation that would force a space colony, into the Earth's orbit for a
      collision course to South America, where the Federation's top forces were, Jaburo base.

      The injuries were extensive, but hope was on the horizon. Kycillia Zabi formed an elite mobile suit unit onto the
      front lines, the Fenrir Corps. Since Lt. Schmitzer was fluent in battle experience, he was the lead commander and
      mission director of the Fenrir Corps, better known as the Midnight Fenrir.

      You take command of Midnight Fenrir Corps in the game. Eventually, by completing missions, more pilots will join
      in the Fenrir Corps' long and hard fought struggle.

      It is the first Gundam based PlayStation 2 game that lets the player operate solely as Zeon forces</story>

    <story>Mojib Ribbon is the psuedo-sequel to Vib Ribbon. Instead of being based around the tone of your music, it
      revolves around lyrics and rap. The protagonist, Mojibri, wants to become a famous rapper. You assist him in this
      as he raps his way through various stages. Along the way, Mojibri meets two other characters - a girl called
      Mojiko, and a robot called Osorezan. Although they look different, gameplay is all the same. You only use up and
      down on the Right Analog Stick for all control.

      In each level, Mojibri will be walking along a circle of clouds. Gameplay is similar to writing with a pen - you
      need to lift your brush (by pressing up) to get ink, then press down just as you walk on markers that are on
      certain parts of the clouds. This will start Mojibri writing, and he will read out what he's writing as he does
      so. You then need to let go of the Analog Stick at the end of the sentence to finish it properly.</story>

      You choose two weapons for each mission from dozens of various missile launchers, machine guns, flamethrowers and
      more unique weapons, some, faster, more powerful or better suited to the mission at hand than others, are given
      infinite ammo (though the weapons must still be reloaded after each clip is used up) and are set loose in one of
      several (usually city-based) fully destructible environments. Players can also mount a vehicles such as an air
      bike, a tank and a helicopter.

      The player recovers and increases his maximum health and armour, and unlocks new weapons by picking up power-ups
      from defeated enemies that spawn in and come at the player by the dozen. The game also features 2-player

      shop on the PlayStation 2 in this release of Monster Rancher 3. Though many characters and places are recognizable
      from earlier releases in the series, monsters in this game are represented in a cel-shaded cartoon style, similar
      to that of the Dreamcast's Jet Grind Radio or the contemporary PS2 release Yanya Caballista featuring Gawoo.


      As the game receives improved graphics and some additional features with its move to the more powerful console,
      many of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version.
      Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the
      game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the
      game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random,
      certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk.</story>

    <story>Monster Trux Extreme: Offroad Edition, as the name implies, is a Monster Truck arcade racing game. There are
      3 engine classes to choose from: V6, V8 or V12. There are also 8 different trucks to choose from, and a total of
      12 different courses (some of which consist in a previous course mirrored or in a different daytime condition). At
      first, only one engine class, two trucks and one courses will be available, the others having to be unlocked while
      playing the game.

      Each race is played against 3 computer opponents (or 2 in split-screen mode). During the races, 2 types of power
      ups can be collected: wrenches and nitros. Wrenches recover the trucks' damage gauge, and come in two types, one
      that repairs one unity of the damage gauge and one which fully repairs the truck. Nitros can be used to boost the
      truck speed for a while, each one filling 1/3 of the trucks' nitro gauge. If the player runs over yellow speed
      stripes on the courses, a little speed boost will be gained. Dollar symbols can also be collected, adding money to
      the player's profile. Money can be used to unlock new trucks, but it isn't spent: to unlock a new truck, the
      player only has to have the required amount of money. Money can be lost if the player depletes the whole damage
      gauge by bumping into obstacles or other vehicles: the truck explodes and respawns at the cost of 10 money units.

    <story>The fifth Mortal Kombat fighting game is the first to be designed exclusively for home consoles instead of
      the arcades. The game features a new 3D engine to support the familiar combination of weapon and hand-to-hand
      combat, but moves are now based on real-life martial arts styles, such as Crane, Snake, Tai Chi, Tae Kwon Do, Muay
      Thai, Tang Soo Doo, and more. Fighting styles can be switched at any time during a match, and the damage a
      character receives will be visible on his or her face, body, clothing, or movements.



      Returning characters from the best-selling series include Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Cyrax, Jax, Raiden, Sonya, Kitana,
      Shang Tsung, Quan Chi, and Reptile. Characters making their debut in Deadly Alliance include a female counterpart
      for Sub-Zero, a blind samurai, and a masked tribal warrior. Arenas take place in fully 3D environments, fraught
      with spiked pits, pools of acid, and other deadly hazards. New special moves and gruesome fatalities will also be

    <story>Mr. Golf is a one to four player golf game. This is not a simulation where real players and courses are
      recreated in minute photorealistic detail, this is a fun game where the players are all drawn in a cute cartoony
      style and the courses are all fictitious.

      There are two modes of play, stroke play or match play. Matches can be over three, six, nine or eighteen holes.
      Initially there are six characters to play as and just four courses but others can be unlocked by winning full
      eighteen hole matches.
      There is no player creation feature, no career mode and no difficulty settings in this game. There is background
      music and an in-game commentary which was a surprise but this is limited to stock phrases such as 'Nice shot!',
      'You've kept it on the fairway', 'Bad luck' and so on.

      There is an in-game tutorial which covers all the controls. By default the right analogue stick controls the shot,
      the further back it is pulled the more power is transferred to the swing when the stick is pushed forward, while
      the left analogue stick aims the shot so that the player can allow for the wind. There is a game configuration
      option that swaps the use of the right/left sticks around. The 'best' club is auto selected by the game but this
      can be changed by using R1/L1 to cycle through available clubs, R2/L2 change the player's stance. When taking a
      shot the player can take as many practice swings as they like to gauge how much back swing they want to use, the
      right D-Pad button swaps the player from practice mode into shot mode to take the actual shot.

      The full game has fourteen playable characters, eight courses plus 'mirrored courses' all of which can be played
      in any of four seasons.</story>

      numerous opponents you encounter fire a very significant number of bullets, often completely covering the entire
      playfield. The player will need to either dodge these by navigating through the complex pattern formed or by
      utilising the shield that is available for a limited time. As is typical for arcade style shooters, weapon
      upgrades are available to make blasting enemies easier.

      Mushihimesama features three difficulty levels, original arcade, maniac, and ultra. In addition to these three
      modes found in the original arcade version, the PS2 version also adds a practice mode where any stage and boss
      battle can be practiced as well as the arrange mode. In arrange mode, the player begins fully equipped with weapon

    <story>Experience the freedom of finally being able to play everything that you can imagine - with Music Maker:
      RockStar, your guitar controller behaves like a genuine instrument.

      But before you start freestyle rocking, you need to choose your favourite guitar! 5 basic guitar models are
      available, from the simple acoustic strummer to a heavily distorted electric axe with amplifiers on overdrive.
      Music Maker: RockStar doesn't just let you play different guitar models with the guitar controller â€“ you can
      also record everything and combine the different guitars with each other!

      With Music Maker: RockStar, everyone who owns a guitar controller accepts an entirely new kind of challenge â€“
      and it won't be easy! When you're play freestyle you get no assistance, but everything is recorded. If you make a
      mistake, then you'll be able to hear it - along with everyone else. The experience is just like with a real
      guitar. Concentration and a lot of practice will make you into a real freestyle legend.

      The sound can be changed with the strum bar and the whammy bar, letting you easily switch between fast riffs,
      slower chord sequences, and individual sounds. As you'd expect, the coloured buttons on the neck of the guitar
      control the pitch.

      Music Maker: RockStar transforms your living room into a complete virtual studio! Over 4,000 sounds are waiting to
      be used via the guitar controller during your recording sessions. Rocking drums, warm basses, crystal clear
      pianos, and brutal strings included. The best part is that you decide for yourself how your rock song is composed.
      While the guitar controller is responsible for your recordings, you can use the normal PS2 controller in the
      studio to specify your sounds and effects in more detail.

      The BeatBox and sampler provide two essential studio tools for creating beats and designing your own guitar riffs.
      Build the ultimate rock groove for your guitar controller solo. Develop uncompromising, innovative riffs. Polish
      your sound, and then turn it up.

      To top it all off, you have a USB microphone at home, then you can use it to record your own vocals directly in
      Music Maker: RockStar: Just connect the mic to the console and anyone can sing into it. It's a great way to add
      that certain special something to your own rock songs, not to mention lots of fun and laughs in your living room.

      You supply the guital controller, USB mics and poodle rock wig, and Music Maker: RockStar will take care of the
      rest. Rock on!</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      The storyline is simple: We arrive to our uncle's ranch dreaming about starting horse racing. But the situation
      isn't going very well. No horse has won for a few seasons and even worse, some are falling sick. As the story
      unfolds we realise that the only way to get the ranch out from its financial problems is to win the final race in

      open up each of the mini-games.

      glasses, shirts, pants, skirts, and shoes. Each of these parts can then be assigned different colors.

      The neighborhood is explored in 3rd person perceptive and includes a slide, monkey bars, swings and a
      merry-go-round to play on. In addition to My House, there are seven houses in the neighborhood. At each house
      lives a kid who asks the player to play a mini-game. Mini-games include RC Racing, Volleyball, Dodgeball,
      Chemistry, Marbles, Lawn-mowers, and Chicken Herding. The games can be played with two to four kids that can
      either be controlled by humans or computer. Up to four people can play the game, either through a multi-tap or
      online. All the games are fully 3D but are viewed from a stationary camera so that the entire play field and all

      OS and Microsoft Windows on May 8, 2001; versions for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were released in late 2002.

      As in previous games, the player assumes the role of the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race,
      Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an
      Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure.
      The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book.

      The creators of the Myst franchise gave the task of creating the third Myst game to Presto Studios, known for its
      adventure game series The Journeyman Project. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles
      and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted.</story>

    <story>Nano Breaker is designed to offer fast-paced combat action in a distant sci-fi future. Once an incredible
      boon to all human endeavors, microscopic nano-machines have begun to harvest the blood of their hosts in order to
      construct an army of killer machines.
      Players take control of humanity's last hope -- a mechanically augmented warrior who wields a transformable plasma
      blade weapon. It will take quick reflexes and good technique to stave off the seemingly endless advance of enemy
      units deployed by the nanotechnology, but the cyborg hero must prevail. In addition to the story-driven adventure,
      a "Time Attack" mode provides quick, pick-up-and-play hack-and-slash adventure.</story>

      Ninja series, known in Japan as the Narutimate Hero series. It is a fighting game with cel-shaded graphics
      resembling figures straight out of the manga. Ultimate Ninja contains twelve characters from the show, each with
      their own unique movesets and special attacks. In the overseas versions, two more bonus characters were added:
      Curse Mark Sasuke and Nine-Tailed Naruto. These were already playable in the Japanese version as a stronger mode
      for the regular characters, but split off into separate characters for the other versions. As such, the base
      characters cannot transform into these variations in the versions released outside of Japan.

      The characters can fight in several locations seen in the show and comics, such as Hidden Leaf Village, the Chunin
      Exam arena, and the Forest of Death. There is a main story mode with six battles and dialogue between the
      characters.</story>

    <story>Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 4 is the first game in the series that moves into the Shippuden storyline.
      The newly added "Master Mode" tells an original story that takes place during Naruto's journey with Jiraiya and is
      centered around a demon named Black Shadow who demands human sacrifices from a nearby village. After this is
      resolved the mode continues with Shippuden's regular Kazekage story arc.

      The "Master Mode" features a small but open game world for the player to explore. Naruto can collect items, fight
      enemies and talk to people in order to progress. However, the actual fighting remains to be the core of the
      Ultimate Ninja experience and was more refined and expanded in Ultimate Ninja 4. When two opponents clash, they
      will begin a series of high-speed attacks, appearing as a pair of blurs flashing across the stage. The winner is
      determined by a game similar to that of Rock, Paper, Scissors. There is also the addition of "Awakening Jutsu", a
      technique that is more powerful than the standard Ultimate Jutsu and, as the name implies, "awakens" a character's
      hidden powers and can only be used when certain conditions are met.</story>

      It is developed by EA Tiburon and released on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and mobile phones in
      North America on June 10, 2008.[1] On March 12, 2008, EA announced Jeff Gordon as the cover athlete for NASCAR
      09.[2] Through the career mode, "Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup", Gordon leads a mentoring program,[3] a new
      feature offered in NASCAR 09.[4] This is also the third EA Sports NASCAR video game to appear on a handheld system
      for Mobile phone version.

      In October 2007, Electronic Arts moved the PlayStation 2 game development to a new studio in North Carolina to be
      able to get better information with the NASCAR teams in an attempt to improve the game. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox
      360 versions of the game were still made at the old studio.[5]

      Due to the development team using certain resources to work on key features in the game, no car manufacturers were
      present in this year's title.[6]

      To date, this is the last NASCAR game to be produced by EA, and the last NASCAR game for the PlayStation 2, after
      suffering from slumping sales, the difficulty of installing new features, and the lack of popularity. In 2009,
      NASCAR Kart Racing was released, replacing any 2009 installment for the annual series. It may be EA's last game
      before their exclusive license with NASCAR expires. Yet the door to NASCAR games for the PlayStation 2 has been
      shut, as Polyphony Digital's Gran Turismo 5 was not featured for the sixth-generation console.

      For game players in Canada, while the game was still released only in English, the instruction manual and box
      cover were bilingual, with text in both English and French.</story>

      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>NCAA Football was an American football video game series developed by EA Sports in which players control and
      compete against current Division I FBS college teams. The series is a younger brother to the Madden NFL series.

      In July 2013, the NCAA announced that it would not renew its licensing contract with Electronic Arts because of an

      use of the NCAA name and related logos, not those of individual schools and conferences, which are negotiated
      individually or through the Collegiate Licensing Company. The CLC concurrently announced that it would extend its

      include over 200 licensed fight songs, 3D cheerleaders and 144 different schools.

      Dynasty mode has been enhanced with the ability to redshirt a player and schedule your non-conference games before
      each season. In Dynasty Mode you can win all the real trophies to add to your own personal collection which you
      can show off later. These awards include the Heisman, Coach of the Year and Bowl-specific trophies. You can also
      win special trophies for winning certain rivalry games, which is another new play mode in 2003. There are 23
      different "Rivalry" trophies for you to earn to go alongside your Dynasty trophies.

      Create-A-School mode makes it into this edition, letting you create your own football team. Everything from the
      logos on the field to your school's fight song can be customized. Your created team can be played in Exhibition
      play or imported into Dynasty mode.</story>

    <story>The NCAA Basketball (formerly NCAA March Madness) series was a College basketball game which was published by
      EA Sports from 1998 until 2009. After EA Sports' rival publisher 2K Sports cancelled its own college basketball
      game, College Hoops, in 2008, EA changed the name of the series from NCAA March Madness to NCAA College
      Basketball. The series was discontinued on February 10, 2010.[1]

      Like other games based on NCAA sports, it could not feature the players' names (as that is against NCAA
      policy/rules), so only the players' numbers were used in the rosters. Users were able to edit the rosters, putting
      in the correct names for each team if they wished to do so. Many player last names were built into the in-game
      commentary, like in the NBA Live series.

      Verne Lundquist, Brad Nessler, and Gus Johnson lent their voices for play-by-play in the games at various times.
      Lundquist was the original announcer, with Nessler taking over in the mid-2000s and Johnson joining him for the
      most recent game in the series. Bill Raftery and Dick Vitale were analysts. Raftery originally worked with
      Lundquist on their games and returned to work alongside Johnson for CBS-branded games in NCAA Basketball 10, while
      Vitale and Nessler joined the series at the same time.</story>

      to be in their crew and the active friendly racer is known as a wingman. Each hirable street racer has two skills,
      one which is a racing skill (scout, blocker, and drafter) and a non-race skill (fixer, mechanic, and fabricator).
      Each skill has different properties from finding hidden alleys/back streets (shortcuts) to reducing police
      attention. Cars driven by the wingmen are also different; blockers drive muscles, drafters drive exotics and
      scouts drive tuners (although the first two unlockable wingmen (Neville and Sal) drive cars according to the
      player's chosen car class at the start of the game). In career mode, players have to race tracks and win to

      racing simulation. Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing
      drivers, but the cops.

      Choose from a selection of today's (and yesterday's) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a
      range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more.

      The competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks
      allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These
      points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks.

      The Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops.
      They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks
      and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.</story>

      Sergeant Cross (played by Dean McKenzie), who vows to take down the player and end street racing in Rockport.
      Races seem to be in the player's favor until a particular group of racers, led by the game's antagonist, Clarence
      "Razor" Callahan (played by Derek Hamilton), sabotages and win the player's car in a race.

      Without a car to escape in, the player is arrested by Cross, but is later released due to lack of evidence. Mia
      picks up the player and then informs the player about Razor's new status on the Blacklist, a group of 15 drivers
      most wanted by the Rockport Police Department. She then helps by assisting the player in acquiring a new car and
      working his way up the Blacklist. Rivals are defeated one by one, and the player is rewarded with reputation, new
      rides, and ride improvements with every Blacklist member taken down.
      As new boroughs are opened up throughout Rockport (Rosewood, Camden Beach, and Downtown Rockport), Mia also sets
      up safehouses for the player to lie low in, in exchange for placement of "side bets" on the player's races.

      Okazaki. The protagonist is a normal high school girl attending Melrose Girls' Academy in Arcadia. One day, she is
      visited by a gentleman named Nyx and learns that she has the dormant power to purify Thanatos, or incorporeal
      monsters that prey on the everyman. She leaves her school life to join Nyx's Thanatos exterminating business:
      "Aube Hunters". She soon realizes that she is the only female with purification powers because she is the oft
      fabled Queen Egg, or a legendary savior. Her goal is to work with her fellow Aube Hunters to eradicate Thanatos
      and restore the land's peace.</story>

      SNK for the Neo Geo system. The Korean version of the game is known as "The Last Soldier". The Last Blade and its
      sequel are considered by some to be two of the most accomplished games available for the Neo Geo system.
      The game takes place during the "bakumatsu" era in Japan, and incorporates various elements of Japanese mythology
      (with a heavy emphasis on the symbology of the Four Symbols). As such, the background music generally incorporates
      synthesized instruments simulating a sound appropriate to the 19th century setting, in a Western classical,
      pseudo-Romantic style (unusual for a fighting game).</story>

    <story>Play a full season with your favorite team or try the franchise mode and build a legacy. You can even create
      teams and players.

      In general manager mode, when you go into the off-season, several different things happen. First, you'll see a
      list of players who have retired from your team and the reasons they've left, which are usually related to
      injuries or diminishing skills. If you lose some key players, then you'll need to make every effort to ensure that
      those positions are filled by free agents with similar skills or rookies who have solid potential. You're
      frequently stuck with trying your luck in the draft, where you can select a rookie based on how you finished the
      season, like in the real NFL draft. GameDay has a feature that gives you a breakdown on the draft and provides you
      with an overall rating for each rookie. Following the draft, you have to sign your rookies with whatever cap money
      you've set aside for that purpose. When you're all done, it's time to start the next season.</story>

    <story>Taking a detour from its traditional football games, Electronic Art presents its first 3-D NFL strategy game,
      NFL Head Coach, focusing more on a coaching perspective than a player's perspective. You experience the day to day
      job as a NFL coach, recruiting big players, meeting with assistant coaches and running practice drills.

      Become a legend in the coaching industry by creating pro bowl caliber players, winning Super Bowls and mentoring
      coordinators into great coaches themselves in hopes of earning a spot in the Hall of Legends. You can also use the
      USB Headset to call plays like a real coach, giving you a much more realistic feel to the game as well. It gives
      you an idea of how tedious a head coaches job can really be.</story>

    <story>New rules and updated rosters and season schedules feature in this update of the longrunning NHL series, as
      do many new features.

      Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves of star players that confuse
      opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a
      shot, a bull's-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To
      add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the
      players' momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed
      boosts.

      With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a
      shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In
      the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the
      thumbstick is used for "face sculpting" - changing the different features.

      All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete,
      with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now
      intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team.

      The PC, PS2 and Xbox version support online multiplayer games, and as a special bonus, the original NHL 94 game,
      one of the first in the series, has been included with the PS2 edition.</story>

    <story>NHL Hitz Pro is an ice hockey video game developed by Next Level Games and published by Midway Games. It's
      the third and final game of the NHL Hitz series. It was released on September 25, 2003, for the PlayStation 2,
      Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox. Unlike the previous titles in the series, this game has 5-on-5 gameplay instead of
      the usual 3-on-3 gameplay with the earlier titles. Despite that fact, however, the game does not include penalty
      shots, and it is still an arcade-type hockey game like its predecessors. It also has, as the name suggests, a lot
      of hard hitting, appealing more often to casual hockey fans than hardcore ones. The cover athlete of the game is
      Nicklas LidstrÃ¶m, and features commentary from Tim Kitzrow[1] and Harry Teinowitz.

      Unlike many other hockey video games of the 21st century, NHL Hitz Pro had the IIHF license, enabling it to use
      the jerseys of the Olympic hockey teams.

      The game also has many game modes, one of the most popular being the "Pick-Up Hockey" game mode, where the game
      would turn into either a roller, street, or pond hockey match-up between two amateur teams.</story>

    <story>NHRA Drag Racing: Countdown to the Championship is a simulation of drag-racing. It features four different
      classes of car (Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock, and Pro Stock Motorcycle), with the PSP version having Jet Powered
      as a bonus in Quick Race mode. There are 5 modes: Tutorial, Quick Race, Single Event, Career, and Vs.

      The tutorial is a series of videos that walk the player through the steps needed to properly race without getting
      disqualified. Quick race lets the player select a vehicle, driver, and weather, then simply race. (Unique to the
      PSP version is the ability to race different classes against each other, with the less powerful car getting a head
      start.) Single event mode strings together multiple races. It includes 4 qualifying rounds, then the top 16 racers
      will move on to an elimination tournament. Career follows a driver through multiple events, tracking money from
      wins and spent on repairs. Vs is a quick race between two human players. On the PSP, this is done through ad-hoc
      wireless; on the PS2, split-screen.</story>

      period (from the XV to the XVII century).

      The main game screen shows an overhead 3D rendered view of the landscape, showing buildings and moving armies
      belonging to each clan. The player gives orders using a menu with a list of commands, that branch out with several
      options: City (to construct buildings), Personnel (to employ officers), Military (to move and attack with the
      army), Strategy, Diplomacy (to negotiate treaties and exchange technology) and others to review the resources. The

    <story>New York Race is game about future racing. Game is inspired by Luc Besson's film "Fifth Element". There are
      more than 30 high-tech flying machines to choose and pilot (including the notorious Taxi and the cool police car).

      There are four different modes available in NYR, the main one being the Championship mode that takes place over
      four different categories; Qualification, Beginner, Pro and Expert. Other modes include Single Race, Time Attack
      and the rather cool Keirin mode, that eliminates the contestant in last place at every checkpoint until the last
      man remains.

      In every race, you can pick up 4 elements which give you an added advantage: Water - leaves a liquid sphere behind
      you that slows your opponents down if they hit it, Fire - allows you to shoot a homing fireball at your opponents,
      Earth activates a temporary shield and Air - gives you a speed boost. 3 Dimensional action allows the player
      complete freedom of movement on a vertical and horizontal axis. The races take place on 12 tracks, which can be
      unlocked by advancing through levels. The tracks are divided into four districts: Jet Set, Middle Class, Seedy
      District and China Town.</story>

    <story>Okage: Shadow King is an RPG with a slight twist: it's humorous.

      The game's premise is that a boy (nameable by the player with the default name of Ari) makes a deal with an evil
      spirit to cure his sister of a curse that's caused her to speak entirely in pig Latin. The spirit, Evil King
      Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV (or Stan for short), assumes the role of your shadow and orders you to track down the
      lost remnants of his power, which have been siphoned away by impostor Evil Kings over the last few thousand years
      while he was trapped in a bottle. And, while you're at it, Stan would also like you to help him take over the
      world.

      The game plays similarly to most JRPGs. Ari will visit towns and fight (turn based) battles against monsters -
      which in this game happen to be things like wild cows and man eating onions. Party members level up and gain new
      skills as they gain experience. Ari can respond to the story and other characters with a number of different
      dialogue options, such as a nice response, a rude response, or a silly response, and how he acts will affect how
      different party members feel about him.</story>

      Camera is required to play this game. The second PS2 game is called 'Onmyou Taisenki - Hasha no In', and was
      released on June 26, 2005. It is a side-story with the same characters from the anime, where Kogenta and Riku
      train and become stronger through five Fukumaden, which are parallel worlds with lots of Youkai. The five
      Fukumaden featured in this game are Fire, Water, Tree, Earth and Disorder. The 'Gold' element from Onmyoudou is
      also featured in the game, but there is no Fukumaden for it.</story>

    <story>The game is set in a Nippon (Japan) based on Japanese folklore, and begins with a flashback to events 100
      years prior to the game's present; the narrator describes how Shiranui, a pure white wolf, and Nagi, a swordsman,
      together fought the eight-headed demon Orochi to save Kamiki Village and the maiden Nami, Nagi's beloved. Shiranui
      and Nagi are unable to defeat Orochi, but manage to seal the demon away.
      In the game's present, Susano, a descendant of Nagi and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, breaks Orochi's seal due
      to the fact that he does not believe in the legend and wants to prove it false; Orochi escapes and curses the
      lands, sapping the life from every living being. Sakuya, the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls
      forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and
      pleads for her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist Issun (an inch-high creature
      known as a Poncle), Amaterasu is able to restore the land to its former beauty.</story>

    <story>When city bear Boog is led into the forest by a mule deer named Elliot, it becomes Open Season for any
      unlucky hunters who happen to cross the bears path. Raised by Beth the park ranger, Boog is not used to living in
      the wild, and must tap into his instinctual abilities to make it back to Beth's garage in one piece. Players will
      guide Boog and Elliot through the forest using their environment to scare hunters away before they make a rug out
      of Boog's domesticated hide.
      Players may throw skunk bombs, hurl rabbits, enlist squirrels to fire acorns at their foes, and perform many other
      pranks that will have the hunters headed for the hills. Gamers can play alone or challenge friends to compete or
      cooperate in a variety of mini-games such as rolling in a giant snowball, riding rapids on a floating outhouse,
      taking a nice leisurely mine cart ride, and more.</story>

      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist

      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels

    <story>Orange Pocket is an adult Japanese visual novel developed by Hooksoft which was released on June 13, 2003 for
      Windows as a CD. Subsequent enhanced ports to the Dreamcast as Orange Pocket: Cornet and to the PlayStation 2 as
      Orange Pocket: Root were released. Both ports feature their own exclusive characters and new scenarios not in the
      original Windows release.
      The gameplay in Orange Pocket follows a plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of
      interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters.
      The story revolves around Hideaki Eda, who is enjoying a life in the country somewhere in Japan. His childhood
      friend moves from the city he used to live in to where he lives now and starts attending his school. She adapts to
      a rural life quickly and soon things start to become noisier as Hideaki begins to hang out with more girls from
      his school.</story>

      earth and wood trail him in a virtual supply line. Saw's job is to lay down these icons in contiguous
      water-earth-tree combinations in order to create small houses on earth patches.
      Plop down a 5 x 5 grid of these combinations and you'll create a little neighborhood. Once you've laid down the
      foundation of your fledgling town, drop down additional building supplies to develop the houses into bigger

    <story>The first game in the Outlaw series of sports titles, Outlaw Golf is what you get when you take the classic
      game of golf and throw in lesbian strippers, wannabe rappers, ex cons and other wild personalities. The game has a
      bad attitude chock full of sexual themes and language that puts Happy Gilmore to shame.
      Outlaw Golf pits you as one of ten over-the-top golfing personalities (paired with equally over-the-top caddies)
      to compete in over 30 different tour events from where you attempt to unlock new characters, better clubs and
      balls as well as improving your golfer's skills along the way with 12 different mini-games.
      The game also sports a composure response system, which simply means that when you do well, the game is easier and
      when you aren't doing so well you will find your shots not going exactly where you want them. Composure too low?
      Beat up your caddy and you can relieve some of that stress to regain your lost composure.</story>

    <story>Following the style of its predecessor, the original Outlaw Golf, the game stays true to bad attitude, sexual
      themes and bunch of losers who just happen to find something in common to take upon - a game of golf. The
      magnificent four are back, Harley, Summer, El Suave and Ice Trey, with several more characters to be unlocked as
      you blast through the courses, speaking of which, the former three from the original are back, and again, with
      newer ones to be played after earned and unlocked. If you wanna practice your moves and skills, you can select
      exhibition mode, or if you feel contempt enough, go take a tour and show 'em what you're made of. There are
      several additions not seen in the original game, such as different game modes as well as golf cart racing which
      lets you earn the legendary burning shot, though the beating of your caddy to raise your composure is still
      included. The game also supports online play.</story>

    <story>Hypnotix's Outlaw series takes on a new sport with its first simultaneous release for both Xbox and PS2. As
      in Outlaw Golf and Outlaw Volleyball, Outlaw Tennis is designed to combine rich, realistic sports gameplay with
      larger-than-life characters and an auxiliary rules system that rewards actions which most good people would
      consider extremely poor sportsmanship. For example, characters losing a match will also lose composure, which can
      turn luck against them and may cause them to play even more poorly. One way to win back composure is to start a
      fist fight with a character on the opposing team (as in Outlaw Volleyball).
      Most of these over-the-top features can be turned off, however, leaving players with a fairly straightforward
      tennis sim. The control scheme of Outlaw Tennis is designed to be similar to that of earlier 3D tennis games, so
      even players who are new to the series should find the game accessible, whether they're more interested in playing
      tennis or just playing as an outlaw.</story>

    <story>The fourth installment in Koei's P.T.O. series brings strategic naval combat to the PS2. There are two levels
      of play: global strategy and resource management are handled with a turn-based system on a world map while
      individual battles are fought using a real-time system on a much smaller scale.

      The campaign can be played as the Americans, British, Japanese, or Germans, starting either in September 1939 or
      December 1941. If a players chooses to be American or Japanese with a 1939 start date, they will sit on the
      sidelines and watch the war until December 1941, but they will still be able to gather resources and spend them to
      build units or develop technologies. Players can also concoct "what-if" scenarios by changing which countries
      belong to which powers: for example, one could play an Alliance of America and Germany against an Axis of Japan
      and Great Britain, or even play three-on-one for more of a challenge.</story>

      War II. The player can choose between a variety of WWII-era fight and bomber planes on both the US and Japanese
      side.

      In total, there are 25 missions in the campaign for each side. After the mission briefing, the player is taken to
      an upgrade screen, where they can buy various enhancements for their planes, ranging from weapon upgrades to
      increased speed and better handling. Upgrades are paid for by stars and stars in turn are awarded for successful
      missions. The amount the player gets depends on the difficulty of each mission.

      During most missions, it is possible to switch the aircraft type by landing on specific airfields. Taking off and
      landing is an automatic process, the player only has to fly through a series of guidance rings. The missions
      usually centre around destroying or protecting a certain amount of units.</story>

    <story>Panel Quiz Attack 25 is a game show airing on the Asahi Broadcasting Corporation network in Japan. It first
      aired on April 6, 1975, and is currently the only game show on Japanese television to use non-celebrity
      contestants. Presented by Kiyoshi Kodama until 2011, then by Yasuyuki Urakawa.
      GAMEPLAY:
      Four contestants, each designated by a different color (red, green, white, and blue), compete. The game is played
      on a grid of twenty-five numbered boxes in a manner similar to the game Reversi.
      The first question is a puzzle that is shown on the video screen; the first player to buzz in with the correct
      answer is awarded the center #13 box. After this, the contestants are introduced. From this point on, players are
      referred to by their designated color (in Japanese, red is "akai," green is "midori," white is "shiro," and blue
      is "ao").</story>

      Your tank is equipped with a cannon with limited ammo and a MG with unlimited ammo. With this arsenal you now have
      to complete different objectives (which can change throughout the mission) inside the missions like blowing up a
      fuel depot. In this process you also destroy and blow up many other things in the almost completely destroyable
      environment (from trees to houses) and of course you've to fight against enemy infantry and tanks.</story>

    <story>Paparazzi is a game where you take the role of a photographer who is after great shots of famous models.
      Unlike your typical paparazzi, you don't get to hide in bushes and take photos of women in compromising positions
      - instead, you go to preset photo shoots, and try to take the best shots of the subject using your rolls of film.
      You have a choice of three different models to take photographs of: Riho (a sporty girl), Lena (a supermodel), and
      Nano (an Internet idol).

      Initially, you have a basic camera, but as you take better photographs, you can earn more money to upgrade its
      functionality. New lenses, such as telephoto and wide angle lenses can be used, and a tripod can be purchased to
      stop your shaky hands.</story>

      and keep the vehicle running smoothly.
      Even minor abuses build up over the two-week contest. Barreling through too many potholes can ruin a suspension.
      Those tumbleweeds seem light and insignificant, but hitting too many off them might crack the windshield. As in
      the real-life race, an important part of the game is managing the little details to keep the car and its driver

      Lord Zetta, the king of Netherworld, tried to rewrite the history of the land but didn't succeed, and in the
      process brought demise onto himself. Three evil Overlords appeared before Zetta and promised to help him in his
      quest to take over the land once more. The player takes control of Zetta and his army to return Netherworld to its

      The game mechanics consist of several stages in which the player must defeat the enemy or fulfill other tasks to
      advance to the next level. Fighting is done in turns, meaning that once the player has moved and attacked, it's
      the enemy's turn to move his troops one by one. When the battle is won, the next level becomes selectable. Between
      fights, you can improve your squad of fighters by buying better weapons, recruiting more soldiers and so on.

    <story>Twenty-two years after making his groundbreaking debut on the Atari 2600, Activision's Pitfall Harry returns
      for more jungle-exploring action. The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set
      in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original,
      players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous
      pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.

      His objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in
      danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or
      two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the
      original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before
      them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use
      its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender
      body.


      As the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The
      other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who
      becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival,
      eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful
      owners. He hands Harry the "Hero's Handbook" and Harry's off to adventure. The "Hero's Handbook's" pages are
      scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are. Find new pages, and Harry will learn new moves.

      tournaments, the player find himself in smoky pubs with opponents like truck-drivers and lightly clad biker women.
      The handling, however, is similar to other pool games. The player has a lot of opportunities to tweak the position
      of the cue. A analog stick or mouse movement simulates the shot.

      The game features ten pool variants, including popular ones like Eight-Ball and trick shots or exotic ones like
      snowboat pool. When playing the career mode (called "Hustler"), the player can bet money. The winnings are
      reinvested in clothes or pieces of equipment which look different but have no bearings on gameplay. Every
      successful match unlocks the next of overall 20 opponents.</story>

      The game begins in 1930 and moves on to the year 2030 as the player controls a Predator from a third-person view
      in expansive levels. The Predator's arsenal includes a staff, maul, glaive, explosive mines, spear gun, and a set

      mangle the many enemies in the game, ultimately hunting the alpha male whose skull would make a worthy prize.

    <story>Premier Manager 08 is a soccer manager where the player is responsible for the athletic and financial success
      of his team. Similarly to other games of the sort, there are a lot of details to take care of, e.g. searching for
      sponsors, stadium expansion, player transfers, lineup and tactics. But, as usual for English soccer managers, the
      emphasis is on the athletic aspect.

      The player character earns experience depending on his successes and unlocks new abilities with it, like
      constructing a certain building. The same goes for the staff members. The second innovation is a new bar where the
      player has quick access to his staff members who keep him up to date - this replaces the usual news systems. The
      matches themselves use an abstract presentation: the soccer field is shown in a top-down, tactical perspective and
      the player movements are shown with blue and yellow balls. The game features about 400 teams in six leagues.

    <story>Premier Manager 09 is the longest running football management simulation in the games industry.

      The main focus of Premier Manager games lately is ease of use, aiming for a pick up and play audience rather than
      hard-core football simulation fanatics.

      It offers a simpler management game with a less complex match and tactics engine to appeal to younger gamers who
      are looking for a casual introduction to football management.

      The game boasts:


      A maximum of 6 playable leagues to choose from (England, Germany, Spain, Italy, France &amp; Scotland) each with
      their own sub divisions.

      An easy to use interface for full management of a chosen club, with a browser style favourites section to store
      most visited options.

      RPG style levelling up of players, staff and facilities over time.

      An all new stadium builder which allows for controlled expansion of stadium capacity with the option to move to
      new stadiums.

      Improved look and feel with faster navigation of menus and club specific themes and backgrounds.</story>

    <story>Featuring five nations (England with three leagues and Germany, Spain, France and Italy with two), PM takes a
      new approach to the series, not much different from the classic Match Day Manager. Each day has several time slots
      (from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.) which your secretary can fill with appointments with other staff members, the chairman or
      players in order to discuss contracts and other working orders. While you can act freely between time slots, most
      actions can only be completed after a meeting with the staff.

      As usual with managers with less detailed databases (those who don't allow to manage in the Estonian second
      division while tapping the youth pool in Taiwan), the player is also in control of setting ticket prices (and
      stadium building), advertising and website (which increases the value of the club, and lead to higher merchandise
      sales) and manage staff.

      All staff conversations and player information screens are presented in full 3D, as well as the match engine. The
      news screen is based on real-life sports news TV channel EurosportNews.</story>

    <story>Prisoner of War is a third-person action game that has players attempting to escape from a variety of prison
      camps during World War II, including the infamous Stalag Luft and the secure confines of Colditz Castle. As an
      American pilot named Lewis Stone, players must learn the daily routines of each camp before plotting a daring
      escape. An overhead-view radar is displayed in the corner of the screen while the action takes place from a
      perspective behind Captain Stone as he ducks, sneaks, and runs away from his German captors.
      In addition to devising an escape plan, carefully noting patrols, roll calls, and meal times, players will also
      steal cars, destroy communications equipment, and work with a variety of fellow prisoners to distract the enemy's
      attention. As Stone uncovers more about what the Nazis are planning, he vows to find a way to rendezvous with
      Winston Churchill's Special Operations Executive before it's too late.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>Pump It Up: Exceed is a dancing game similar to the games in the Dance Dance Revolution series. The Pump It
      Up dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle
      which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game.

      The general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols
      on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the
      music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the
      life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends.</story>

    <story>A sequel to Puyo Puyo Fever, the next-gen re-imagining of the classic arcade puzzle game Puyo Puyo, in which
      you play against either an AI or player controlled opponent to see who can stack and arrange the falling blobs (or
      "puyos") in the correct color patterns that allow you to send "garbage" puyos to the opposing player and help
      flood him and lose.

      The game includes a single-player arcade mode, as well as a story mode with 3 different characters and campaigns
      that take you across the game world battling different sets of enemies. The "fever" meter from the previous game
      returns (which increases the number and abilities of the garbage puyos you send depending on how many puyos you
      chain in succession) and a new ranking system has been implemented that awards you money you can use between

      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels

    <story>Radirgy is a vertical-screen top-down bullet-hell shooter originally developed by Milestone for Naomi arcade
      system and later released on console systems.
      The game features bright, cartoony, cel-shaded graphics. At the beginning, the player is given choice among three
      different mecha-ships: one with a spread-gun, a weak homing laser, or a slow but powerful bubble gun.
      Additionally, each ship can use a sword for anything that gets too close, or specific enemies which can't be
      killed otherwise, a shield, which appears at the front of the ship once the player lets go of the fire button, and
      a smart-bomb-like field that can be extended around the player in a small circle, damaging enemies, absorbing
      their shots and turning them into points.</story>

    <story>The continent of Atranart is at the verge of doom and destruction.
      Monsters appear everywhere and their sole purpose seems to be mayhem and destruction upon all lands.
      Player takes control one of four heroes: knight, wizard, priestess or warrior, and then it's time to cleanse the
      land from evil once again.
      Very action oriented adventure in the world of magic and heroes is the deal here, and many, many monsters will die
      and lots of hacking and slashing to be done before the quest is over.
      The said quest is nine differently themed levels long, each one consisting of several smaller stages in which the
      player must accomplish a set number of tasks before she can move along to the next one. There is also a
      multiplayer mode, which is a versus mode game where maximum of four people can take on each other.</story>

    <story>Ratchet &amp; Clank is a platform/adventure game in a similar vein to the 3D versions of the Rayman, Sonic,
      Mario, or other games. It involves the two protagonists Ratchet, a furry alien creature, and Clank, a nerdy little
      robot, going on a quest to find Captain Qwark and ultimately to help save the galaxy.

      Ratchet &amp; Clank includes many of the best features of previous similar games, but makes itself unique in a
      number of ways. Firstly each of the game's levels are huge sweeping vistas with extremely detailed buildings which
      are visible at all times (i.e. there is no distance fog). This means that a building on the horizon is not just a
      "backdrop"; in all likelihood Ratchet will be exploring it in a few moments time. Secondly, the game includes a
      number of sub-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile
      Command in the first person.

      The game has over twenty levels (planets) and includes as many real-time cut-scenes which tell the story. Also of
      note is that the story is non-linear, requiring the player to return to previous levels to complete objectives and
      to choose between multiple paths forward. There is also a respectable array of weapons, gadgets, and accessories
      to find or buy as the game progresses, which offer some unique gameplay features.</story>

      involves Ratchet and Clank, along with Al, being kidnapped and forced to compete in a underground reality show
      called "DreadZone" run by the media mogul Gleeman Vox on the outer fringes of the galaxy.

      The game differs from its predecessors in that it focuses more on shooting than platforming and puzzle elements.
      The game allows you to use two bots to fight along side you, which can be upgraded over time with better weapons
      and firepower. There is a total of 10 weapons in the game, significantly less than the other games. However,
      modding these weapons is more emphasized than before, with different kinds of Alpha and Omega mods. Omega mods can
      be used on any weapon, and range from the freeze mod to the magma mod. Alpha mods are weapon-specific, and
      increase the rate of fire, ammo capacity, and power. The game also features online multiplayer.

      Clank is not a playable character in this game, although he gives advice to Ratchet over his communication link.

    <story>The game series that began as Re-Volt has come to the Playstation 2, bringing remote-controlled action and
      mayhem to the next-generation system. While most racing games seek to bring the realistic feel of driving an
      actual car into the virtual world, RC Revenge Pro tries to capture the whimsy of RC racing. RC Revenge Pro has
      decidedly kart-style overtones and will take you through tracks that could only exist in the imagination of those
      who designed them.</story>

    <story>Real World Golf is a golfing game that makes use of the Gametrak system. The Gametrak is an external piece of
      hardware that is included with the game. The Gametrak can, through the use of gloves which are connected to it
      with tiny wires, accurately read out the swing the player makes with the included tiny golf club. It determines
      the power with which you hit, but also any effects you may put on the ball. The Gametrak can read out speeds
      ranging from 2000 miles per hour to 1 millimeter per hour.

      Once you start the game you no longer need to use your keyboard or gamepad, all menus can be navigated with use of
      simple hand gestures. The game itself contains ten 18-hole courses which have to be unlocked one by one. You can
      play in various modes such as tournament, championship, training and party. Party mode includes several mini games
      such as hitting cars in the parking lot, hitting a giant bulls-eye in the sky, hitting as close to a target as
      possible or hitting through hoops. Each game mode can be played against the AI or friends in hotseat multiplayer.

      available for PlayStation 2 is that it does not support the DualShock Controller at all - it uses its own wireless

      swings.

      There is a Driving Range and a Putting Course to practice on before setting out on a full round of Golf. The game
      is set amongst 8 courses, featuring environments from the U.K, USA, France, New Zealand, Scotland and the
      Caribbean. There is a range of A.I. players to compete against, each with their own personality and play style.
      These can be unlocked as reward for winning tournaments, achieving given feats or reducing your handicap.</story>

    <story>Billed as the ideal solution to the Christmas shopping Wii shortages, the Realplay system for PS2 brings
      motion sensitive control to Sony's last-gen console. While it's easy to scoff at the range of themed controllers
      and accompanying games, there is certainly space for more motion control. With Christmas becoming more expensive
      every year, and PlayStation 2s tucked under televisions across the country, Realplay has the potential to be an
      affordable way of bringing casual gaming to homes across the country.

      The way the system works is that unlike the Wii, each title comes with its own specific controller. At Â£35 to
      Â£40 for a game with controller, Realplay might seem expensive by PlayStation 2 standards. However, compared to
      the trouble of finding a Wii, buying it and then purchasing a game, for most Realplay will be the most affordable
      option.

      Each controller comes with a simple gadget that looks like an oversized USB memory stick. Plugging this device
      into your PlayStation 2's USB port instantly connects the controller, but unfortunately you need to swap USB
      receivers as you jump from one game to another. There's also no space in the PlayStation 2's twin-USB ports for
      two receivers.</story>

    <story>REALPLAY Puzzlesphere is an action puzzle game in the vein of Marble Madness and Super Monkey Ball using the
      Realplay system of motion sensitive controllers. Included with a game is a motion sensitive orb that works much
      like a Wii Remote. If you tilt it in any direction the ball on screen will gather up momentum in that direction.
      The further you tilt it the more momentum it will gather. The goal of the game is to guide the ball on the screen
      through complex 3D courses where you have to avoid gaps, make jumps and roll around sharp corners. There are
      various checkpoints along the way that serve as respawn points and make sure the player doesn't cut short on the
      designated circuit. When the ball on screen falls out of bounds the player loses a life. He only receives a few
      lives for each level where he has to make do with. One additional control is the air brake that applies a sudden
      momentum in the exact opposite direction as the current rolling direction. This can be used for late escapes. To
      make it more difficult fans can try to blow you off course. A variety of power-ups can be collected to improve
      your air brake for example, but they are placed at hard to get locations.

      The game comes with 36 levels in 6 different environments. There are four game modes: practice, arcade, time trial
      and 2-4 player time attack.</story>

    <story>In this game, the player controls Mouse, a silent musician who travels with his talking guitar Pattimo. One
      day Mouse is invited to play at a royal wedding on an island called Pandule. But soon he discovers that the groom
      Xelpherpolis has put an awful time-looping spell on the island, and intends to destroy this way the entire
      population. Mouse has to stop the villain and, most importantly, recruit other people to help him break the spell.

      Ephemeral Fantasia is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat. Several characters can be
      recruited to the party. The game's stand-out feature is the time-looping system, which is somewhat similar to the
      one implemented in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The game has an internal clock, and the first five days
      repeat themselves until Mouse finds a way to stop it. Certain events occur only if Mouse travels to a specific
      location at a specific time.</story>

    <story>Remember 11: The Age of Infinity is a Japanese visual novel produced by KID, originally released on March 18,
      2004 for the PlayStation 2. The game was released for the PC as a part of the Infinity plus on April 4, 2008. A
      handheld version for PlayStation Portable was released in 2009, while a similar version for Android and iOS was
      released in 2012. Unlike its predecessor, Ever 17: The Out of Infinity, the game was never officially released in
      English, but a complete English fan-translation exists.
      Remember 11 is the third entry of the Infinity series by KID. The previous games in the series were Never 7: The
      End of Infinity and Ever 17: The Out of Infinity, both of which take place within the same universe. It was
      followed by an "official" fourth title Code 18 which had no involvement from the series' previous main directors
      and writers. In contrast to the other two Infinity games and most visual novels, Remember11 does not have a renai
      focus or plot routes that are based on specific heroes or heroines.
      After KID announced bankruptcy in 2007, CyberFront took over the brand name; rights have been given to T-TIME
      Technology of Taiwan to release a Chinese version for Windows.</story>

      There, the Umbrella Corporation performed scientific experiments that went wrong. The result of their experiments
      was a virus that led to the creation of a huge number of zombies as well as a variety of other creatures bent on a

    <story>Resident Evil: Dead Aim, known as Gun Survivor 4: Biohazard: Heroes Never Die in Japan, is the fourth release
      in a series of light gun shooter video games by Capcom. It is also the first in the franchise to feature
      first-person shooting alongside the third-person movement seen in its predecessors in the Resident Evil series. It
      was developed by Capcom's Production Studio 3 and could be released for the PlayStation 2 as the company's
      then-effective exclusivity contract with Nintendo pertained only to numbered entries in the series.
      The Capcom series that helped establish the survival horror genre steps back into the faster-paced action of
      first-person shooting in Resident Evil: Dead Aim. In this Resident Evil: Survivor-style addition to the franchise,
      players join the dangerously brave Anti-Umbrella Pursuit Investigation Team operator Bruce McGivern as he guns
      down the baddies in an all-new storyline.
      Resident Evil: Dead Aim is designed to offer sharp graphics, steady action, and accessible gameplay. It supports
      Guncon 2 light gun controllers for a more authentic zombie-blasting experience. Remaining true to the spirit of
      the series, the game also features involved puzzle-solving, unsettling environments, and an abundance of creepy
      mutant monsters.</story>

    <story>Resident Evil - Outbreak takes a turn from previous outings in the survival horror series by featuring a
      multiplayer online component. The narrative is broken down into chapters, allowing up to four players to
      experience the world of Resident Evil together for the first time. Players initially choose from a lineup of eight
      characters, six males and two females, who each possess distinct skills or techniques. Some characters may be
      proficient in a specific style of weapon, while others may be able to open locked doors more efficiently.
      The choice of characters becomes important since teamwork is often needed to advance through the zombie-filled
      office buildings, bars, subways, and dilapidated mansions in and around the cursed Raccoon City. One player, for
      example, may have to distract a group of zombies, while another works on picking a lock or solving a puzzle as
      quickly as possible. Resident Evil: Outbreak requires a broadband connection in order to play online, but the game
      also features a single-player mode for those brave enough to go it alone.</story>

    <story>20 years ago, an alternate World War II occurred, where both Axis and Allies developed mecha technology,
      known as Armored Fighting Walkers (AFWs). As a result, battles continued in different ways and Russian forces were
      more instrumental in the eventual defeat of Japan. The end of the war has had Japan divided between the allied
      forces, similar to Germany. Japan is now split into a communist North Japan and an Democratic South Japan,
      governed separately. Without any obvious cause, Japan erupted into civil war between it's halves for four years.
      Dubbed the "Japan War", it further weakened Japan's economy and fueled resentment between people living in the
      North and the South. In 1964, Masami von Weizegger is a AFW pilot in the South Japan forces. While field testing a
      prototype AFW, it is stolen by North Japanese agents and Masami is dispatched to recover the stolen material. As
      Masami's team attempts to retrieve the AFW, they stumble into a military operation that threatens to erupt into
      all-out war.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      a female ex-Green Beret named Nikki Connors. Her goal and the player's is to stop the terrorist group known as

      Now on a quest for vengeance, Connors must complete eight missions in an attempt to infiltrate Omega 19 and put a
      stop to its nefarious deeds once and for all.
      To complete her objectives, Connors must rely on her skills in both combat and stealth. Players can use shadows to
      hide from patrolling guards, sneak up and pick their pockets to gain access to security cards, and perform silent
      attacks to disarm and disable her unsuspecting foes. Once a guard is taken down, players can pick up and hide the
      body so others won't detect it and sound the alarms. Nikki Connors can also find and use ten weapons, ranging from
      pistols and dart guns to sniper rifles and grenades, as well as devices such as infrared and x-ray goggles.

      as Virtua Tennis by having some emphasis on stamina (some players get tired faster than others, and not only run
      slower but also lose power to return the ball on longer matches) and by forcing the player to hit the ball as
      well-timed as possible - a "nice" ball (with a yellow visual cue near the racquet) will be much harder to return,

    <story>RTL Biathlon 2007 is a simulation of the winter biathlon sport, combining two disciplines: cross-country
      skiing and rifle shooting. The competition takes place on nine skiing areas. The skier moves forward by keeping a
      button pressed, which consumes energy. The amount of energy varies in different sections of the level (more when
      going downhill, less when going up), and releasing the button allows for some generation, while the skier will
      move slower. When overexerting the athlete, the energy levels move into orange and red, and a large amount of
      stamina is consumed. Other techniques include gliding (crouching when going downhill) and sprinting in certain
      areas. The shooting sections are shown from a first-person perspective. The accuracy depends on the remaining
      stamina. Players can also hold their breath to steady the rifle, but this depletes the stamina levels further.

    <story>Biathlon 2008 is the seventh part in the Biathlon series. Like its predecessor it allows you to play the
      Biathlon on your PC.

      Biathlon consists of two elements: cross-country skiing and rifle shooting on a shooting range. The racing parts
      require the player to keep an eye on his avatar's stamina so he won't be worn out. In the shooting sequences he
      has to shoot five stationary targets as quickly as possible. The game features 17 tracks to race on spread across
      13 different locations. Players can compose their own characters from different stats that determine their prowess
      in various skills. Top bi-athletes Magdalena Neuner, Kati Wilhelm, Michael Greis and Sven Fischer are also
      playable.

      Multiplayer is possible through 4-player hot seat and 2-player split-screen mode.</story>

    <story>RTL Biathlon 2009 is a simulation of the Biathlon sport. Like the real sport it is basically divided into two
      sections: skiing and shooting. During the skiing sections the player steers his athlete into the correct direction
      and watches his stamina. In the middle of the screen is a power bar which gets filled by holding the assigned
      button - if the bar is too low the athlete gets slow and if it is too high he gets tired. Practically this results
      in steady button pressing to keep it as high as possible. During the shooting sequences the player shoots on
      targets while the cursor is wobbling. He can also hold his breath for a short time to steady his aim.



      In the career mode the player divides points into four categories, e.g. speed or stamina, which influence the
      athlethe's capabilities. After successful championships he can improve these stats further. New in this instalment
      are super-powers which can be chosen at some point. When activated these give a big boost on a stat for a short
      time, e.g. "mountain skiing" boosts power when skiing uphill. These are available once per race. There are overall
      15 courses which are partly licensed.</story>

    <story>Described by a number of people as 'Gran Turismo meets SSX', Rumble Racing is an arcade-style racing game
      that includes features like various stunts, power-ups, speed boosts, and track short cuts.

      There is no story behind it. You're merely racing in one of three dozen cars (many based on real-life designs) in
      fifteen different tracks, ranging from airports to old mines to specially designed stunt arenas. Taking part in
      either races, stunt shows, or in one-on-one duels, you'll need to learn not only how to drive, but also when to
      use power-ups and where the best short cuts are. Power-ups include oil slicks to bombs to a tornado that cleans
      the course ahead of you. Through the Championship mode, you'll be able to unlock all the vehicles and tracks.

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      role-playing elements, somewhat similar to the kind of gameplay that was introduced in Shenmue games. The sequel

      serialized in Shogakukan's Big Comic Spirits magazine.
      The story begins with Shuji, a high school student in a Hokkaido coastal city, walking up to an observatory and
      reminiscing about his girlfriend, Chise; there he finds her exchange diaries that she purposefully left behind.
      The ensuing story is narrated by Shuji through flashbacks while reading Chise's diary. Chise, a fellow student in
      his class, declares her love for Shuji at the beginning of the series. However, Chise is very shy and Shuji is
      insensitive: neither know how to express their feelings very well, but they do indeed have feelings for each
      other.</story>

      However, the manga is not yet completely published in North America due to restructuring issues at ADV. The manga
      won the 2002 Kodansha Manga Award for shonen. The series began running in the United States on the cable network

      courses.
      PLOT:
      The genius principal of the private school, Heihachi Edajima, was a war hero during World War II. He trained his
      students to play an active role in politics, economics and industries in Japan and all over the world, though the

    <story>In the third installment of the Sakura Taisen series, Ichiro Ogami goes to Paris, to command the pretty girls
      of Paris Kagekidan (Flower Assault Squad), led by the lovely Erica. Just as in Japan, this special unit has a
      complex base which is disguised as a theater, since the girls of Paris Kagekidan can can act on stage as well as
      pilot huge steam-powered mechs. An unknown evil is threatening the city, so it's time for Ichiro to take command
      and save Paris from the demonic threat.

      Sakura Taisen 3 retains the basic gameplay style of the series, being a hybrid of dating-oriented role-playing
      (with timed responses during conversations with the girls, and the possibility to conquer the heart of one of
      them), and strategic turn-based battles. The game features fully 3D graphics for the battles and the map of Paris
      (although the locations in adventure mode are still 2D still images). The interface for the battles has been
      modified: you can move your mechs physically on the battle field instead of pointing and clicking, and an action
      points-based system replaces the "two different commands per turn" style of the first two games.</story>

      In this game, the player takes control over Kojirou Akechi, a detective from Japan. His sister Miki is a dancer at
      Paris Kagekidan, the same organization featured in Sakura Taisen 3. Kojirou comes from Japan to Paris to see Miki
      performing as a front-row dancer for the first time at "Les Chattes Noires". However, upon arriving he finds out
      Miki's roommate Elza has disappeared. Kojirou will have to solve the mystery, that will lead him to secret dark
      societies that are flourishing in Paris.

      Unlike the previous Sakura Taisen games, Mysterious Paris is a pure Japanese-style adventure, without any battles.
      The game progresses as a detective investigation, which involves talking to suspects, gathering clues, etc. In the
      end the player receives a title, depending on his/her PI skills. Interaction with the characters is performed
      using the same time-limit system as the previous two games: the player has to choose a response quickly, since
      silence is also considered response.</story>

      So Long, My Love. It features different setting, characters, and gameplay style compared to the first four Sakura
      Taisen titles.

      The story is set in America, and focuses on one of the new cast members of the upcoming fifth installment, a young
      Japanese-American girl named Gemini Sunrise. She has spent her childhood in Texas, but is now sent to New York.
      The Samurai Cowgirl boards her trusty friend, the horse Rodeo, and heads for the "Big Apple", to meet many new
      characters and to experience many adventures.

      The game is a radical departure from Sakura Taisen style, gameplay-wise. This is primarily an action game, where
      Gemini fights her enemies in real-time, on a horseback, in what is called "Action Rodeo Combat". The dialogues are
      still built according to the classical Sakura Taisen model, featuring multiple choices by dialogues which lead to
      different relationships between characters.</story>

      possible to use an axe to break obstacles or debris, and it's entirely possible to get caught in a backdraft when

      Equally as important as getting the fire under control is finding and rescuing survivors, helping them escape and
      reach safety, as well as searching for evidence as to how a fire started. Between missions, the player works
      together with local law enforcement to examine the evidence gathered. In addition to the main story mode, there is

    <story>Samurai Warriors is Koei's extension of the popular Dynasty Warriors series. Instead of taking place during
      the Three Kingdoms era in China, Samurai Warriors takes you back to feudal Japan, during the warring states era.
      In the game, you take control of actual historical figures such as Yukimura Sanada, Nobunaga Oda, and Hattori
      Hanzo. Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked.

      Basically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors. The main differences are things like the
      inclusion of indoor castle levels, and a greater variety of enemies. In Dynasty Warriors, enemies were basically
      either soldiers or archers. In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types
      of ninjas. In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain
      level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or
      a not as good ending. Updated graphics and a more "techno-ish" soundtrack top off the additions.</story>

      the famous Shin Sangoku Musou (Dynasty Warriors) series. As with the original Samurai Warriors, Samurai Warriors 2
      is based on the Japanese Sengoku or "Warring States" period, a time of social upheaval, political intrigue, and
      nearly constant military conflict in Japan that lasted roughly from the middle of the 15th century to the
      beginning of the 17th century.

      The game is a third person hack-and-slash. You have 26 playable characters to choose from. Once you choose your
      character you are tossed into massive real-time battles, with the object being to help claim victory for your army
      by defeating key enemy officers, or simply slaying a large amount of enemy troops, which will boost the morale of
      your army, and turn the tides of the battle.</story>

    <story>Samurai Warriors 2: Empires is an expansion to Samurai Warriors 2. It is the third Empires expansion by KOEI,
      following Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires and Dynasty Warriors 5: Empires. Similar to the other Empires games, it adds
      turn-based empire-building gameplay to the mix. Although battles are still fought using the same 3rd-person button
      mashing mechanics that the Samurai Warriors-style games are known for, players now must also choose the battles to
      maximize the growth of their burgeoning empire in Japan's Warring States era. In the Empire mode there are several
      historical battles available.

      The game also adds two previously unplayable characters, Shibata Katsuie and Sasaki Kojirō, as well as a Create
      Your Own Character mode.</story>

    <story>Samurai Gojiro Kiryuu comes to the American West in search of his brother. His journey takes him to a corrupt
      town ruled by a sinister land baron named Goldberg. Though Gojiro isn't interested in righting wrongs, he is soon
      caught up in the town's problems: killing highway robbers, protecting a woman from would-be rapists, and thwarting
      Goldberg's machinations. Focused on destroying Gojiro, Goldberg unleashes an endless stream of minions... all
      fodder for Gojiro's blade. But Goldberg has an ace up his sleeve...

      Samurai Western is a third-person action game. Gojiro's blade is more than a match for Old West weaponry as he can
      ably deflect or sidestep bullets. As Gojiro completes levels, he upgrades his skills, unlocks new swords and
      stances, and adds Western accessories to his wardrobe. Primarily a single-player game, Samurai Western has a two
      player co-op mode and unlockable characters for both modes.</story>

    <story>The game has two stories to play, one for Team Spike and one for Team Specter. Spike's story features the
      series' heroes gathering in Tokyo when they find out that Specter has teamed up with aliens and unleashed an army
      of his monkeys and giant robots to take over the world. Specter's story shows
      Specter on vacation finding out that his monkeys have started to take over the world without his permission. He
      soon finds out that a Specter impostor has taken control of his army and he must ironically save the world to get
      his minions back.

      The gameplay uses the action based style from Ape Escape: Pumped &amp; Primed and mixes it with the usual
      platforming and monkey catching. Each mission has a different goal. Sometimes you will need to defeat a boss,
      other times you will need to defeat a set of Targets, defend certain characters or weapons that will help you
      throughout the game or just capture a set number of monkeys. Each mission containing monkeys has up to 100
      available for capture and the more you capture, the more "Gotcha Points" you get.</story>

      As a member of the special operations force of your choice, you will undergo four training exercises - arms,
      physical training, siege training, and defensive tactics - before being placed into the field to deal with a
      number of hostage situations.

      The sieges, true to Davilex's knack of using real-life locations, all take place in real locations, beginning with
      10 Downing Street, and moving along to the French ElysÃ©e and the German Kanzleramt.

      Although you could be forgiven for believing that this game wants to be realistic looking at the use of real
      services and real locales, this game makes no claims as such. In fact, arcade action is the order of the day here,
      and while the real SAS, GIGN and GSG9 are busy with discreet, minimal casualty operations, here you'll be blasting

      Championship league. The main focus lies on the realistic simulation of the driving physics. During the season the
      player takes the role of one of 27 licensed athletes and compete in 13 of the race locations of the season
      2008/2009 (the Nürburgring is not in available). There are up to eight sessions per race, including free training
      and warm ups. In the garage the player can tune almost every aspect of his bike in detail. Beginners this can be
      delegated to an engineer. Of course there is also the option to play just a single racing weekend or to start in a
      quick race.

      In comparison to its predecessor there are two notable changes: driving helps for novice players and 20
      challenges. In these the player either has to solve certain problems in pre-defined situations, e.g. winning the
      race with worn out brakes or reaching checkpoints in a limited time frame.</story>

      Sony's first effort at interactive drama on PlayStation2 is a much bigger production than we'd heretofore

      for Ghost in the Shell, the Patlabor movies, and the upcoming Blood and Jin-Roh will be handling the animation
      duties, creating work of top theatrical quality for Sony's DVD adventure.
      The story involves two freelance photographers (the hero, and associate Saki Kitazawa), who happen to take a
      picture that they probably would have been better off leaving alone. At first, it seems to simply be a famous
      musician in a compromising situation, fodder for the tabloid front pages, but more powerful organizations turn out

      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels

    <story>Scooby Doo! Night of 100 Frights is loosely based upon the Scooby Doo cartoon series, and thus strays little
      from the show's basic formula. The Scooby Gang (consisting of Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy, and of course, Scooby
      Doo) attempts to unravel the mystery behind a haunted mansion where Daphne's friend's scientist father was
      working. Controlling the lovable canine himself, players must explore 12 levels spread across four different areas
      in and around the mansion.
      Within each area are dozens of obstacles that require Scooby to make carefully timed jumps, activate switches, and
      dispatch any monsters in his path. While Scooby's primary means of offense is a jumping attack, as players
      progress through the adventure new powers can be found or bought, including a football helmet which enables Scooby

    <story>A remake of the Saturn RPG-Strategy hybrid Dragon Force, in which you get to select 6 of the generals that
      rule each kingdom of the world of Legendra, and engage in a divine campaign to prevent the resurrection of an
      ancient demon.

      The game uses the standard "world map/battle view" couple of interfaces with the difference being that gameplay is
      divided in real-time phases in which you must perform all your actions in real time before your timer runs out. 2D
      animated cutscenes signal each major plot event as well as introduces new generals that can be added to your
      armada. Each general has its own army with its strengths and weakness as well as unique magic powers, plus many
      generals have feuds or alliances with other generals so you must consider weaker but friendlier generals that
      allow you to form alliances.

      For the PS2 re-release new polygonal elements have been introduced (such as a 3D world map) and the original 2D
      artwork has been cleaned up. New quests, characters and items have been included and the 2D cutscenes have been
      completely redone with complete voiceovers.</story>

    <story>This compilation is the second SEGA AGES 2500 release from the Fantasy Zone series. It contains a collection
      of every game in the series as well as two never-before released games.

      The main attraction is the new System 16 version of Fantasy Zone II, a newly-made 16-bit re-imagining of the
      original Master System game, actually programmed for the original System 16 hardware (via emulation). This
      reworking is a rather loose interpretation of the original game, billed as a "concept remake," culling elements of
      Fantasy Zone 1 and 2 and blending them with original elements to answer the question "What if Fantasy Zone II was
      developed for the arcade by the original AM team instead of for the Sega Master System by the R&amp;D team."

      The game modes from the original are the same, featuring tournament mode, where you play against the pros;
      exhibition mode for a one-on-one, best-out-of-three game; and world tour mode which now features the option of

      Sonic the Hedgehog â€“ As Sonic runs down a round tunnel, he follows the position of the player's hand. Using this
      method, the aim of the game is to gather rings and Chaos Emeralds in order to obtain the highest score at the end
      of the game. It is much like the Special Stage on Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Heroes, and especially Sonic Rush.
      Samba de Amigo â€“ Players choose a song, and then must hit 6 different targets around the screen as the 'beat
      balls' reach them in time with the music. Posing with hands over 2 of the targets, or holding one position until a
      trail of beat balls is complete, may also be required from the player.
      ChuChu Rocket! â€“ Movement over a certain target on the screen will cause a bridge to raise, which the chu-chus
      then follow to the goal. The bridge also must be dropped at certain moments to prevent KapuKapus from destroying

    <story>Sengoku Basara is a series of video games developed and published by Capcom, and a bigger media franchise
      based on it, including two anime series and an animated film. Its story is very loosely based around the many real
      characters and events of the titular Sengoku era in the history of feudal Japan.
      Sengoku Basara has several adaptations of the games to different mediums. Notably, two anime series were planned
      and written by Yasuyuki Muto. The first series, simply titled Sengoku Basara, started broadcast in April 2009. The
      series' second season, titled Sengoku Basara II, began broadcast in July 2010. Further, a movie adaptation of the
      series titled Sengoku Basara: The Last Party was released in 2011. All three anime adaptations were licenced and
      published in the United States by Funimation. A manga adaptation of the second game was created by Yak Haibara.
      The four volume series, titled Sengoku Basara 2 was published in Japan in 2007 and was later published in the
      United States in 2012 by UDON under the title Sengoku Basara: Samurai Legends. The title change was due to Sengoku
      Basara 2 not being released in the United States. Shimotsuki Kairi also created a more general adaptation in 2005
      entitled Sengoku Basara Ranse Ranbu.</story>

      after-touch.
      The game contains a total of around 350 different teams (international and club teams) and 50 preset competitions.
      If that is not enough, players can create their own custom teams. This is the career mode of the game. The

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

      whose control centre is located on Jupiter's satellite Ganymede. On the 20th of May 2114, the central AMSC
      computer stops responding to the messages from the Earth. On the 21st of May, the Jupiter's cargo ship arrives in
      the Earth's orbit according to its schedule. However, instead of minerals, the cargo ship brings modified robots,
      which can annihilate all of the Earth's orbit patrol in a few seconds. The threat of annihilation mounts over The
      Earth.</story>

    <story>Shadow of Rome is a third-person, action-adventure game with some elements of racing. The game has two types
      of gameplay: close quarters combat levels involving Agrippa and stealth-based, puzzle-solving adventure levels
      involving Octavianus.[2] There are also levels in which Agrippa competes in chariot races.[3]
      Agrippa uses various gladiator weapons to fight, including swords, maces, spears, among others.[3] Agrippa can use
      special moves such as "Red Volcano"â€”a move used to slice enemies in halfâ€” to please the crowds.[2] As a
      result, the crowd will throw down items to help Agrippa.[4] Once a weapon is used enough, it will break, and the
      player will have to find a new one inside the area.[3]
      In Octavianus' levels, the player sneaks around various locations in Rome. Octavianus cannot kill enemies, he can
      only knock them out. Other ways to pass these levels are by hiding in large pots or by stealing clothes and
      impersonating someone.[3]</story>

    <story>End-level bosses are standard fare in video games, but the bosses are the levels in this unusual adventure.
      Developed by the studio that created the PS2's critically acclaimed Ico, Shadow of the Colossus is another
      fantasy-themed puzzle adventure that's light on dialog and heavy on beautifully expressive environments.
      Players take the role of a young knight who sets out to rescue his sleeping-beauty princess from a magic-induced
      state of suspended animation. To do so, he'll need to defeat the 16 Colossi -- landscape-sized enemies so enormous
      that they can only be conquered by exploring them, platform-game style, to discover their weaknesses. Against some
      Colossi, the hero may ride his faithful steed alongside the monster, galloping at full speed just to keep up with
      its mile-long strides. Other Colossi require the player to actually climb aboard, and crawl, run, and leap across
      their massive forms to find the hidden vulnerability that can be used to bring them down.</story>

    <story>Shellshock takes you back to the years of the Vietnam war. You take on the role of a rookie soldier on his
      first tour of duty. Using a third-person perspective, you experience napalm bombardments of civilian villages,
      sneaky night missions along the river banks, claustrophobic tunnel systems and huge battles in temples and open
      fields. Most missions are played as a team, but your team members cannot die and do not influence the mission
      objectives. You will have to assassinate enemy generals, take out crucial boats and guide your team through
      unknown territory.

      The game does not have drivable vehicles, multiplayer options or extensive environmental interaction, but it
      features a particular system of dismantling the many bombs and traps: in a race against time, you have to perform
      a long key sequence in the correct order to clear the path. The atrocities on both sides are clearly shown in the
      cutscenes, filmed as through a shaky hand-camera. Either side is not afraid to abuse civilians for their cause and
      this sense of realism gives the game a rather raw edge. You can even purchase the services of hookers in the base

    <story>Shining Tears is an old-school Action RPG set in the Shining universe (previous games include Shining in the
      Darkness and the Shining Force Trilogy). You play Xion, a hero who is drawn into saving the City of Shilidia from
      a formerly peaceful neighbor due to his possession of the powerful Twin Dragon Rings. This sets the stage for an
      epic RPG storyline with fun characters and big surprises.

      Presented in beautiful hand-drawn 2D graphics and backgrounds, players may choose to go into battles from among 8
      unlockable companions, each with their own unique powers, strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the co-op system
      lets two players cooperate in battles, pulling off special combo moves and leveling up their characters together.
      Interestingly, the companion you pick changes Xion to the opposite 'soul' dark or light due to the nature of the
      Twin Dragon Rings, with correspondingly different powers. Single players have their companion AI to help them out
      of tight spots, too.</story>

    <story>Shinobido Imashime is a ninja game, resembling Tenchu at first glance. You play as a black-clad ninja called
      Gou, also known as The Raven. Gou has lost his memory, and he's not sure why he's fighting. Providing some clue to
      his exploits are Zaji, a ninja who wears an eye patch, and a mysterious "kunoichi" female ninja, whose name has
      not been revealed. Both Gou and Zaji have the same emblem on their belt, with the female ninja having a similar
      shape tattooed on her left leg. Real physics seems to be the big selling point for this game. The game uses a real
      physics engine which handles the movement of all objects, promising added realism. You'll be able to stack up
      objects in order to form a stepping ground for scaling a tall wall. Kill an enemy, and when he falls, his position
      will reflect the shape of the ground beneath him, even if that means hanging over a ledge and slowly falling off.

      Bronze. However, if the player takes too long to cross the zone, beyond the Bronze time, a reward will not be
      given. Shox doesn't feature the genre's traditional gameplay modes. Instead of time trial, single race, and career
      modes, Shox has only one: the championship mode where players take one of 24 cars through 30 different races that
      are spread across five unique leagues.</story>

    <story>Shrek 2's storyline follows a similar, but slightly different plot compared to that of the movie. Shrek and
      Fiona are on a journey to the Kingdom of Far Far Away to visit Fiona's parents. Shrek's in-laws aren't too
      thrilled that a crude ogre is married to their beloved daughter, Fiona, so the battle for acceptance ensues. The
      game also covers things not shown in the film. Plot elements are delivered primarily through a storybook interface
      (text and illustrations) shown before each level. The player is able to play as Shrek or his friends throughout
      the game, and travel through 11 levels, while being able to switch between the four characters available in each
      level. In each level, the player controls a team of four characters, and can switch between them at any point.
      Each character has a unique ability that aids them in fighting enemies or moving through the environment (for
      example, Donkey can destroy obstacles and Fiona can slow down time).</story>

      searching across the haunted town for his missing daughter Cheryl. New to the series are a depiction of Silent
      Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters
      come out, Harry must literally run for his life.

      Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and
      your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of
      dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable.

      As you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent
      Hill.</story>

    <story>Dating sims (or dating simulations) are a video game subgenre of simulation games, usually Japanese, with
      romantic elements. They are also sometimes put under the category of neoromance. The most common objective of
      dating sims is to date, usually choosing from among several characters, and to achieve a romantic relationship.
      The term 'dating sim' is also often used incorrectly in English as a generic term for romance-driven games (ren'ai
      games), a subject matter which is stereotypically associated with the visual novel genre.
      In a typical dating sim, the player controls a male avatar surrounded by female characters.</story>

      The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold
      challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven
      (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles
      where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really

    <story>Runabout 3: Neo Age is an open-ended racing game where the racing isn't restricted to strict tracks and the
      player can choose their route, as the races are mostly driving from point A to point B. Like in the previous
      games, you don't really have to drive clean and crashing everywhere while winning the race is not only allowed but
      also encouraged as there is points to be gained from destroying various objects.
      The game plays similarly to previous incarnations where you race through streets, this time destroying target
      objects and then heading towards your destination to fulfill the objective. Fun, wild and out of control, Runabout
      will appeal to masters of destruction who seek road thrills and have a desire to break any and all traffic laws
      ever drafted.
      There are over 20 different vehicles to drive with and over 30 missions which range from simple races to
      checkpoint races and "deliver the package"-missions.</story>

      When she returns in the game, she takes a walk in the forest and sees a mysterious young man. Later, she gets lost
      in the forest, and comes upon a small caf?. Inside she finds the same young man, as well as two others, and the

    <story>Metropolismania is a city building game with a Japanese anime style. The goal is to grow a town to a target
      population. This is accomplished by interacting with NPCs and becoming friends by giving them gifts and talking
      with them. Attract citizens by building up the town with offices, grocers, entertainment and farming buildings (to
      name a few).

      Rather than overlooking the environment, the player controls a character from a thirdperson perspective. Walking
      around, new constructions can be started and roads can be built. The buildings can be entered too. Side quests
      happen every level, some of which are quite strange. Expect to be involved in a smuggling ring or a cult.</story>

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run can be best described as Grand Theft Auto in Springfield.

      The player takes on the role of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa or Apu and try to uncover a mystery surrounding
      mechanical bees that are taking over Springfield, mysterious vans, and cola that can control the minds of those
      who drink it.

      Like GTA, the game follows a linear-based path through fifty plus missions. The player will have to chase cars and
      find out where they're headed, grab all the spilling cola cans before people can drink them, and chasing down
      villains before they get away.

      Throughout the course of the game, the player can unlock tons of rewards by completing missions in a set amount of
      time or performing outstanding stunts.

      All voiceovers are performed by those who act in the show, including Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Julie Kavner
      (Marge) and Yeardley Smith (Lisa).

      The game supports multiplayer action for up to four players.</story>

    <story>The Sims 2 is a 2004 strategic life simulation video game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic
      Arts. It is the sequel to the best-selling computer game The Sims.

      The game has the same concept as its predecessor: players control their Sims in various activities and form
      relationships in a manner similar to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, does not have a defined final
      goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both
      positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their
      aspirations are fulfilled. The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life
      and incorporating a 3D graphics engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built
      neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original The Sims. Strangetown's storyline is
      based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on
      Shakespearean characters.

      The Sims 2 was first released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A port to Mac OS X was released on June
      17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console
      versions have been released. The Sims 2 is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering
      The Sims 2 from the Ovi Store. A sequel, The Sims 3, was released in June 2009.

      The Sims 2 was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time.
      During April 2008, The Sims 2 website announced that 100 million copies of The Sims series had been sold. The Sims
      2 was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. By March 2012,
      The Sims 2 had sold over six million PC copies, and 13 million over all platforms, making it one of the
      best-selling PC games of all-time.</story>

    <story>The game begins on a boat after the player creates a crew of characters. The crew can consist of one to six
      Sims. After the crew's creation, a slide-show starts of some mobile phone pictures that are taken showing the trip
      and also showing the storm that wrecks the ship. The player's starting Sim wakes up on First Beach on Shipwreck
      Island. The Sim finds books detailing the goals the Sim must follow to survive on the islands and escape. Shortly
      after exploring Shipwreck Island, the Sim discovers a second island, Airplane Island, this one considerably larger
      and more interesting than the first, and builds a raft to reach the new location. After arriving on the island,
      the Sim is reunited with some of their lost crew. The player then has the option to form a tribe of Sims if the
      relationship is strong enough. While exploring Airplane Island, the player finds radio parts that are required to
      complete a goal later in the game. A third island, Volcano Island, can be reached once the player finds the second
      beach on Airplane Island and builds a canoe. On Volcano Island, the player will discover the remains of the llama
      people. The player has the option to return to civilization on this island. They can either build a boat or travel
      to the volcano's summit and use the radio parts to send an SOS signal to a nearby ship. The player can also repair
      a broken ceremonial forge on Volcano Island that will cause a fourth island, Crystal Island, to rise out of the
      sea, however this is optional and is not required for the player to escape the island. The game contains many
      discoverable secrets, including secret areas such as Hidden Lagoon and the Secret Pirate's Cove. These areas can
      only be accessed once the player has gathered objects such as hieroglyphics and treasure map pieces, however this
      is a relatively extensive process.</story>

    <story>Game play in the Sims may be classified as the following:

      [1] Life Simulation
      This revolves around simulating their day-to-day lives. From eating, sleeping, entertainment, socializing and
      romance, you are in complete control of their actions if you choose to. Each Sim has a statistics that may be
      developed. Some of which identify certain desires the Sim in mention may require. Your role in simulating their
      lives is primarily to keep them happy by fulfilling their desires.

      Controlling the Sims people is optional, as they follow their own Artificial Intelligence unless commanded
      otherwise by the player.

      [2] The Architect
      Designing and furnishing your home is an integral part of the game play. Pre-generated houses may be purchased at
      the beginning of the game, or you can design and build your future home from scratch. Furnishing consists of
      acquiring various items that may be manipulated by your Sims to fulfill their needs. Designing houses and
      furnishing costs money, which may be obtained through jobs.

      [3] Character Development and Careers
      Adult Sims may acquire jobs to pay for the many necessities of living a simulated life. There are several
      different job track available, from Entertainment, Law Enforcement, Politics and even a life of crime! Promotion
      in a job requires the Sim to advance in certain statistics (e.g. Charisma, Strength) which may be done so by
      manipulating the various items available for purchase.</story>

    <story>Get the party started with SingStar Party; Sony London's second iteration of its popular karaoke-inspired
      vocals game developed exclusively for the PlayStation 2. Though gameplay is nearly identical to the previous
      installment (players are judged on their ability to sing with the correct tone, rhythm, and pitch), a host of new
      features populate this sequel as well. Boasting more than 30 new tracks and the ability to import 30 more from the
      original SingStar, the game also supports an all-new competitive Duet Mode, EyeToy compatibility, and a Shuffle
      Token feature for a more personalized selection of theme songs. Available only in the European territories.

    <story>SingStar is a competitive music video game series, developed by London Studio and published by Sony Computer
      Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 video game consoles. SingStar allows 1-2 people to sing
      karaoke via microphone peripherals in time with on-screen music. The first game in the series, SingStar, was
      released in Europe and Oceania in 2004. As of 2008, over seventy titles in the SingStar series have been released
      PAL region territories,[1] in addition to a small number of releases in North America.

      The main difference between each SingStar title is the game's track list. Each edition of the game includes up to
      thirty songs on disc, with PlayStation 3 versions of the game allowing additional songs to be purchased from an
      online service. Players can remove a game disc from the console during gameplay and insert a new disc, giving them
      access to a new selection of songs. Most SingStar titles are loosely based upon musical genres, such as rock or
      pop music (SingStar Rocks! and SingStar Pop respectively). SingStar games are sometimes localised for release in
      different regions, with customised track lists to suit foreign markets and territories. The first artist-specific
      SingStar game (SingStar Die Toten Hosen) was released in Germany in 2007,[2] with ABBA, Queen, Take That, Mecano
      and Vasco Rossi receiving similar releases in subsequent years.</story>

    <story>SingStar is a competitive music video game series, developed by London Studio and published by Sony Computer
      Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 video game consoles. SingStar allows 1-2 people to sing
      karaoke via microphone peripherals in time with on-screen music. The first game in the series, SingStar, was
      released in Europe and Oceania in 2004. As of 2008, over seventy titles in the SingStar series have been released
      PAL region territories,[1] in addition to a small number of releases in North America.

      The main difference between each SingStar title is the game's track list. Each edition of the game includes up to
      thirty songs on disc, with PlayStation 3 versions of the game allowing additional songs to be purchased from an
      online service. Players can remove a game disc from the console during gameplay and insert a new disc, giving them
      access to a new selection of songs. Most SingStar titles are loosely based upon musical genres, such as rock or
      pop music (SingStar Rocks! and SingStar Pop respectively). SingStar games are sometimes localised for release in
      different regions, with customised track lists to suit foreign markets and territories. The first artist-specific
      SingStar game (SingStar Die Toten Hosen) was released in Germany in 2007,[2] with ABBA, Queen, Take That, Mecano
      and Vasco Rossi receiving similar releases in subsequent years.</story>

      leading a blind girl and a teacher and student duo to make your escape from the nightmare town. Forbidden Siren
      incorporates haunting environments, eerily realistic characters complete with motion-captured facial expressions,

    <story>SkyGunner is a third person flight combat game, with its emphasis on action. Players choose to take the role
      of either Ciel, Femme, or Copain, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill.
      Players can turn the plane's direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, and use afterburners.
      Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: "Look Targeting" and "Weapon Lock".
      Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy at the center of the camera and can be switched between at any
      time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to shoot them.
      Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy
      group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that
      group.

      The primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary
      weapons are also available, that includes Firework Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow
      and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to
      detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary
      weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are
      also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and
      Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to
      the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission
      events.</story>

    <story>Sled Storm is a series of snowmobile racing video games published and developed by Electronic Arts and
      released in North America on July 31, 1999 and in Europe on August 11, 1999. It gained critical acclaim due to its
      original concept of being one of the first snowmobile racing titles. The series currently consists of two games,
      both of which are named simply Sled Storm.

      The game features snowmobiles (referred to as sleds), stunts and fourteen snow-covered courses consisting of
      slippery slopes, inclement weather and treacherous cliffs. Six racers were selectable from the outset and two more
      were unlockable, each of which had different snowmobile handling attributes.</story>

      thieves with Bentley the turtle and Murray the purple, hippo-like creature, which each have their own role within
      the game.

      Sly is the fastest, most agile member of the band of thieves and still is the character you play with the most.
      But certain missions require the special abilities of Bentley, who is smart and can drop bombs, as well shoot
      enemies from a distance. Other missions require the muscles of Murray, who can lift nearly everything, including
      enemies.

      The main goal of the game is the retrieval of a number of clockwork pieces from different locations around the
      world. Each theft has to be prepared with a number of sub-missions which have to be completed before the 'real
      thing' can begin.</story>

      (Sly, Bentley and Murray) to the fortress that houses the treasures of Sly's family. Although they are still weary
      from the adventures in the previous game, they have to get up and face the new threat that could mean the end of
      Sly's business and the loss of his family heritage. The game itself is a lot like the previous games: Sly sneaks,
      jumps, and swings himself around the levels, collecting various items, defeating bad guys and ultimately taking on
      the boss character. The other members of the gang step in on the action once in a while but the Sly centric

    <story>Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of
      an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end
      of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been
      conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more
      about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are.

      The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and
      things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly
      well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target.
      It can be played with a friend in local 2-player co-op. Players can revive each other.</story>

      game introduces five new playable characters, the Babylon Rogues and the E-10000 series. A sequel to Sonic Riders,
      entitled Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity, was released in 2008 for the Wii and PlayStation 2, followed by the
      Kinect-required game Sonic Free Riders for the Xbox 360 in 2010. This was the last Sonic the Hedgehog game for the

      William the Just with a future incarnation of the Reaver in Blood Omen. Kain hands Raziel the material Soul
      Reaver, and the spectral Soul Reaver Raziel has coils around it. Raziel is faced with a dilemma: kill Kain and
      submit to fate, or establish his free will by refusing. Raziel avoids dealing the death blow, changing time again
      before Kain vanishes. Raziel finds Moebius in his timestreaming chamber and forces him to send him to the past

    <story>25 years after Space Invaders was released, Taito has decided to bring us a special anniversary edition that
      includes all the versions of Space Invaders that were ever released in the arcades, plus two extra game modes.
      These include:
      Space Invaders - monochrome version: The original, as first appeared in 1978. Move your ship left or right,
      shooting at oncoming invaders, while dodging theirs. Shoot the flying saucer that goes across the screen for extra
      points. Four barriers protect you from invaders' shots, but will be destroyed after several hits. Once you shoot
      every invader on screen, you have to do it again and again. The game ends when all lives are lost.

      Space Invaders - color version: Same version as above, but in color.

      Space Invaders - cellophane version: Five strips of cellophane (cyan, green, yellow, blue, red) are placed across
      the game screen, in an attempt to block out the two black areas.

      Space Invaders - upright version: Space Invaders in color, but a background has been added, and contains a planet
      and some stars.

      Space Invaders doubles: Two players can play at the same time. Lives are separate, so if one players loses all
      their lives, the other keeps on playing.

      Space Invaders Part II: Known as Space Invaders Deluxe in the US. The differences between the original and this
      game is that there are two different flying saucers: one is steadily visible and another blinks. Different points
      are awarded for each one that is killed. Also, from wave two onwards, invaders can be split into two when shot,
      and the flying saucers drop alien reinforcements. Also available as a cocktail cabinet.
      Space Invaders VS: Two-player game. The screen is split is split into two, with each side reserved for each
      player. Invaders occupy both sides. The object of the game is to kill these invaders, so that you can destroy the
      ship at the top of the screen that belongs to your opponent. Matches are determined before the start of the game.
      You can have a CPU opponent.

      Space Invaders 3D: Everything on screen appears in 3D. Instead of bullets, not only do invaders shoot arrows at
      you, but they can launch fireballs at you. You lose a life when you come in contact with these. As always, flying
      saucers go across the screen, but will then fly directly toward you. When these saucers are hit, you automatically
      receive a power-up that will help you kill the invaders.
      Before you start each game, you can adjust the view of which you can play. One view shows the cabinet as it is
      played as if you are standing in front of the machine itself, while another allows you to play the game in
      full-screen mode. The sounds of Space Invaders serves as the background music, but this can be changed to music
      from various Taito games, such as Bubble Bobble, Elevator Action, The Fairyland Story, Darius, and several others.
      Other options let you choose the number of lives to start off with and adjust the number of points needed to gain
      extra lives.

      Along with the games, you can also view promotional material, as well as any development sheets for the original
      game.</story>

      hordes of enemies in large environments, while working with allies. Use ultra-violent special attacks to mow down
      entire groups of foes at once, with ridiculously bloody effect.

      The game has a fast-paced, arcade-like, mission-based gameplay. In each mission, you must succeed in minor goals
      like killing the generals of the opposition, escorting sappers to blow up enemy siege weaponry and preventing the
      enemy from making to behind your borders. The storyline progresses through cutscenes, shown in-between each
      mission.

      Depending on how you succeed in your mission, you get "tokens", which you can use to upgrade the health, damage or
      power of your character. The player is capable of doing special moves, which can be learned throughout the game.
      Some of the special moves gain their powers through the spartan gods, that aid the player in his battle. During
      the game, you can find different weapons like swords, bows and spears, and of course, shields.</story>

    <story>Speed Racer is based on the Wachowski Brothers film of the same name, which is in turn based on a Japanese
      anime series from the 1960's. The main storyline is based around winning the World Racing League Cup. This video
      game adaptation focuses on the racing aspect of the film and it is the first third-party game for the Wii to
      support the Wii Wheel. More than 15 characters from the film are represented as playable drivers in the game and
      the vehicles from the film can be selected from the game's menu. Maximum speeds during the races can exceed 350
      MPH.

      The race tracks feature loops, jumps, corkscrews, and many twists and turns. They all have a high-tech look with
      bright colors. The game offers split-screen multiplayer in addition to single player races. Drivers can engage in
      combat during races by employing "car-fu" manoeuvres such as "tail toss", "boost bash", "smack down", "round
      house", and "torpedo", among others.</story>

    <story>Spider-Man is a level based action game, with the player as Spider-Man. Half the levels are indoors, but the
      rest of the levels are outside among the sky-scrapers of New York and require him to web-sling from building to
      building, however Spider Man cannot land on the ground, as he will die if he gets too close. Levels are in
      "sections" with a different enemy for each, each section lasting about 3 levels. Each level, except for the last
      two, has a bonus screen after it. Generally, there are the bonuses "Time" (clear level in a set time), "Perfect"
      (Not take damage/detected) and "Style" (use as many combos as possible). Other level-specific ones are "Secrets"
      (Uncover a secret area), "Combat" (Defeat all enemies). Players can gain, depending on difficulty, points on
      completing these tasks.</story>

      and one-by-one, the villains begin disappearing. Meanwhile, Spider-Man is rescued by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.,
      who informs him that the meteor which brought the Venom symbiote to Earth had broken up in the Earth's atmosphere
      and five more pieces had landed in numerous locations across the globe. Fury sends Spider-Man to retrieve the

      from the mind control, they promise to aid him in finding the villain responsible. As Spider-Man progresses, he
      obtains more allies such as Black Cat, Iron Fist, Lizard (not portrayed as a villain), and Blade. He discovers
      that the evil genius is Mysterio, who intends to use his army to take over the world, using each shard of the

      for each group including: Droidekas (CIS), Jet Troopers (Republic), Dark Troopers (Imperials), and Wookie
      Smugglers (Rebels).

      vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your

    <story>Starsky &amp; Hutch is an arcade racing game based on the popular TV series from the 70s, released to tie in

      'Huggy Bear' Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment
      looking for action and trouble.

      Like the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky &amp; Hutch are actually shooting a TV show,
      and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or
      bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1
      for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to
      play through.

      The overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal's car. There is always a secondary
      target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and
      skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the
      levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers.</story>

    <story>Stella Deus is a tactical RPG of Japanese origin. It follows the party-based conventions of genre landmarks
      such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre Battle, or Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth, but features realistically rendered
      characters and rich, 3D environments. The game's sophisticated, philosophy-infused storyline involves an evil
      mist, appropriately known as the "Miasma," which has gradually covered the fantasy-style game world, bringing
      death and despair. Players lead a team of adventures who seek to cleanse the world of the cursed fog, though each
      for his or her own reason, and hoping to reach this shared goal by a different means.</story>

    <story>Street Dance is a game that uses the PS2 dance mat or the standard PS2 controller in a test of co-ordination
      and fitness. As is typical of this kind of game, arrows appear rhythmically on screen and the player must hit the
      corresponding button in time with these arrows and the music, points are awarded for accuracy.

      There are three difficulty levels. Easy, which uses four direction arrows; Medium and Expert both use eight
      direction arrows. In addition to the standard dance contest, the game has a workout mode which, when given the
      player's weight, calculates the projected calories burned during a dance. There's also a 'recorder' mode where the
      player can create their own dance routines.

      The basic game is for a single player, but with two dance mats connected the game supports a multiplayer mode for
      up to eight players.</story>

      Rats assisted in the development of Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling so the game has the same physics engine, but has
      a more fantasy-oriented theme. Strike Force features 14 places to Bowl (12 in Fast Lanes) and 8 Playable
      characters. There are only 7 locations, but each has its own "nighttime" variant which is unlocked as a secret
      stage. It also features Golf Mode, Challenge Mode, Skins, and Tournaments. There are also 14 different bowling

    <story>Stuntman: Ignition is a game based on the original 2002 Stuntman game. Players assume the role of a Hollywood
      stunt driver working for a movie studio. Each level is based upon a movie and players will have to drive through
      the level, earning points by performing stunts. After the end of each level, players can review their performance
      by watching the movie trailer that was created.

      There are six movies to choose from, each with different settings, goals and challenges: Aftershock, Whoopin and a
      Hollerin' II, Strike Force Omega, Overdrive, Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger. Each movie consists of 6
      scenes where the goals set by the director must be followed. To progress, a successful series of stunts is
      required, but the amount of points can be increased by linking them together and adding extra danger by drifting,
      getting airborne, or getting close to other cars and obstacles.

      The multiplayer portion offers 2 game modes. In Backlot Battle players have to perform as many stunts as possible
      in a set amount of laps. Backlot Race offers straightforward racing where boost is earned through stunts. The PS2
      version only offers offline gameplay, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have multiplayer supported through the

      changes the story accordingly, and also alters the player's creature form. Everything from the first The Suffering
      has been refined and turned up a notch for the sequel.

      The story picks up right where the first game left off. The player once again takes on the role of Torque, former
      death row inmate with a mysterious past. Now returning to his home town of Baltimore, Torque must confront the
      mysterious Blackmore, the man who may or may not have killed Torque's family. But it won't be easy, as the hideous

    <story>An orphan boy was brought up in a noble household on the island of Razril, part of a federation known as the
      Island Nations, which is threatened by their powerful neighbor, the Kooluk Empire. When the boy grows up, he
      trains together with other young people, hoping to become a knight in the Gaien order. One day, during an escort
      mission, the knights' ship is attacked by pirates. Through a series of events, the hero is branded with the Rune
      of Punishment, one of the twenty-seven legendary True Runes. While devastating the enemies, this rune is also
      bound to deplete its bearer's life. Blamed for the death of his commander, who was unable to withstand the power
      of the rune, the young knight is exiled from his homeland. He must find a way to use his powers for the good of
      the Island Nations, fight against a Kooluk invasion, and restore his honor in the process.

      Suikoden IV is a prequel to the entire series. The events of the game take place a hundred and fifty years before
      those of the first game, and the region of the Suikoden universe they occur in are the islands south of Toran. The
      game retains many classic features of the series: the ability to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny);
      building and customization of army headquarters (this time a large ship instead of a castle); emphasis on
      political issues in the story; the ability to equip runes of various kinds in combat that allow the usage of magic
      spells, etc.

      The amount of active combatants in the party has been reduced from six to four in this installment. Once again,
      there are three types of combat in the game: the most frequent turn-based party-vs.-party combat, duels, and
      tactical battles, which now take place on sea. The player can customize the the naval forces by choosing captains
      and commanding officers, and assigning to them runic elements. Each element has strengths and weaknesses to
      another one, and the player must use them tactically to gain the upper hand. Ship placement on the battle grid and
      attack angles play a role as well.

      New to the series is ship navigation - instead of exploring an overworld on foot, the player navigates a ship,
      discovering new lands and islands. Also for the first time in the series there is voice acting, a fully rotatable
      camera, and the possibility to navigate the main character from first-person perspective.</story>

    <story>The Sum of all Fears is a first person shooter game reminiscent of the Rogue Spear series. It's from the same
      development team and the look and feel is alike, although it's not as tactical as Rogue Spear.

      The game's story is build around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite
      fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the
      best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the
      world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a
      global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are
      included.

      Unlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns
      plus grenades . You can't make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member,
      shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other
      shooter games, you can't survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can
      switch to another team member.</story>

    <story>Summer Athletics: The Ultimate Challenge is a collection of sports events based on the Olympic Summer Games.
      It features 26 sports divided into seven disciplines: Swimming, jumping, throwing, cycling, running, platform
      diving and archery. The handling is similar for all of them: rhythmic motions to keep the athlete moving and quick
      time events (pressing a button when it gets displayed on the screen) for performing certain actions. The mentioned
      rhythmic motions depend on the input device the player uses, e.g. at the swimming event the player needs to press
      two buttons alternately when using a keyboard and rotate the analog sticks when using a gamepad. The game features
      a basic career mode where the player gains a fixed amount of experience points after every event which an be
      reinvested into improved stats. There is also a optional arcade mode where the players have so-called boosts to
      their disposal to improve their athlete's performance for a short time.</story>

      start falling and if multiple of the same kind touch each other they vanish. The goal of a level is to get rid of
      every fruit.

      There are 50 levels and four playing modes: arcade (solving as many levels as possible in a limited time), time
      challenge (solving one level with the fastest time), training (no clock) and a split-screen mode for two players.

    <story>Our four heroes from Super Monkey Ball - Aiai, Meemee, Baby and Gongon - were enjoying a typical day, when
      they saw a flying machine crash down on a nearby island. Soon, they discovered that the mysterious Naysayers have
      appeared, spreading discord and unhappiness all over the island. And to top it all off, the prince and princess of
      the neighboring islands have gone missing on Jungle Island - if they aren't found and returned, there's sure to be
      trouble! Can our heroes restore order to Monearth?

      Super Monkey Ball Adventure takes the monkey rolling madness of the previous games and puts a story-based spin on
      it. Choosing from one of the four monkeys, Players roll their way around the various islands of Monearth, talking
      to citizens and performing the tasks they request (such as delivering sandwiches, finding a missing baby, rescuing
      rare flowers, and more) to cheer them up.</story>

    <story>This game is basically a fusion of Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2 for the PS2 and XBox. All of the levels from
      those two games are available in this collection, and all of the minigames are already unlocked and included.
      Formerly only available to GameCube players, the Super Monkey Ball series has made it to the PS2 and Xbox after a
      wait of almost 3 and a half years. The game itself plays very much like the old arcade game Marble Madness. You
      control a monkey in a ball, and you have to navigate it through many perilous labyrinths to the finish. In the
      previous two games you had limited lives/tries, but here you have infinite lives, which makes it all the easier.

    <story>A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style
      art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble
      mixed-media novels or tableau vivant stage plays.
      In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist
      predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV),
      which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside
      Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels
      and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.

    <story>Memories Off is a Japanese visual novel developed by KID originally released in Japan on September 30, 1999
      for the PlayStation, and was later released for the PC, Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and the PlayStation Portable.
      Subsequent versions incorporated new content not found in the original version, such as a second part of the
      story, Memories Off: Pure, originally released as a separate game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color on April 27, 2000.
      The gameplay in Memories Off follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of
      interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the six female main characters.
      Memories Off has made several transitions to other media. A manga anthology was published in August 2000 by
      Enterbrain. It was followed by an original video animation series produced by E&amp;G Films released on three DVDs
      and VHSs between November 11, 2001 and March 8, 2002. Three novels and a drama CD were also produced.
      The gameplay in Memories Off requires little player interaction as much time is spent on reading the text that
      appears on the lower portion of the screen, representing either dialogue between characters, or the inner thoughts
      of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a "decision point", where he or she is given the
      chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a
      minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot
      will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to
      experience, one for each of the heroines in the story except Ayaka. To view all five plot lines, the player will
      have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in an alternate
      direction.
      Tomoya Mikami is a seventeen-year-old Japanese high school student attending the Sumisora Academy. The second year
      of his studies begins, and he boards the train that goes to the campus. On the way, however, Tomoya encounters
      Yue, a childhood friend who might have developed romantic feelings towards him. The matters become further
      complicated when Tomoya meets an attractive new transfer student, forcing him to sort out his preferences and
      abandon his usual cynical approach to love.
      Memories Off is a visual novel. Most of the game consists of text superimposed on still anime-style visuals. The
      interaction is restricted to occasional choices the player must make when prompted by the story development.
      Depending on these decisions the plot may advance into any of the six distinct branches, leading to different
      endings.
      MANUFACTURER'S DESCRIPTION:

    <story>Superman Returns is based on the movie of the same name. You control the man himself as he flies around
      Metropolis, saves citizens and fights natural disasters, fires and supervillains alike.

      You have constant access to Superman's powers including heat vision, freeze breath, invulnerability and flight at
      supersonic speeds, though the former two are limited by a stamina bar. Unusually for this genre, Superman himself
      does not take damage and the challenges are all built around saving others from harm.

      Combat is accomplished through melee (you learn new combos as you progress in the game) as well as direct
      application of Superman's heat vision and freeze breath. Additionally, you may pick up objects, from the Daily
      Planet globe to tanker trucks, to throw at villains. You can also rip down a lamppost and use it as a club.

      Metropolis is presented as a wide open world where you can fly anywhere and perform any of the side missions at
      any given time. Besides the main story missions, there are 200 kittens to rescue and many fires to put out.

      The basic game is broken up a bit with two rather different sequences. There is a race around the city against
      Myxyzptlk and a Bizarro mode, in which you must destroy the city.</story>

    <story>SWAT Siege is a shooting gallery title, reminiscent of games such as Cabal and Blood Bros. The player
      controls a SWAT agent tasked with clearing each level of all enemies. Like in Cabal, the player can only move left
      and right while also moving an aiming reticule across the screen to shoot enemies which appear from behind cover
      and at windows. The screen also scrolls slightly to the left and the right, and being hit once results in death.
      Score and weapon bonuses are awarded for shooting the enemies and they fly towards the player to be collected.

      SWAT Siege is a very complex low-budget shooting. According to what the title might suggest, the player takes the
      role of a member of the SWAT team (Special Weapons And Tactics), taking the fight to endanger the safety of
      criminals. This product is the work of British studies developer Phoenix Games. The company has prepared a number
      of other shootings, including Sniper Assault and Air Raid 3 . SWAT Siege was developed exclusively for the
      PlayStation 2.

      The single player campaign has to offer over a dozen missions that clears up in a strictly determined by the order
      manufacturers. Wszytkich common feature of these stages is that they are played in urban areas. The player, in
      particular, must therefore be wary of those enemies that are hidden inside buildings.</story>

    <story>Syberia II is a 2004 adventure game conceived by BenoÃ®t Sokal and developed by MC2-MicroÃ¯ds, and a
      continuation to Syberia. It is a third-person puzzle-solving game. Stylistically identical to the first Syberia,
      Syberia II improves upon the first game by introducing more realistic character animation. The game includes a
      recap of the first chapter, so does not require the player to have experienced the first game.</story>

    <story>Taiko Drum Master is an entry in Namco's Taiko No Tatsujin rhythm game series and the first to have a Western
      release. As in other rhythm games, the goal is to interact with a special controller according to scrolling
      onscreen prompts timed to music. This game comes bundled with the TaTaCon drum controller, a miniature version of
      a Japanese taiko drum with sensors in the middle and on the sides.

      In-game actions are indicated by scrolling circle icons. Red circles indicate hitting the center of the drum,
      while blue circles require the player to hit the edge. On big circles, the player can hit both center or edge
      sensors for bonus points. Finally, yellow lines and balloons require the player to perform drum rolls.

      The game comes with a varied set of tunes: from covered pop hits like Material Girl and ABC to music from other
      Namco games such as Katamari Damacy and Dragon Spirit and even television theme songs. In addition, there are also
      several mini-games included on the disc that use the TaTaCon for more esoteric purposes, such as watermelon eating
      and wolf-stacking.</story>

    <story>The fourth installment in Koei's P.T.O. series brings strategic naval combat to the PS2. There are two levels
      of play: global strategy and resource management are handled with a turn-based system on a world map while
      individual battles are fought using a real-time system on a much smaller scale.

      The campaign can be played as the Americans, British, Japanese, or Germans, starting either in September 1939 or
      December 1941. If a players chooses to be American or Japanese with a 1939 start date, they will sit on the
      sidelines and watch the war until December 1941, but they will still be able to gather resources and spend them to
      build units or develop technologies. Players can also concoct "what-if" scenarios by changing which countries
      belong to which powers: for example, one could play an Alliance of America and Germany against an Axis of Japan
      and Great Britain, or even play three-on-one for more of a challenge.</story>

    <story>An ancient prophecy foretells that the Moon Juju, the kind protector of the Pupanunu people, would be
      weakened by the evil Tlaloc, an embittered Pupanunu shaman, so he could turn the Pupanunu people into sheep as
      revenge for not being made high shaman in favor of another shaman, Jibolba. The prophecy also mentions a great and
      mighty warrior who would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu people.

      Having escaped Tlaloc's spell, Jibolba believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy and prepares
      to send him off; however, it appears that Lok has been turned into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice,
      Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok.
      Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows the wielder to communicate with powerful Juju spirits
      to assist him, while he finds Lok.

      Tak returns with the Rattle to find that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak
      collect 100 magic Yorbels and Lok's spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to successfully resurrect Lok. An
      unfortunate side-effect of the resurrection, however, is a severe case of diarrhea. Tak obtains the Moon Stones
      instead while Lok recovers, restoring the Moon Juju to full strength.

      The Moon Juju reveals that the warrior of the prophecy is not Lok, but Tak, as he has already fulfilled almost
      everything the prophecy predicted. Using his arsenal of Juju spells, Tak defeats Tlaloc and turns him into a
      sheep, finally fulfilling the prophecy.</story>

    <story>Based on the newer anime styled FOX cartoon of the same name, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles features Leonardo,
      Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello as green ninjas. Living in the sewers, they creep out when nobody is looking
      to fight for truth, justice and another slice of pizza. Fighting against the public face of inventor Baxter
      Stockman and the more shadowy figure of Shredder and his Foot Clan, these Ninja Turtles will get the chance to
      make their opponents eat shell!

      The game is a 3D beat-em-up with multiple players. The game sprites all resemble the cartoony look of the TV show
      and each turtle features unique moves, sound bytes and fighting style all his own. Ninja Turtle moves include a
      weaker/quicker attack, a stronger/slower attack, Ninja Shuriken and a Jump-Kick. There is a story mode for one or
      two players, and there is also a versus mode where two players can fight head to head. In the versus mode, players
      can fight as all 4 turtles, Splinter, Casey Jones, Hamato Yoshi, The Turtlebot, Hun, Oroku Saki, and Shredder. A
      Challenge mode is unlockable by defeating Oroku Saki with any Turtle in the Story Mode, which needs to be complete
      to unlock Hamato Yoshi and his dojo.</story>

    <story>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee is a 3D fighting game based on the 2003 animated series. The
      combat system is similar to the earlier games based on that series, but unlike them, it is a competitive vs.
      fighting game. It is not a traditional one-on-one fighter, but an arena-based, four-player game - somewhat along
      the lines of Power Stone.

      There are two game modes. There is a single-player adventure mode in which you must guide one of ten characters
      (including six unlockables) through a series of 100 bouts that have you either beating up enemies, or, in a few
      cases, dodging bombs for a set amount of time. Completion of these portions unlocks the additional characters,
      bonus characters and stages for melee mode.

      Melee mode is the multiplayer portion. It has ten basic and twelve unlockable characters, and nine basic and
      fifteen unlockable stages. There are four game types which mirror popular types from first-person shooters. There
      is a deathmatchesque knock-out mode, where the goal is to score the most KOs. (Players respawn after being KOed.)
      There is also a Last Man Standing mode, where the goal is to be the only player left when the others are KOed, a
      King of the Hill, where you must stand on a glowing patch of ground and defend it from other players, and a Keep
      away mode, where you must hold a treasure chest and avoid other players who are trying to beat you up and take it.

    <story>TMNT3 puts more of a focus on teamwork, character development and control than any other console Turtles game
      to date. Gamers can play as their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience points
      along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful, well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These
      experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied,
      powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which
      ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at
      the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features
      such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes
      depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3
      features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and
      strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge
      or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4
      players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled
      through AI. All the Turtles can participate in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to
      the AI.</story>

      promises to deliver the next generation of blistered fingers and bleary eyes as it brings players the ultimate,
      most visually stunning fighting experience ever seen in a Tekken game.
      Tekken 5 brings back the popular cast of characters from the previous games along with three new characters for a

      players to use fight money to customize their character with various accessories such as hats, glasses and an

      Mishima Zaibatsu headquarters. Jin emerges as the victor in this battle and continues to defeat Heihachi, his
      grandfather - but spares both Kazuya and Heihachi's lives in honour of his mother who loved peace. Soon after
      Jin's departure, a swarm of Jacks arrive at Honmaru and begin to attack Heihachi and Kazuya - and in order to
      escape, Kazuya thrusts Heihachi into the swarm of Jacks. A great explosion destroys Honmaru, and a man watching
      from afar reports, "Heihachi Mishima is dead." While many presume the death of Heihachi Mishima will end the reign
      of Mishima Zaibatsu, an announcement is made for the fifth King of Iron Fist Tournament, with an unknown
      replacement to Heihachi leading the organization. The fight begins once again.</story>

    <story>Telly Addicts is a game for one or two people based on the UK TV series of the same name that was aired in
      the mid to late 1980's. The game follows the format of the television series in that there are six rounds of
      multiple choice questions all of which are based on old television programs, each correctly answered question
      scores a point and in the multiplayer game the player with the most points wins. The rounds in the game are:
      Screen Test - Here the player is presented with six TV screens from which they must select three. After each
      selection a picture is revealed and an associated TV trivia question is asked.
      Classic Clips - This shows a short video excerpt from a television program after which three related questions are
      asked.
      Spotlight Round - here we have five questions which must all be answered within ten seconds
      Reveal Round - This starts with a grainy picture that gradually becomes clearer, the clearer the tincture,
      however, the fewer points are scored.
      Guess The Year - The player is shown a picture and is asked a question such as "When did this first appear on
      TV?", as an aid they are given the decade and just need to select the appropriate year. This is then followed by a
      couple of related trivia questions.
      Randomiser - A spinner selects a category and the player must answer a related question.
      The game features the original presenter, Noel Edmonds who introduces each round and each question and, of course,

      PS2 in America) is a construction and management simulation game, and is a sequel to the 1994 video game Theme
      Park. Theme Park World was developed by Bullfrog Productions and released by Electronic Arts in 1999. Initially
      developed for Windows, it was later ported to PlayStation and PlayStation 2, as well for Macintosh computers.[2]
      The Mac version was published by Feral Interactive. A PC expansion, titled Theme Park World: Gold Edition, adds
      several new rides and attractions.

      Although it has no connection with Maxis' Sim titles, both Maxis and Bullfrog are owned by Electronic Arts, so it
      was identified as part of the Sim series by Electronic Arts. It was followed by Theme Park Inc (also known as Sim
      Coaster) in 2000/2001.</story>

    <story>This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts' Tiger Woods PGA Tour
      franchise. Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has
      a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved
      GameFace character creation.

      Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal
      Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to generate digital
      doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and
      mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where
      you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields
      more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with
      different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball
      has been struck without watching where the ball lands.

      PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to
      go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game.
      The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.</story>

    <story>The 2008 edition in the Tiger Woods PGA series introduces enhancements and improvements to the previous
      version without major graphical or gameplay changes. There are new courses (Xbox 360/PS3: 5 new, 16 in total -
      PS2: 6 new, 18 in total) and different licensed professional golf players to choose from (21 on the Xbox 360/PS3 -
      23 on the PS2/Wii).

      The Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and Windows versions allow players to import photos to create in-game faces on the
      characters based on custom images, using the Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation EyeToy, PlayStation Eye or a
      webcam. Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be
      improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well
      in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional
      golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.

      The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at
      Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the
      player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed
      and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point
      timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's
      performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the
      confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to
      lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.

      The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom
      challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).

      On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It
      can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes:
      Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for
      analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the
      Wii is a Miniputt mode.</story>

    <story>Crisis Zone is a spin-off of the popular Time Crisis arcade shooters, released in 29 March 1999 in the
      arcades.

      A PlayStation 2 (PS2) remake of the game was released in 2004 in the UK and the US with more detailed polygons and
      textures, higher difficulty, redone voice acting and an additional mission taking place six months after the
      Crisis Zone Arcade mode.

      The PS2 port is compatible with the GunCon (G-Con 45 in Europe) and Guncon 2 lightgun, and is available with an
      unusual two-player cooperative gameplay mode named "two-gun mode" by allowing two players to play simultaneously
      on a single-player mode without the use of split-screen, or weapon switching system (similar to Time Crisis 3,
      with some changes) allowing the player to switch between a fully automatic machine gun, a standard 8-round handgun
      and a 6-round shotgun, depending on settings.

      Unlike Time Crisis 3 and Time Crisis 4, where only the handgun has unlimited ammunition and other weapons are
      replenished by shooting certain enemies, all weapons now have unlimited ammunition in Crisis Zone, though they all
      must be reloaded. As with the PlayStation 2 version of Time Crisis II and Time Crisis 3, players can access the
      Crisis Mission exercise menu through prolonged gameplay. The US version of the PS2 remake is called Time Crisis:
      Crisis Zone.</story>

      located traces of TimeSplitter activities in various time periods on the Earth, Cortez boards the time machine and
      travels to these periods, hoping to aid various characters in their battles against evil.

      TimeSplitters: Future Perfect is a first-person shooter in which players battle their way through thirteen story
      missions spread across six time periods, either alone or cooperatively. The protagonist's arsenal varies depending
      on the time period he travels to: for example, traveling to 1924 will allow Cortez to wield World War I weapons; a
      Soviet setting in the 1960's contains various local firearms of that time period; stages that take place in the
      future feature corresponding futuristic weaponry, etc. In addition to fast-paced shooting gameplay there are also
      some stealth and vehicle-driving segments.

      Like in the previous installments of the series, various multiplayer modes are included. Players can take on
      computer-controlled opponents on any of the fifteen arcade maps, or make their own ones. Players can also compete
      for awards in dozens of arcade league matches and challenges. It is possible to choose from between 150 characters

    <story>Leonardo, training in the woods, is then given the mission to find a mystic amulet by Master Splinter's
      orders. After he finds the amulet, it is revealed that Splinter was telling the story of how they stopped the four
      Stone Generals, and asks Donatello and Michelangelo to continue it. Once, Raph infiltrated Max Winters' tower (as
      Nightwatcher), and eavesdropped on a conversation with Winters and Karai. Raph was then defeated by one of the
      Stone Generals. Later on, Leo found out that Raph was the Nightwatcher, and a chase ensued, ending up with Leo
      being ambushed and captured by the Foot. Raph, feeling guilty, decides to go after the Foot. He then encounters
      one of the Stone Generals, and defeats her, with the help of Don and Mikey. The turtles then head off to rescue
      Leo, and they achieve this goal, right before the temple self-destructs. The turtles then go to Max Winter's
      tower, and Winters tells his story of being an immortal warrior named Yaotl. Yaotl was planning to activate a
      portal to another world, but it released 13 monsters into the earth. Yaotl became immortal, but it also turned his
      generals to stone. Yaotl then planned to stop his mistakes and his immortality by waiting for the portal to come
      again, and send all the monsters back to whence they came. He also made his generals come to life, but they
      remained in stone form. The Stone Generals wanted to live forever, so they turned on Yaotl. The turtles, however,
      managed to defeat the Generals, the portal opened, and the monsters returned to their dimension. Yaotl then thanks
      the turtles and dies happy and free from guilt. After the story, the turtles all realize the importance of family
      and grow closer as not only a family but also as a team.</story>

    <story>TOCA Race Driver 2 (DTM Race Driver 2 in Germany and V8 Supercars 2 in Australia) is a racing video game
      developed and published by Codemasters for Xbox, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Mobile and PlayStation
      Portable. It is the fifth game in the TOCA series.
      Two PSP conversions were released in 2005 and 2006; the first being TOCA Race Driver 2 in Europe and Japan and the
      second being Race Driver 2006 in the US. The game continued to use a scripted career mode as introduced in the
      previous Race Driver game, but dropped the Ryan McKane character. Story-developing cutscenes were played out from
      a first-person perspective, with other characters never addressing the user by name (similar to the storytelling
      method of later Need for Speed titles). The Mobile phone version was released only in the U.S. a few months later.
      The career mode offered a wider selection of championships than previous games, featuring the likes of Supertruck
      and Rallycross in addition to the traditional touring car formats. However, not for the first time in the series,
      the British Touring Car Championship was not included, yet the franchise continued to license the TOCA name in the
      title. In addition, online play was featured heavily, with support for up to 8 players on Xbox Live.
      The PC version of the game features 31 licensed and fictional global race locations offering 48 tracks. These
      include Hockenheim from the German DTM series and Surfers Paradise from the Australian V8 series. The PS2 version
      features an additional track, Catalunya.
      The PlayStation 2 version also allows up to 8 PS2 on-line players, without broadband Internet service being
      required, too.</story>

    <story>TOCA Race Driver 3 follows on from the ideas started in Race Driver 2. The game attempts to include as many
      different forms of four-wheeled racing in one game, as well as injecting each with a high degree of realism.

      The game has over 70 licensed cars and 80 real tracks, as well as 35 different disciplines of racing.

      There are two main gameplay modes. The World Tour mode has the player starting a racing career and, with the help
      of a Scottish manager, attempting to gain renown and acceptance into more famous racing events. There are 3D
      rendered cutscenes shown from the player's point-of-view, which move the story along and, while not as detailed as
      its predecessor, gives a good idea of the back scenes of a professional racer's life aside from just the racing.
      This mode includes mixtures from all the racing disciplines.

      The second mode allows the player to choose one discipline and play a career focused on that choice. This mode has
      no back-story and longer, more realistic races.

      TOCA Race Driver 3 provides two different driving models, Simulation and Pro-Simulation. The latter is recommended
      for gamers with analog steering wheels only. Simulation is intended for gamers without wheels, or who want an
      easier experience. This mode is also noticeably easier than the Simulation mode from TOCA Race Driver 2.</story>

    <story>Takaaki Kono is a high school student who has troubles understanding girls, and cannot quite imagine starting
      a romantic relationship with one of them. He sees the childish and cheerful Konomi Yuzuhara, his childhood friend,
      as a younger sister. However, relationships between boys and girls rarely remain innocent, and Takaaki begins to
      feel that perhaps he is able to see Konomi differently. It all becomes even more complicated when another female
      childhood friend of Takaaki's returns to town, and when he realizes that there might be other young women in his
      school who might become interested in him.

      To Heart 2 isn't directly connected story-wise to To Heart, though it has similar setting and themes. The game is
      essentially a visual novel, with much of the story evolving automatically, displayed as text descriptions and
      dialogues superimposed on still anime-style images. The player is prompted to make decisions from time to time,
      which will influence the course of the story. The game is divided into school days; at the end of each day, the
      player can choose a location among several ones available for Takaaki to visit. Locations are accompanied by
      portraits of corresponding girls, making it more clear to the player which relationship he'll be promoting by
      making his choice.</story>

    <story>The third entry in the Tokimeki Memorial series follows the same story template as its predecessors: the
      protagonist is a male high-school student, and his goal is to win the affection of one of the several available
      female interests. This time, the school in question is Moegino High, and the suggested "main" love interest is
      called Yukiko Makihara.

      Tokimeki Memorial 3 differs from its predecessors in graphical style: it is the first in the series that utilizes
      character animation and 3D cel-shaded graphics.

      The gameplay in Tokimeki Memorial 3 underwent certain changes compared to the previous games. One of the main
      changes is a simplification of the complex statistics system. The hero has only three main parameters in this
      game: strength, willpower, and stress. Progress with a girl is measured by levels, similarly to role-playing
      games. Otherwise, the game still retains the simulation approach, and includes the traditional schedule-making,
      date-choosing, and participating in various school and leisure activities. The protagonist can also wear different
      clothes, have different hobbies, and even dedicate his time to playing video games.</story>

      market at highly inflated prices.

    <story>Top Spin is the Xbox's first tennis game, and it's playable over Xbox Live, allowing the player to compete in
      the XSN Sports Network. Over Xbox Live, two players can face each other in a one-on-one match, while in a doubles
      game up to four players can join. Stats are recorded and rankings are updated hourly at XSNsports.com.

      The game has a career mode that takes the player all over the world. The first step is to create a player and give
      him a technical mastery. Once in the game, the player may compete in various tournaments. There are games, minor
      pro games, and professional tournaments. Winning games earns money and a higher ranking. The goal is to go from
      rank one hundred to number one.

      Four different statistics can be gradually improved: serve, backhand, forehand, and volley. A higher skill will
      make for better and harder serves, more accurate and powerful back- and forehands, and the ability to keep the
      ball in play longer with volleys. There are also skills to obtain, such as risk and ace, which improves chances of
      hitting a successful risk shot or acing the opponent on a serve.

      In Exhibition mode, the player may choose a created character or one of several real life pros, such as Pete
      Sampras or Anna Kournikova.</story>

    <story>Torino 2006 is the official game of the XX Winter Olympic Games held in Turin, Italy, and the eight in the
      line of multi-event IOC licensed titles. The game includes 15 events scattered on 8 disciplines: Alpine Skiing
      (Downhill, Super G, Giant Slalom and Slalom), Ski Jump (Normal and Large hill), Speed Skating (500m, 1000m and
      1500m), Women's Biathlon, Nordic Combined, Bobsled (Womens' 2 and Mens' 4), Luge and Cross Country. All venues
      were modelled after their real counterparts.

      Gameplay, as expected, requires more reflexes than the button-bashing of their Summer counterparts. Alpine Skiing
      is a matter of skill and quick reflexes, as the player, other than set the direction, only has to choose when to
      crouch to gain speed (mostly in Downhill and Giant Slalom) and when to carve the snow for sharper turns (either to
      correct a bad trajectory or approach a tighter gate). These events are based on a simplified version of the engine
      that power Ski Alpin 2006, also by 49Games. Unlike most other games that feature alpine skiing, the penalty for
      missing gate depends on the difficulty level chosen: on easy, six misses are allowed, three in medium and none on
      hard, each carrying a time penalty that depending on how well the player did can just affect the total score or
      mean losing a medal.

      Ski Jump (also a simplified version of another game, RTL Skispringen 2006) requires the player to keep the balance
      while descending the hill, jumping at the correct time, counter the effect of the wind in the athletes' balance
      for maximum distance and then land in perfect telemark fashion.

      Cross Country and Biathlon are relaxed disciplines where all that counts is keeping the best trajectory possible
      while looking out for straight paths that can be used for short sprints and downhill slopes that can be done while
      crouching, which allows greater speeds and lower fatigue accumulated from sprints and more hasty climbs. Biathlon
      is pretty much the same as Cross Country, except it also includes two shooting sessions, with the steadiness of
      the aim affected by the fatigue levels.

      Skating disciplines require a strong, well timed start, and then accurate button pressing as the skater makes each
      step. Bobsled and Luge are similar with only two differences: The startup in Bobsled is done by following the
      on-screen cues and press up on the right time and other than setting the direction, it's also possible to make
      minimal path changes. The winner is the fastest competitor after two heats (instead of the official four).

      Nordic Combined is a Large hill ski jump which sets the start time for each competitor in the Cross country
      section.

      It's possible to compete in all 15 or just 9 events, or even create your own competition, with up to four
      competitors. At each competition the players aim for both medals and the score table, based on the results on each
      individual event. However, the challenge does not stop with winning medals. The player can unlock additional
      strips by completing challenges, such as hitting all 10 targets in Biathlon, having a perfect Bobsled start,
      winning a gold medal and beat each top record on every event or not missing a single step on Speed Skating. The
      difficulty level affects events differently: in Alpine skiing, it means CPU-controlled players are faster and
      fewer gate misses are allowed, in Ski jump wind can appear from any direction and in Speed skating, in addition to
      set the pace, the player also has to steer the athlete to keep her in the best path.</story>

      from -1 to 2 become 30 in a 0-99 scale, the 3D engine was retouched with new AI and presentation, and finally, if
      the player is tired of world class footballing, now there's the opportunity to create a new club, and bring it up
      from the bottom leagues.</story>

    <story>Total Immersion Racing is a simulation concentrating on the GT / GTS and PRO (prototypes) classes racing
      series. Since these are official racing classes the game simulates circuit racing only.

      Prototypes (PRO) classes, modeled and detailed according to the real models.

      12 circuits are available in total, like Silverstone, Monza, Hockenheim and Talheimring among others.

      Only a few of the circuits and the cars are available on initiation and the rest get unlocked upon the completion
      of several races and challenges later in the game.

      The player can play the game in four different modes: via the career mode, the quick race mode, the time trial
      mode and the challenge mode.

      mode is to win the seasons in order to gain contracts with better car teams and get promoted through the three
      classes.

      The challenges are unified type of races which means that they are either same model cup races, same manufacturing
      country, same class etc. Winning one challenge unlocks the next till all 30 available get won.</story>

    <story>Tour de France is an arcade racing game based on the premier road cycling event in the world.

      The game features 5 different game modes: Arcade. where the player competes freely on any of available tracks,
      Tour de France, where the player aims to win the prestigious competition in five years, by training and winning
      enough money to afford better bike parts and training sessions, Time Trial (racing against the clock) and train
      basic skills.

      As the player is controlling a bike, it isn't just a matter of pressing down the throttle button and avoid other
      competitors while keeping the best possible trajectory. While the last two are still as important, the player must
      pace according to the stamina of the racer. While it can be partially replenished using water bottles, to win
      races the player must use downward slopes to gain velocity while still recovering stamina as well as taking
      advantage of the slipstream of other riders. While losing all stamina won't immediately abort the race, the rider
      will stop and put a feet down until it recovers to an acceptable level, making any chance of a good result
      impossible. The race will stop, however, once the damage (sustained by hitting other riders of fences at high
      speeds) is greater than half of the stamina bar.</story>

    <story>While games of the Pro Cycling Manager series attempt to recreate the feeling of being a Pro/Continental Tour
      cycling team manager, Tour de France: Centenary Edition is all about providing the thrills of being a cyclist,
      starting from the end of the peloton and making way to get a chance at victory. The game is licensed by the Tour
      de France, and features many real teams and cyclists in six stages, some of which available in reverse mode. Due
      to the nature of the name, this changes drastically the nature of the tracks - what can be a perfect track for
      climbers becomes one for the technical riders (with good breaking and turning abilities) in reverse.

      While the game provides a much simplified arcade experience, it plays a lot differently from games featuring motor
      vehicles. The player has a limited stamina bar, which decreases as the player goes faster to break away from the
      current group or pedals harder to beat a steeper hill. In order to replenish it, he can drink a limited number of
      water-bottles, use down slope sections or, the key to a successful stage, use opponents' and team-mates
      slipstreams. However, this is not all without risks - down slope sections can be tricky due to the enormous
      speeds, and colliding takes stamina as well as time (and eventually, might force a retirement), and slipstreams
      are not always available or big enough. As cycling is also a team sport, the player can request a team-mate to
      slipstream him during a break, or to give him additional water bottles. They are also easier to slipstream, as
      they won't break away if the player close too long. Also playing a huge part on the race is the weather - rain
      makes pedalling much harder and increase the breaking distance noticeably, while fog reduces stamina loss, but
      players must be careful not to overdo speed due to limited viewing distance.

      Game modes include training, arcade, time trials and the Tour de France, a career mode where the player can start
      a 5-year plan to become the world's number one cyclist by winning local races, which allows to afford better bike
      parts and training sessions. Parts affect mostly how well the player controls the bike, but as the game simulates
      the stage until the final miles, the starting position in the peloton is defined by the training, so a player who
      has a top bike but neglected training will struggle to perform well in the Tour de France, as instead of starting
      in the top 40 will start in 80th or even worse, losing precious time and both sprint and mountain points in the
      process.</story>

    <story>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the
      defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the
      Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again
      all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.

      The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the
      movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow
      for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side
      include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new
      character), and Megatron.

      Though the game doesnâ€™t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as
      special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly
      through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the
      player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards
      as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.

      For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a "Remote Weapon System",
      which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.</story>

    <story>Tecmo presents TRAPT for the PS2, a puzzle-based game that contains a number of horror elements in its
      interesting storyline. The game is a continuation of the KAGERO: Deception series that began on the Playstation,
      but players aren't required to play the original games to understand TRAPT. The storyline begins when Princess
      Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed
      by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend
      souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess
      the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while
      avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a
      number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal
      balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by
      several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn't quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain
      traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can't be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror
      elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge.

    <story>Marcus Reed is a gangster turned cop who is out to clean the streets of New York. Marcus joins the Organized
      Crime Division of the NYPD with the intent to rid the city of crime and violence. Hoping to make a name for
      himself after his mentor is shot down, Marcus goes after the top crime syndicates of the city.

      Besides having to do this, Marcus is a street-level cop. He is responsible for anything from stopping street
      fights to stopping gang wars to defusing bombs! Not only this, he can frisk people on the street for contraband,
      can do trunk searches on cars, as well as issue tickets to speeders.

      But if Marcus is gonna do all those things, hes gonna do it his way. Need some cash? Marcus isn't opposed to a bit
      of extortion from the local pharmacy. Need some a way to stabilize your career after that rampage last week? Plant
      some evidence on a guy and bring him in. No one will know. Pistols not cutting it for you? The gun stores sell
      police officers anything, from M4's to flamethrowers to RPGs.

      With the city of New York at your fingertips, and nearly every building accessible to you, how will you rule? Will
      you be a shining beacon of morals, or a shady figure in the underworld of NY. The choice is up to you.</story>

    <story>True Crime: Streets of LA is a free-roaming driving and action game similar in concept to Grand Theft Auto
      III. The game's structure is mission-based; most of the missions are dictated by the story and initiate following
      a cutscene that advances it. Failing a mission still allows the player to continue playing through the chapter and
      undertake subsequent missions; in some cases this will lead to branching paths and optional missions. However, in
      order to complete the whole chapter the player must eventually succeed in all the main missions.</story>

      The game plays as a competitive vertically-scrolling shooter, in which two players face off in separated play
      areas and try to shoot and evade the incoming enemies. Blasting said enemies in succession causes a special attack
      to be launched towards the opposing player, which is based on the character you selected and ranges from meager
      fireballs to bosses and targeted attacks depending on your power level and the amount of combos you pull off.

      The game uses completely polygonal graphics, and features a story mode, which centers around the adventures of the
      young witch Time, an arcade mode in which you freely select which character to use, and of course, a 2-player Vs
      mode and support for online multiplayer. Also included is an unlockable version of the original game.</story>

      teleportation device that will locate all five talismans,[2] which will in turn have the power to free his family
      from the Dreamtime,[3] The game takes place in "Rainbow Cliffs", which is in turn divided into a series of
      "zones", each of which act as the hub areas of the game. Each zone contains three portals, each of which lead to a
      level.[4] The goal of each level is to obtain a select amount of thunder eggs, which can be retrieved by either
      performing a certain task, completing a "Time Attack" challenge that can be unlocked upon said level's completion,
      freeing five bilbies,[2] a group of animals who raised Ty after his parents were imprisoned, or by being found
      alongside the level's set path.[2] A level is cleared either by collecting a select amount of thunder eggs and
      reaching the end of the path, or beating certain min-games, each will return Ty to Rainbow Cliffs hub world.[2]
      Retrieving a thunder egg in a level will cause it to appear on the game's pause menu.[5] When at least seventeen
      thunder eggs in a zone are obtained, the player must navigate their way to the talisman machine; after the machine
      manages to locate a talisman, it opens another portal leading to their original locations; inside these portals,
      the player must fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access to a new zone</story>

      There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the
      Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road
      following a traffic accident. And finally, to top it all off, the save/continue points are outhouses.</story>

    <story>The last game in the line of Silicon Dreams' Champions League licensed titles (and only released in European
      markets), Season 2001/2002 includes all 32 teams qualified for the competition plus all finalists since 1960.
      There is exclusive Champions League footage to be unlocked and the in-game commentary is done by Guy Mowbray,
      Barry Venison and Gabby Logan.

      The game allows the player to participate in friendlies, Champions League matches, leagues and cup tournaments.
      You can also edit players and create teams with custom players. Tactics can be modified to suit the team's style
      and qualities. The gameplay remains close to the previous title, with free-flowing ball physics and the stress on
      accurate passing. The new changes mostly revolve around set pieces (it is now possible to aim to a player).

      Graphically, it uses a new engine with features such as volumetric grass and real-time lighting.</story>

    <story>The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the AtatÃ¼rk Olympic Stadium in
      Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most
      important. That honour goes to the "The Season" mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and
      then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions
      League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with
      the Champions League final. This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium
      and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them
      crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other
      modes include the usual friendlies, "home and away" (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can

      Building on similar FIFA Licensed products, EA continues to tune their new Match AI and celebrate such football

      The most unique aspect of this title on Xbox 360 is the Ultimate Team mode which allows the player to manage a
      fantasy team using a deck of virtual cards analogous to other fantasy trading card games played with real cards.
      The deck represents a team of players, managers and other staff which are used to manage and develop a fantasy
      team from humble beginnings to the best team in the in the game. Cards may also be put up for trade with other
      players to help you acquire rare cards and earn game credits. Players can take their Ultimate Teams online and use
      additional game play cards to strategic advantage during the match.</story>

    <story>The Ultimate TV &amp; Film Quiz is a quiz game for three or four players/teams.

      The questions are, obviously, based on films and television and there are four game modes:
      Super Star: In this mode the game is played over three rounds of eight questions. The winner is the player with
      the most points and players each have two 'jokers' to remove a wrong answer
      Play or Pass: This is also played over three eight question rounds. Players have three lives and lose a life with
      each incorrect answer, they also have one joker per round which they can use to pass a tough question on to an
      opponent. If a player answers their question correctly they can select which opponent is asked the next question.
      Shoot Out: A quick on the button round where questions are not addressed in turn to each player
      Quiz Trilogy: This consists of one round from each of the above quiz modes.
      All quiz modes have three eight question rounds and the right answer is not given when a question is answered
      incorrectly. All questions are asked in 'teleprompter' style, i.e. they are 'typed out' on screen to the
      accompaniment of a clacking sound, and they are all multiple choice with four possible answers to choose from. The
      game has no 'high score' table to record how many times a player wins nor does it have any movie/TV clips or
      soundbytes.

      This game is a little unusual in that players share controllers, players one and two share controller one with
      player one using the Cross,Square, Triangle, Circle buttons while player two answers the questions using the D-Pad
      buttons. Players three and four share controller two in a similar way. The game can be configured to set
      individual player handicaps.</story>

      Top of the League
      Play or Pass
      Shootout
      Football Crazy
      For each question the player gets four alternatives to choose from. Top of the League consists of three rounds of
      eight questions and the player with most points at the end of round three wins. With use of jokers the player can
      remove two wrong alternatives. Play or Pass also consists of three rounds of eight questions and players play
      together. Jokers are not available in this mode. In Shootout jokers are used to force the other player to answer.
      Football Crazy is played over three rounds consisting of one round of each of the other game modes. All modes can
      be played by up to four players but only the Top of the League mode can be played by one player.</story>

    <story>The story revolves around the Planet Mischief, where there is a tradition that once someone turns 3-years
      old, he/she must travel to a planet and learn how to perform "Mischief" and cause panic on that planet. Cosmi, a
      three-year old alien, travels to Earth for his mission, in order to impress his father, the Master of Mischief,
      Cosmi Sr., mostly because Earth is considered the greatest challenge. Cosmi crashes with a TV satellite from a
      town called Coco Town. When crash landing, he manages to hide in an alley on Coco Town, where he is saved by
      Earth's Mischief Master, Master Itazura. He takes him to his Dojo to train, and lets Cosmi move on with his
      mission, on 8 different locations: CocoTown, HighStakesHill, Pranksyvania, PharaohIsland, BigBootyBay,
      FrontiersVille, RaccoonCity and finally Cosmopolis. It is revealed that Cosmopolis is a trap for
      "Anti-Alien-Forces" to capture all of the aliens on Earth by disguising themselves as aliens. Itazura uses their
      trap as the final challenge for Cosmi, and challenges him personally there. Cosmi wins and travels back to Planet
      Mischief to celebrate, but crashes into another TV-station and crashlands on Earth again, this time, in the middle
      of CocoTown square. Of course, panic arises and reporters try to get a snapshot of the little alien, but Cosmi
      accidentally pushes someones camera around, causing it to take a photo of the crowd, thus revealing that several
      of them are also aliens.</story>

    <story>"Unlimited SaGa" is a sequel to Square's famous series of non-linear RPGs. Like in the early Romancing Saga
      games, and in Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the
      game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it
      progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the
      game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower.

      "Unlimited SaGa" feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the
      enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at
      the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in
      pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear
      fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can
      be solved by using a character's special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and
      reach the next area of the game.</story>

      Terrorists and gang members have destroyed your city, and your goal is to bring order back to the city while
      destroying any terrorists and gang members you encounter. Since your enemies are armed to the teeth (usually with
      meat cleavers, Molotov cocktails, and sawed-off shotguns), you're equipped with a riot shield that can be used by
      holding the left trigger. It can absorb an infinite amount of projectiles, but you cannot shoot while you are
      using it. You can get the assistance of firefighters to put out fires, and medics to replenish your health.

      Your weapons can be upgraded by earning medals during your missions. You can earn these medals by scoring
      headshots, arresting enemies with your taser (as opposed to killing them), collecting gang masks, etc. You can
      even unlock extra missions and weapons by arresting gang leaders at the end of each level, so that the police can
      interrogate him and find out the gang's next move.</story>

      Players can choose from a variety of game modes including rally racing in V-Rally Mode, time runs in Time Attack
      mode or time limited challenge runs in Challenge Mode, the last two also being available for up two four players
      taking turns in multiplayer mode. But the main goal is to defeat every racer on the rally circuit and become
      champion. The better players are and the further they get the more cars and tracks can be unlocked. In all, there
      are 80 drivers (six being actual rally drivers), 48 tracks (across six countries), and 20 cars for players to beat
      and unlock. There are two titles to earn - the 1.6 liter 2WD championship, and the 2 liter 4WD championship.

      Players can view the race from inside the car or behind it as they scream through snow, rain, fog, dirt, gravel
      and over jumps at different times of day and night as they try to become the best rally racer on the planet.

    <story>Hundreds of years before Lenneth's tale, another saga lies concealed by the gods. The valkyrie Silmeria once
      served Odin loyally, but after an incident ignited a conflict between them, Odin forcefully reincarnated her as a
      human. The human soul that would carry her spirit was that of Alicia, Princess of Dipan. Ordinarily, Silmeria-s
      consciousness would have been sealed, her spirit dormant until she was next summoned... However, the forced
      transmigration causes Silmeria's spirit to awaken within Alicia, leaving two souls to inhabit a single body. The
      spirit that should have been sealed has awakened-a situation Odin will not ignore for long. This installment
      introduces the new Photon Action System to the classic side-scrolling action format found in the original.
      Projecting photons grants players more freedom to explore and expands the action, resulting in challenging puzzles
      with clever solutions. Add to that "sealstones" that affect the laws of nature in dungeons, launching strategy to
      new heights. The unique battle system of the previous game has evolved into the Advanced Tactical Combination
      Battle System.</story>

    <story>Vampire Night is a light gun game produced by Sega's Wow Entertainment, distributed through Namco and
      released in 2000 for video game arcades. It was later ported to PlayStation 2 in November 2001. Two players can
      team up to take down on screen enemies.

      A struggle between light and dark, from 300 years back, is about to ensue. The parties involved are Michel and
      Albert, the two vampire hunters representing light, and the vampires representing dark. The story takes place in
      an alternate version of the year 2006 in France, when progress looks stuck in the late 19th century.

      Michel and Albert rescue a 12-year-old girl named Caroline who witnessed a couple of villagers held hostage by the
      vampire sarcoma. After rescuing the villagers and Caroline, the vampire hunters proceed into the castle to destroy
      the remaining forces of dark.

      Although the forces of evil reveal that they created Michel and Albert to kill themselves, they became afraid of
      death and tried to stop them. It is important to note the Hunters are in fact Dhampyrs (half-vampires),
      foreshadowed by their glowing eyes and sunglasses. The outcome is a pyrrhic victory for the forces of good; as the
      forces of evil are stopped, the Vampire Hunters decide to let the rising sun end their own lives as well.

      The game ends with Caroline paying her respects to the Vampire Hunters at their graves.</story>

      In later levels, blobby enemies known as 'Boonchies' turn up and begin to slowly zero in on Vibri. She must dodge

    <story>Virtua Pro Football is Sega's attempt to compete with the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series. It's more
      similar to those than the more arcade based games in the Virtua Striker series. Controls work as can be expected
      and include short and long passes, crosses, shots and different defence options. The game features a special one
      on one mode where offensive players can challenge and dribble past a defender. The camera then zooms in to a
      behind the shoulder perspective of the dribbler and the player can do different stick and button combinations to
      get past the defender. Some of the movement options that are possible are lunge, feint and nutmeg.

      The game features over 250 teams in twelve leagues (including three licensed ones; Dutch Eredivisie and Gouden
      Gids Divisie and Spanish LFP Primera Division). Competitions that the player can compete in are domestic leagues,
      club cups, international cup and custom leagues and cups. More unique is the player mode where the player gets to
      create and develop his own footballer. For each week the player can choose between practice, rest and going out.
      Practice is done through different mini games and by playing these the different skills will increase but so does
      the risk for injuries. Therefore rest is also needed at times. Going out means interacting with different people
      at various places and is needed to become more known to the supporters and the public. It's also possible to buy
      stuff, both football items and luxury items. Part of the player mode is also various events such as comments from
      the coach, meetings with the press and contract negotiations. The game also features a play book mode where the
      player can create his own tactics for set pieces.

      Teams created in Sega's other football game, Let's Make A Soccer Team! can be imported into Virtua Pro Football.

      It features an all girl cast of cell-shaded manga girls, starting out with 8 teams but more are added as you

      The game contains several modes of playing, such as World Exhibition and Beach Volleyball, and you can play as

      You never have to move the players around the court yourself as they do it themselves, and you just have to time

      Dragon Peace dragon user, you're considered a hero by commoners and are given a swank little home on the island.
      Your home is called House Heaven (as it's the "seventh" house, it's actually supposed to be called "House Seven").
      At the end of every day, you return home to save your progress, eat dinner and sleep. Three characters reside with
      you in House Heaven and provide support for your adventures. Your goal is to take out spirits and make your way to

      Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull
      off the best tricks. Co-operative mode has one player driving the boat while the other hangs on behind, with new
      challenges for the boat driver to complete as well as the rider.</story>

    <story>In War of the Monsters, players take the roles of large monsters in city environments. The game plays as a
      fighting game yet works differently than the traditional one-on-one structured rounds. Instead, fights can include
      up to 4 players in a four-way simultaneous fighting structure. The camera is in third person perspective, allowing
      the player to focus solely on their character.

      Monsters have two status bars in each game, health and stamina. Like the standard fighting game formula, every
      time a monster takes damage, their overall Health bar drops until it is completely depleted, resulting in player
      defeat. Stamina determines how much energy a monster can attack with. The bar drops if a monster picks up another
      foe or performs a ranged attack. If the bar is full, a monster can perform special attacks, whereas if the bar is
      completely drained, they become temporarily immobilized.</story>

    <story>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Party Edition is a quiz game based on the successful TV show and varies it to
      be more suited for multiplayer. The basic rules are still the same: The player takes the role of a candidate and
      has to answer 15 questions by choosing the correct answer out of four given possibilities. For every right answer
      he receives money but he also loses money when choosing poorly (there are two "guarantee points" where he falls
      back to so he doesn't lose all). There are also three jokers: eliminating two false answers, asking the viewers in
      the studio per poll and phoning a friend. In the game the latter is a prerecorded conversation.

      The game has a more comical look as in the former game versions because the player has to choose between different
      characters which are present during the game and give humorous statements. New are also the three difficulty
      levels: while "normal" represents the regular rules described above the "easy" mode add three lives which are
      basically second chances when answering a question wrong and in "hard" mode the player has no access to jokers. In
      the "quick fire" mode the player needs to answer as much questions as possible.

      Multiplayer mode has even less to do with the original rules. Here every player can buzz in after the game states
      the question. The fastest player has to answer within one second or another player can steal it from him. He has
      also the possibility to force another player to answer the question - but of course he gets punished when the
      other player gets it right (who also gets an extra reward). Every player gets three lives. The goal is to answer
      15 questions correctly. There are also four additional multiplayer variations: quick fire, play-or-pass (a player
      can choose to answer a question himself or pass it away), millionaire remix (collecting lives and guarantee
      points) and multimillionaire (team-based).</story>

      Featuring "stroke-shaded" animation-style graphics, a "Wild West" setting, and a completely 3D game engine (not
      just for battles, as in the previous games), Wild Arms 3 is designed to make good use of the power of the
      PlayStation 2.

      Wild Arms 3 features four main characters and takes the time to let players become acquainted with each of them.
      The "drifters" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward
      a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the
      once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act
      in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work.

      As the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve
      and barriers to overcome. The different special abilities of each character must be used to solve different parts
      of the game's complex puzzles. A technique dubbed "expressive communication" is designed to allow players to
      quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures
      stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to
      offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and
      weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair.


      Wild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons &amp; a unique
      battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets
      to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun
      Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles. Wild Arms 3 embodies tried-and-true elements of a
      role-playing classic.</story>

    <story>You play as a young teenager named Jude Maverick. You live in a quiet village that floats high above the
      ground, unaware of the world that lies beneath it. But one day, your world is shattered to pieces, and you descend
      onto the earth to face the terrible reality: the world of Filgaia was devastated by wars. A few settlements amidst
      rusty tanks is all that is left of civilization. The democratically elected government has some plans for
      improving the conditions of the world, but as you meet a young girl whom they used as a tool for their purpose,
      you realize you must find a better plan to save her, and the world, from complete destruction.

      The fourth installment of the Wild Arms series abandons its traditional Wild West theme and is set in a
      post-apocalyptic world. The gameplay system introduces hex-based battles. Battle screens are divided into seven
      hexes, each one of which can hold several party members or foes. You navigate your characters on the battle field,
      trying to force the enemy into an uncomfortable position. There is also a variety of skills you can learn and
      apply in battles to get benefits. As in previous Wild Arms games, the dungeons contain many environmental puzzles
      to solve.</story>

    <story>Wild Water Adrenaline is a game based on whitewater kayaking and rafting. Up to four players, in single
      kayaks or controlling a raft together, can play simultaneously to go down rivers, conquer rapids and drop off
      cliffs. The player especially needs to pay attention to the steering, which is controlled through the analogue
      sticks, one for each of the character's arms, to avoid a variety of obstacles. This is done by constantly moving
      them in a circular motion.

      Next to the main game modes, there is also a training to explore the course and get used to the handling. The game
      is endorsed and has been developed in collaboration with Salomon, a manufacturer of articles for outdoor sports.

    <story>In a world where terror takes many forms, a new weapon threatens to shake the balance of power. Freedom's
      last hope rests in the hands of three new operatives, who must race against time to recover this doomsday device.
      The fate of the world hangs by a thread, and a few ticks of the clock means the difference between justice and
      annihilation. WINBACK 2 brings to the series a new "route" system that lets players experience each mission from
      the perspective of different operatives. There are 30 intense missions, multiple difficulty levels, and new
      weapons including the highly-anticipated sniper rifle. The new Winback assault team is comprised of three young,
      yet combat-proven operatives led by Craig Contrell. Each team member is qualified in six different weapon types
      and highly-adept at CQB (Close Quarter Battle). They are masters of target identification, engagement and shot
      placement. In the hands of the player, all of these techniques will be put to the test. The game's unique shooting
      action is spread across 30 high-risk operations situated in challenging urban environments and conveyances.

    <story>Pro Evolution Soccer 6 enters the display of 2006/2007 with up-to-date exchange of club and national players.
      Some new clubs were brought to their proper names (such as Manchester United instead of Man Red), while others
      have lose it (such as Chelsea which is now once again London FC). However, despite the names, players are correct
      as Chelsea does have Ballack and Schevchenko, Real Madrid now has Van Nistelrooy which was in Manchester United
      and so on.

      Controls are the same, but moves and strategies have changed, as they tend to do from game to game. Fouls are not
      as easygoing as in previous game, but players turning is now too slow unless you know how to do it properly. Moves
      are much more realistic and goal keepers don't catch every ball with an ease, even easy one can sometimes slip by.
      That said, it all makes one step closer to reality, while it loses the reality factor on some other sides. Cameras
      are typical broadcast, tower, and bird-perspective, and cups, league and master league are still included.</story>

      unlock the next one. A new Zone mode requires players to drive as many loops as possible on a track while
      continuously increasing the speed.
      Another new feature in WipEout Fusion are hovercraft upgrades. Depending on their performance, players receive
      credits after races, which can be used to increase speed, thrust, weapon power, shield strength, lateral
      stability, and brake force of a vehicle. Upgraded vehicles can be used in any other game mode, with the exception

    <story>The man on whom all England's football hopes are pinned joins the digital generation with Sven-GÃ¶ran
      Eriksson's World Challenge. Drawing upon his vast knowledge of the beautiful game, Sven features detailed player
      models, intuitive ball control and the chance to bring the cup back to home soil. Select your team from 204
      national teams (each made up of a squad of fantastic fantasy players) and steer them through a choice of four
      footie competitions - World Cup Qualifiers, World Cup, League or Cup.

      The action on the pitch never lets up with smooth motion capture of the essential ball skills and an instinctive
      control method that allows for some blistering goals. Play head-to-head against the computer or if you think
      you'rr up to it, challenge a friend to up to 30 minutes of frenzied football. The last words go to the man
      himself, "Getting to the World Cup with England has been the challenge of my career. Now play YOUR way to the

      Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8 series. Like Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8, the player must obtain "powerups" and
      defeat enemy vehicles, but must capture the enemy flags in order to win. However, all of the vehicles are tanks,
      hence its name. The game itself is short, making it quite unpopular among gamers. It was also one of the very
      first PlayStation 2 titles to be released. It is considered a spiritual successor to the Battletanx series, since
      it has similar gameplay to that as well, and is made by the same company, 3DO. Also a mototank from Battletanx:
      Global Assault can be seen in the opening title sequence, and many of the playable tanks are inspired or directly
      copied from Battletanx. A reversed M-80 (only in the PS1 version of Battletanx: Global Assault) can also be seen

    <story>Pro Evolution Soccer 6 enters the display of 2006/2007 with up-to-date exchange of club and national players.
      Some new clubs were brought to their proper names (such as Manchester United instead of Man Red), while others
      have lose it (such as Chelsea which is now once again London FC). However, despite the names, players are correct
      as Chelsea does have Ballack and Schevchenko, Real Madrid now has Van Nistelrooy which was in Manchester United
      and so on.

      Controls are the same, but moves and strategies have changed, as they tend to do from game to game. Fouls are not
      as easygoing as in previous game, but players turning is now too slow unless you know how to do it properly. Moves
      are much more realistic and goal keepers don't catch every ball with an ease, even easy one can sometimes slip by.
      That said, it all makes one step closer to reality, while it loses the reality factor on some other sides. Cameras
      are typical broadcast, tower, and bird-perspective, and cups, league and master league are still included.</story>

    <story>World Super Police is a single player police pursuit game.

      Gameplay here is virtually identical to games like Outrun, a series of games that started life on the DOS and
      Amiga platforms in the mid eighties.

      The story behind the game is that normal police cars cannot catch criminals in really fast cars so, in order to
      combat increasing car crime, the World Super Police (WSP) have been formed. There are two strands to this game,
      one based around the Blue Wing group (WSP Japan) and the other around Red Hawks (WSP USA). In each strand there is
      a story but the missions are basically the same, the player's car sits firmly in the centre of the screen at the
      bottom and the scenery rushes by. On the left of the screen is a vertical bar which gives a 'radar' view the road
      ahead
      The object is to keep the car on the road, travel as fast as possible avoiding other traffic, and take-out the bad
      guy with whatever weapons the player equipped their car(s) with. This involves racing for a minute or so until the
      target(s) show up on the radar at which point the felonious fiend must be stopped before they reach the border.
      Some missions are solo and unarmed, while in others the player is accompanied by fellow WSP in super cars and they
      can switch between offensive and defensive formations.

      The game's main menu also features a Training option which, unusually, is greyed out at the start of the game and
      can only be accessed once the player has completed one or more missions in either story. The menu also has a Royal
      Scramble option in which the player can replay old missions, naturally this too can only be accessed once the
      player has completed one or more missions</story>

    <story>The updated port of the original Xbox version of Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions adds several new features.
      Missions are now ranked based on how quickly they are completed, and fast times reward medals. By completing a
      bonus objective on hard mode, such as destroying traffic, a bonus mission will be unlocked. Earning a gold medal
      in a bonus mission will further unlock a cheat code, like unlimited time or low gravity. A free mode is available
      now too, allowing the player to drive through the city without worrying about a time limit. Finally two new
      features have been added to the cars: an adrenaline feature that slows down time, and a limited supply of
      short-range missiles.

      A new multiplayer mode allows two players to play on a single screen, with the camera following the trailing
      player. Different modes are available, such as a mode where the trailing car attempts to ram the leading car, or a
      normal racing mode.</story>

    <story>WWE All Stars can be seen as a successor to WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game. Unlike the simulation-based
      WWE SmackDown vs. Raw games, it offers a more arcade-oriented gameplay, featuring elements of fighting games, with
      over-the-top moves and unrealistic animation.

      Similarly to versus fighters, the wrestling in the game is predominantly combo-based. The wrestler's signature
      moves are exaggerated, including nearly supernatural elements such as diving high into the air or slow motion
      moves. The game features popular WWE wrestlers from its time, such as Triple H, The Undertaker, Rey Mysterio, Big
      Show and John Cena, as well as WWF wrestlers from the past: Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, The Ultimate Warrior, Jake the
      Snake and the "Macho Man" Randy Savage.

      The game includes a Path Of Champions mode, where players can choose a WWE Legend or Superstar to either become
      the WWE Champion, the World Heavyweight Champion, or the WWE Tag Team Champions.</story>

    <story>This installment of the Smackdown series continues the Smackdown vs. Raw era, which now uses a yearly date in
      the title, similarly to other sports titles.

      The game includes an updated roster of wrestlers, as well as many classic superstars like Bret Hart or British
      Bulldog. It also includes many new arenas from recent Pay-Per-Views, as well as a classic arena from Wrestlemania
      9. A new recorded dialogue for many of the wrestlers is featured in the storyline, as the player goes through many
      different plots in the Season Mode, chasing the championship belts.

      Gameplay has been slightly enhanced, with a larger list of moves available to each wrestler, and pre-match
      mini-games to start your fight off with and determine who has the upper hand.

      Another addition is the General Manager Mode, where the player takes the role of a GM trying to book a weekly
      show. Taking into account costs to contract wrestlers, keeping a chosen wrestler happy and healthy, and putting on
      matches and setting up feuds to keep the ratings for the show high are the objectives of this mode.

      It is also possible to earn Smackdown Dollars in the game, which the player can use to buy new moves, new
      create-a-wrestler items, Legends wrestlers, and even furniture to customize a locker room. The player can also
      earn trophies for his trophy case by completing challenges and beating the GM Mode.</story>

    <story>The control system of the game is heavily influenced by other popular fighting titles, such as Street
      Fighter, Dead or Alive, or Darkstalkers. The gameplay mechanics are tailored to a very gradual learning curve:
      super attacks are performed by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously, and multi-hit combos can be
      executed by pressing the punch and kick buttons in a particular order (a feature similar to Darkstalkers' chain

      addition to the basic blocking system, players have various counter attacks available to them that can be executed
      by simply pressing the counterattack button and a direction on the controller. The counter-attacks are specific to
      the type of attack the player is countering.

      The fighting stages are fully 3-D rendered stages with their own layouts. As in Dead or Alive it is possible to
      knock an opponent to a different part of the stage, which functions as its own individual stage. In the X-Mansion,
      for example, an opponent can be knocked from the Hangar to the Hallway, then to the outer courtyard where, after
      the 2nd round, the basketball court opens up, allowing a player to be knocked back into the Hangar.

      While in Story Mode, only a limited set of characters are available for each battle; Arcade Mode allows you to
      select from any of the playable characters in a series of eight battles. The Two-Player Versus Mode also allows
      players to choose from any of the unlocked characters. The game also features a Survival Mode, in which a single
      player is pitted against a never-ending flow of computer-controlled opponents in a test of endurance.</story>

    <story>Xenosaga: Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht, the first chapter of a trilogy, is a Japanese-style sci-fi
      role-playing game, sharing many common themes and gameplay elements with Xenogears. The battle system is not
      unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated.
      Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy
      turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling
      slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that
      turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's "boost"
      gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.

      Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with
      lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not
      require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that
      can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and
      accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.

    <story>XGIII: Extreme G Racing is a futuristic racing game. Six teams are competing to win a racing championship,
      the player taking control of any of the two riders available in each team. The game retains the action elements of
      the previous titles: as before, opponents will try to sabotage the race, and the player-controlled character is
      able to answer them with his own arsenal of weapons.

      Unlike the previous installments, weapons cannot be picked up on the road: the player has to purchase them with
      the money earned after a successful race. All weapons now deplete the player's weapon bar with each shot. Another
      change is the absence of the "nitro" boosts utilized in the previous entries; they have been replaced with a turbo
      system, where using the boost drains energy from the player character's shields.</story>

    <story>XII Stag is a vertical scrolling arcade shooter. The player controls a futuristic aircraft and tries to reach
      the end of each stage, where a boss fight waits.

      There are several different types of attacks: a regular shot, which can be upgraded five times by power-ups
      dropped by enemy ships; a side attack is a risky manoeuvre that involves pushing the control stick quickly left
      and right to destroy enemies to the left or right of the player's ship. This will also increase the score
      multiplier. The ship's exhaust can also be put to use by damaging enemies that come up from behind. The final
      weapon is the barrier, which creates a protective ring around the player, destroying all enemies that touch it.

      The game also features a difficulty setting adjusted dynamically by the score - the higher the player scores, the
      more difficult the game gets. XII Stag also has checkpoints in each level, which compare the current player's
      score to the high score at this point in the game.</story>

    <story>One year has passed since Kazuma Kiryu, "yakuza with the heart of gold", defeated his biggest adversary in
      the previous game. Despite this victory, Kazuma has lost more than he had ever imagined.

      But events from the past continue to haunt him. A man he had admired so much, who was like a father to him, has
      revealed a terrible secret before he died. It's time for Kazuma to solve the mystery once and for all. Caught in
      the eternal fight between Kantou and Kansai, the Eastern and the Western organized crime groups of Japan, he soon
      realizes that there are other powers on the stage, including a mysterious Korean organization that seems to be
      connected somehow to his past.

      The sequel to Yakuza continues the story from the previous game, featuring many recurrent characters. The main
      gameplay idea also remains the same - on-foot exploration of urban environments, hand-to-hand fighting, and
      role-playing elements, somewhat similar to the kind of gameplay that was introduced in Shenmue games. The sequel
      features some technical improvements, such as the ability to rotate the camera during the fights. It also contains
      more side missions and mini-games, ranging from playing pool and mahjong to running a club and dating women.

      to deliver their lines and how to modulate their vocal intonations in a manner similar to karaoke games. The

      role-playing game for the Super Famicom developed by Nihon Falcom Corporation. It is the fifth game in the Ys
      series of video games.
      Ys V was originally released in 1995. In 1996, Falcom released a second version of the game for the Super Famicom
      with a higher difficulty level, known as Ys V Expert.
      A PlayStation 2 remake of Ys V was released in 2006 by Taito Corporation, titled Ys V: Lost Kefin, Kingdom of
      Sand.

      Adol is travelling through new lands, in search of more adventure, when he hears of the vanished desert city of
      Kefin. He sets off to investigate this ancient city's disappearance.

      The RPG-style statistical elements and the overhead view of most of the previous games are retained in Ys V. As in
      Ys III, there is no auto-attack; the player must press a button to swing Adol's sword. Adol is also given the
      ability to jump and defend with his shield.
      A new magic system is introduced in Ys V as well, which requires the player to charge up spells by holding a
      button before they can be cast.</story>

    <story>This 3D board game consists of a series of duels, which are played with cards. The game has been split up in
      a Campaign Mode, in which you take on all levels of the Monster Coliseum on your own, a Free Battle Mode where you
      play skirmish matches against enemies defeated in the campaign, and a versus mode to take on a human opponent.
      Before starting, you have to choose a symbol, assign parameters to it (based on monster points, action points and
      power points) and buy a starter kit card deck.

      In a typical campaign game, you start in the entrance hall, where you manage your cards and monsters. To duel, you
      choose one of the four areas with five levels each, and defeat the opponents. New monsters are acquired by winning
      the match. The turn-based duels are played as a card game. Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number
      of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning
      monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages.
      Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various
      parameters, including the land form you are playing on.</story>

      You play in turn as either one of the brothers or the robot. Walter can melee combat with a wrench and shoot
      projectiles while Danny has a slingshot, and the robot can shoot lasers or a charged shot, and can charge an enemy
      and jump high. As they progress through the different levels cut-scenes advance the story. They can grab power-ups

    <story>Keith Miyamoto is a reporter who works for an important newspaper in Los Angeles. In 2005, he travels to an
      island called Capital City, where he has to get a new job. However, on his way from the airport to the city, a
      terrible earthquake occurs. The train collapses and Keith finds himself abandoned by the rescue team. Now he has
      to escape the island, try to save the people stranded on it, and discover the true reasons behind the chaos in the
      city. But that will be anything but easy. The earthquake continues, and any time Keith steps on a half-collapsed
      bridge, crawls over a pile of rumble, or climbs a narrow path between ruined houses, the Earth can start
      trembling...

      Disaster Report is a combination of pure adventure and survival horror genres. Controls, inventory management,
      fixed camera angles and relative vulnerability of the protagonist are reminiscent of Alone in the Dark and similar
      games, while the complete lack of enemies to fight reminds of a classic adventure. There are many ways to preserve
      Keith from constant dying. You can find items and combine them into new ones (for example, finding a helmet and a
      lamp will allow you to build a helmet with a flashlight attached to it). Keith will also need to quench his
      thirst, so you'll have to find water for him. The water taps found in the game also serve as save points.</story>

      series. The release was Japan-only, meaning that it can't be obtained outside of Japan without importing or by
      being downloaded as a ROM. In the story, a young pilot called Kein searches for his older sister Sheryl, who
      disappeared a year ago in a mysterious incident involving a Death Saurer. Zoids in this game were also
      customizable allowing the player to upgrade parts by earning points in other areas of the game</story>

    <story>The fourth game in the Onechanbara, Zombie Hunters 2 is an upgraded version of The Oneechanbara 2 much like
      Zombie Hunters was an upgraded version of Zombie Zone. Zombie Hunters 2 continues the series's hack and slash
      style of gameplay in the vein of Capcom's Devil May Cry or Koei's Dynasty Warriors games. This time, Aya is joined
      by her sister, Saki, and the mysterious Reiko as they must find the cause of a second Zombie outbreak. Retaining
      the "Cool Combo" system and the Rage and Blood meters found in the first game, The Oneechanbara 2 added some
      character specific moves, such as Aya's throwing knives, as well as smarter enemies, and new way's to defeat
      enemies. It also introduced a tag system to the series, allowing the player to select two characters and switch
      between them at anytime.

      Alongside the story mode, the game also featured the arena style survival mode and the quest system. All these
      features were improved slightly, with all the story levels being different, the survival arena's being unique, and
      the quest being much more varied.

      Zombie Hunters 2 saw Riho and Makoto return to the Onechanbara games, as well Hana and Kiku from the D3 game
      Dragon Sisters, also known as Simple 2000 Series Vol. 87: The Senko (Nadesico) . Hana and Kiku could be unlocked
      via quests or having save data from Dragon Sisters, with Riho being available from the start and Makoto unlocking
      after Riho cleared the first stage. All these characters played differently too, instead of just acting as
      alternate costumes like in Zombie Hunters. They also had their own stories, making Zombie Hunters 2 a much fuller
      game than any of its predecessors.</story>
