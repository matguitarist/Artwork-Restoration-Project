    <story>428: FÅ«sa Sareta Shibuya de is a visual novel and adventure video game created by KÅ ichi Nakamura and Jiro
      Ishii, developed by Nakamura's company Chunsoft, and published by Sega, originally in Japan for the Wii on
      December 4, 2008. The game was also ported by Spike to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable.[1] A version
      for iOS and Android was released as well in 2011.[4]

      428: FÅ«sa Sareta Shibuya de is a visual novel set in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo where the narrative is presented
      using a combination of scrolling text, live action stills and video sequences. The game shares many story and
      gameplay elements with Chunsoft's 1998 sound novel game Machi, the most prominent being the locale, Shibuya.
      Although Chunsoft does not openly state 428 is a sequel, the game contains numerous references to Machi, and an
      early marketing slogan reads "Breaking a long silence, Shibuya gets going again."

      The game has received high praise from critics, earning a perfect score in Famitsu Weekly, Japan's largest
      circulating video game magazine. The game also features a special scenario contributed by Kinoko Nasu and Takashi
      Takeuchi of Type-Moon fame, who wrote and provided character designs for them respectively. It was subsequently
      announced by Sega that this particular scenario by Type-Moon would be adapted into an anime TV series titled
      Canaan, which began airing in Japan on July 4, 2009.[5] A series of four novels based on the game were published
      by Kodansha between the months of September and December 2009.[6]</story>

    <story>Ace Combat is the perfect game to have while on the move. Think about it ? when you're a kid, you run around
      holding your arms out pretending to be a fighter plane, right? Or was that just us? Either way, having an airborne
      action game of this pedigree on the PSP is never unwelcome, and Joint Assault marks the first time the series has
      hit the handheld since Ace Combat X in 2006.

      So what's changed? Well, certainly not the midair firefights and frenzied atmosphere ? although the visuals have
      been overhauled and the combat system completely redesigned to provide a closer, more visceral flight experience.
      While some plane games focus on simulation, Ace Combat focuses on accessibility and fun, without losing
      authenticity.

      You get to jet over plenty of real-world locations including Tokyo, London, San Francisco and more, as you take on
      missions to smash enemy fighter pilots out of the sky. Tactical dogfighting is the name of the game here, and the
      'Enhanced Combat View' takes advantage of the huge aerial environments to provide an exhilarating atmosphere as
      you deliver that ace shot at high speed.

      When you're done with the single-player missions, get online for some multiplayer gameplay, which allows for up to
      eight players in an online versus scenario, or four pals in a co-op campaign.</story>

    <story>Alien Syndrome is a top down shooter inspired by Sega's original Alien Syndrome action game. The games story
      takes place thousands of years in the future; by this point in time mankind has explored many parts of the galaxy
      and established numerous colonies. One such colony, Seti-Alpha 5 (SAT5), has ceased communications for some reason
      and it is your job to head to SAT5 and investigate what went wrong. Upon arrival, you encounter the alien
      syndrome, a force which can mutate man and machine into deadly aliens. These events take place roughly 100 years
      after those in the original Alien Syndrome game.

      When you begin the game you can select one of several characters as well as choose a character specialty (such as
      demolitions expert, firebug, seal, tank, and sharpshooter). The specialty you select will determine your initial
      character stats; as you play through the game you earn levels which provide you points to allocate towards
      improving your stats. The character stats help determine your characters accuracy in ranged or close attacks,
      speed, healing power, resistance to fire/radiation, armor strength, and so on.

      Similar to the original game, the action is viewed top down. You'll need to explore the numerous corridors and
      rooms found on SAT5 and eliminate the numerous alien invaders found there. Mission objectives are often provided
      to you which need to be completed. Additional weapons, ammo, and other useful items can be found throughout the
      levels. Your character has a limited amount of energy, and if all energy is lost then you will need to begin again
      at the last checkpoint crossed.</story>

    <story>Ape Escape Academy sees you taking on the role of one of the cheeky monkeys from the Ape Escape series.
      Choose your chimp, then prepare to tackle various classes in Academy Mode. Each 'class' is actually a mini-game.
      Your goal is to complete as many mini-games as possible from the 9x9 grid, and score as many lines as you can
      (sort of like Noughts and Crosses). Mini-games range from mind-bending quizzes to wacky sports games, to the just

      into two, roll each blob over two different colored switches, and then combine the two blobs to form a third,
      different color.

      Each level has different elements to it, some of which will help you and some of which will hinder you. There are
      conveyor belts, moving platforms, launch pads, and jagged corners that when hit, will cause your blob to split
      into two, even three.

      There are 83 different mazes, each one progressively harder than the last.</story>

      also three sponsors which offer free upgrades and/or credits for fulfilling their demands regarding performance
      and stunt rating, but they should be hired with caution because a big penalty is assigned for missed goals. The
      available types of races are Supercross, Rallycross, National, Freestyle, Circuit, Endurcross, Rally and
      Snowcross.

      Besides a basic course editor and multiplayer for up to four players (which is also the maximum number of racers

    <story>Black Rock Shooter: The Game is an action RPG in which players take on the role of the eponymous Black Rock
      Shooter (BRS for short). The game is divided up into several missions in which the player must clear objectives to
      progress.

      On the main overworld, BRS can explore the available areas and look for certain items. Battle begins when the
      player comes into contact with an enemy on the overworld.

      During battle, BRS can aim and shoot with her rock cannon at enemies, block against attacks and sidestep to avoid
      them completely. If the player fires the rock cannon or uses the sidestep too much in a short time, the system
      will overheat, leaving the player vulnerable to attack until it cools down.

      Throughout the game, players can earn abilities that can be equipped to BRS and used in battle, each with their
      own cooldown periods. These include offensive attacks such as a powerful blast, a sniper rifle, or support
      abilities that can increase BRS' stats such as her attack or defense. Certain sections will also see BRS ride a
      motorcycle, in which she can attack enemies on either side of her or use weapons to fire in front of enemies

      to Ulquiorra Schiffer's introduction at the beginning of The Arrancar arc. Unique to Heat the Soul 3 are "Soul
      Road" and "Karakura Heroes." In Soul Road, the player is to select the desired character and partner character.
      Afterwards, the player is set on a board game-like map where the goal is to pass through markers in order to fight
      enemies. After each match, the player is given an amount of "Trust points" (how many received depends on the
      mode's difficulty) which go towards leveling up partner characters and unlocking bonuses, such as alternate
      costumes and new partners. To unlock these bonuses, the player must find a blue marker to turn in their points;
      however, before doing so, the player must answer a multiple choice question. In Karakura Heroes, the player is put
      into a humorous side-story, with some extra anime scenes added. Don Kanonji leads a group of shinigami, initially
      Byakuya Kuchiki and Toshiro Hitsugaya, on some sort of wacky adventure which involves battling several other
      characters. At the mode's completion, a scene shows the gang relaxing at an expensive hotel, doing activities that
      in some way fit their personalities and/or abilities (for example, Hitsugaya snowboarding).</story>

      Ichigo. New features include a "Tag Action" system and a new way for releasing zanpakuto. Transformations such as
      Bankai are now made when 2 bars of reiatsu is obtained and then pressing the L button, rather than selecting a
      character's Bankai form before a fight. There also seems to be 3 styles of tag action: offensive, defensive and
      technical. There is also a game mode called Tag Master, which lets you choose 2 characters to fight with in a
      series of fights. The system also includes specials which use the tagged partner's abilities.

      The game features 32 characters usable in Tag Battle mode, while extra characters can be obtained with Bleach:
      Heat The Soul 4 game save through game conversion. However, these characters are only usable in single mode with
      no in-game transformation. They are selected through a separate menu accessible by pressing L/R in the normal

    <story>Bliss island is an action-puzzler where you play a character called Hoshi (a Zwooph), who using blasts of air
      from his trunk, can juggle or manipulate other objects or himself. The game consists of a collection of mini
      games, which can either be played individually (with the aim being to get a highscore) or through the adventure
      mode (where you play each one in order, only progressing to the next one once you've achieved a goal/high enough
      score).

      The mini games consist of tasks such as

      1. Smashing invader-style blocks as they march down the screen, by moving Hoshi into them. This is done by
      blasting pulses of air from Hoshi, which then make him move.

      2. Blowing fruit balls into other objects (such as flower bumpers) so that they ricochet around the screen and
      into a monsters mouth, similar to Pachinko machines in arcades.

      3. A trickshot billiards game, where you fire Hoshi into the balls on the table, trying to pot them all within a
      certain number of air pulses

      4. Bee Racing, where using similar controls to Hoshi, you race against AI Bees around a track (whilst avoiding
      obstacles such as rocks and snails)

      5. ... and various other mini games that follow the theme of ricocheting balls off targets / into holes either
      within a time limit or to achieve a goal (such as to clear bugs off a flower, to hit another ball off the same
      colour, to pick up stars, etc.)

      The PC version is single player only, but the PSP version also has a 2 player wireless mode (local adhoc), which
      has multiplayer versions of Bee Racing, Invaders and a multiplayer only Soccer game.</story>

    <story>Burnout Dominator is an installment of the Burnout series for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable
      systems. The game is mainly focused on returned Burnouts feature - draining a complete boost meter without
      stopping wich was last seen in Burnout 2: Point of Impact. With return of Burnouts feature there were four new
      game modes added including Maniac Mode (players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts,
      air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in
      this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score
      multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses),
      Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score).
      However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn't feature Crash Mode,
      there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. But PSP version features Burnout HQ where you can
      upload you score and download new track.
      The game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations. Each track has a forward and a
      reverse configuration.</story>

      games: Burnout, Burnout 2: Point of Impact, and Burnout 3: Takedown. Aggressive racing is still the centerpiece
      attraction of Burnout Legends and the player's task is not only to win the races but also crash opponent cars as
      much as possible. Opponent takedowns, drifts, and other stunts award Burnout Points which in turn unlock new cars
      and other awards.

      One player games can be played as single events or as a World Tour where the player needs to compete in different
      races and succeed in them in order to advance through five car classes (Compact, Muscle, Coupe, Sport, and Super).
      In addition there is the Crash mode, where the goal is to create as much wreckage as possible by ploughing the
      player car into the traffic. The different race types include Race, Time Attack, Road Rage, Pursuit, Face Off,
      Eliminator, Burning Lap, and Grand Prix. Multiplayer game modes include Race, Road Rage, Pursuit, special Crash
      modes Double Impact and Party Crash (all these can can be played as single events or as a tournament), and
      Collector Challenge where the player has the opportunity to win other player's Collector cars.

      PSP version game sharing feature allows others to play multiplayer events or single player demo without their own
      Burnout Legends UMD.

      DS version Multi-Pak support allows two player games without additional game cards. More than two player games

      you won't have time to take in the beautiful surroundings in the game.

      The landscape is populated with all kinds of animals, most harmless and will run when they catch wind of you, but
      you have to watch out for predators who will attack, especially Hyenas, wild dogs and even leopards and cheetahs.
      Elephants and rhinos will attack to if they feel provoked.

      After completing a safari you can play it again in the Open Safari in the main menu if you want to go back to a
      favorite hunt, plus after you take down the Trophy Hunt animals you can go after them again on the main menu with
      the option called The Big Five and even hold tournaments to see who is the better hunter. A sure-fire winner for

    <story>Class of Heroes is an enhanced remake of Wizardry Xth: Unlimited Students.

      With the surprising apparition of the labyrinths, the whole world was changed. Many adventurers delved into these
      mazes, hunting for riches, and it wasn't long till the children started following their dreams of becoming heroes.
      To aid these children, the Adventurer Academies were founded, to prepare them in their perilous journeys.

      Players start out at the Particus Academy, the newest of the academies, where they'll be able to assemble their
      party from students, each hailing from one of the 10 available races, 15 professions and 3 alignments. Each race
      has a different attitude toward the others, keeping the party compatibility system already featured in the
      previous games. The academy serves as a home base, where students can modify their team, purchase/sell equipment,
      practice alchemy, heal/revive injured party-members and take on new quests.

      The labyrinths have an overall similar layout, but a few sections are randomly generated upon entrance, so are the
      enemy and item locations. Battles are turn-based, with a tension gauge slowly filling, allowing the party to
      unleash Gambits upon their foes. If the whole party is defeated in one of the labyrinths, as a last resort, a
      rescue team can be sent after them. The longer the rescue team takes to find them, the higher the chance that
      certain items will be lost, or even party members could die permanently.</story>

    <story>Cover Girl is aimed at a female audience and it is described as a 'way to become a Truly Fabulous Female'.
      The game starts by asking some personals details. You enter your name, date of birth, and your favourite music
      style. You then choose one of the three available female characters that will guide you through the game. The
      player then gets to access the Cover Girl magazine where the content is customized based on a number of questions.
      The game for instance asks you whether numbers or letters attempt you more, if you are in the mood for food
      choices or to release your inner child, and if you are more interested in being dressed to kill than deadweight
      dumping. The game then generates a Cover Girl magazine based on your preferences.

      As a digital magazine the player can then read articles about the behaviour of men, horoscopes, recipes, do a
      tarot session, answer questions in a sex-o-meter quiz, consult the Manlation to get to know the behaviour of men,
      complete a Purse-onality quiz to find the perfect purse or do Sudoku puzzles. After going through a number of
      items a new issue becomes available with new content based on the same themes. It also includes a size translator
      to compare and convert the different clothes and shoes sizes around the world. There are 25 mini-games in total
      and over 100 quizzes. Additional magazines were unlocked afterwards and made available through the PlayStation

      "acquaintances" will end up getting caught up in much larger events that revolve around an ancient artifact called
      the Wicked Stone.

      Crimson Gem Saga is a turn-based RPG, with over world travel being done on an isometric plane. The game has some
      minor action elements sprinkled into the turn-based gameplay, like critical combo chains and an ambush system.
      Characters level up individually, but all draw from a group pool of skill points in order to unlock and gain new
      skill abilities, some of which are combination attacks. In essence, the core gameplay is very similar to a JRPG,
      despite the fact that the game's developed by a Korean company.</story>

    <story>Danny is troubled with insomnia. Desperate for sleep and unable to get it, he finds himself a test subject in
      the mad Dr. Reubens' crowning achievement, C.R.U.S.H. (or Cognitive Regression Utilizing pSychiatric Heuristics,
      if you prefer). C.R.U.S.H. puts the subject under hypnosis and allows them to explore their psyche and confront
      their own deep, dark secrets.

      Crush is a platforming game with puzzle elements. Initially, it looks like a third person platformer, but you'll
      soon discover the game's hook - as Danny, you can "crush" the landscape based on the camera direction, giving you
      a new perspective on a previously impassable situation. Huge gaps become mere footsteps wide, or may even
      disappear. Tall buildings can be squashed flat, allowing you to walk over previously impossible terrain. By
      rotating the camera with the D-Pad, you can choose to crush the level sideways, similar to a 2D platformer like
      Super Mario Bros., or top-down, somewhat like Bomberman.

      However, there are, of course, restrictions. Not all blocks can be crossed when crushed. In addition to this, some
      blocks that you can stand on in 3D simply don't exist in 2D. And then there's creatures lurking based on Danny's
      fears: giant cockroaches roam around some levels, and need to be squashed before Danny can get past them. Some
      blocks contain nightmarish limbs that swipe at Danny when he gets too close. And some blocks (representing Danny's
      childhood fear of building blocks) even come to life and patrol the 3D levels.</story>

      some anime will only have their stories partially completed in this game. Despite this, the developer claims that
      Z2 will feature more missions than any other handheld SRW.

      Z2 introduces many popular series from the latter half of the previous decade, including Tengen Toppa Gurren
      Lagann, Gundam 00, and Code Geass. However, this game also marks the debut of Armored Trooper Votoms, one of the

      Every series from Hakai-hen returns, with their sequels/second seasons debuting if applicable. Macross 7 makes its
      Z-series debut, with Dynamite 7 appearing for the first time in any SRW. The only completely new series, Tetsujin

    <story>Darius Burst for PSP is the first new entry in the Darius-series since G-Darius (released in 2002). The plot
      is set in Darius year 1904. Belser has attacked Darius, which had been revived by immigrants from planet Vadis.
      The game is now in 3D although it's still a left-to-right scroll-shooter .

      Darius Burst features a few elements new to the series: first of all, you don’t loose any weapon upgrades when you
      die. Second, there’s a 3-mode burst laser which is basically a revised version of the giant laser weapon featured
      in G-Darius. This time you don’t need to capture and sacrifice enemy units to use it and you may even absorb
      certain types of bullets with it.

      There are 3 silverhawks: “Legend” (the Darius Gaiden ship) piloted by two terminals referred as TI2 and two
      unlockables: “Next” (a next generation model) piloted by Riga Practica and “Origin” ship which is the original
      silverhawk, pilot unknown. Darius Burst is shorter than previous games in the series: there are 11 levels and 8
      bosses total. The game features a number of unlockable trials ("Mission mode") and a “Burst mode” which challenges
      the player to complete the game with a single life.

      The soundtrack is composed by Zuntata, Taito’s in-house music band.</story>

      variations called Metal Bugs to permeate the city. Later upgrades include a flame thrower attachment as well as a
      detonator weapon.

      Daxter's path towards freeing Jak involves a series of platforming and combat challenges through a wide variety of
      environments ranging from a high speed transit system to a fish cannery, and all the way to the Krimson Guard
      fortress where Daxter has to sneak past the guards to eventually save Jak.

      level sequences that take Daxter into a realm where he is the hero. The dream minigames spoof cinematic moments

    <story>Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The
      player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do
      combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal
      damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the
      player's units are destroyed.
      Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or
      force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the
      base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy
      in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters
      inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</story>

    <story>Downstream Panic! is a colourful puzzle game that can mixes elements from Locoroco with Worms.

      A massive cyclone has sucked all of the fish out of the oceans! The player must safely guide them back. Levels
      start at the top of the area where the fish are contained in a blob of water. They need to reach the ocean safely
      at the bottom of the screen with guidance of the player.

      Using a variety of creative tools like fans, onions, rockets, and cloud factories, the fish can be guided through
      platforms, past hungry sharks, piranhas and many other dangers. The tools can also be used to control the flow of
      the water and the direction the fish travel. Plants will stop the flow and by blowing flowers bridges are opened.
      At the start of the level, the area usually needs to be scanned first using the free camera perspective to
      discover all the hazards. Certain fish can be sacrificed, but a sufficient number of them needs to reach the
      ocean.

      The regular mode eventually unlocks the Free Play and Survival modes. In Free Play the player can spend the money
      from regular games to buy tools for the stages. In survival all levels are replayed in succession, but lost fish
      are not regained in the next level.</story>

    <story>echochrome is a puzzle game with a design inspired by the works of M.C. Escher. The gameplay is based around
      optical illusions, as the player must utilize five simple laws of perspective in order to join walkways, hide
      dangers and create path in order to reach the "echoes", checkpoints in the game. This implies that different
      actions are possible based on the camera perspective, which is changed when the player rotates the camera.

      For the PSP there are two different versions. The UMD game offers 105 levels with three game modes for each: Solo
      mode (walk alone), Pair mode (control a white and black mannequin - when they meet each other they merge into a
      grey one and the puzzle is solved) and Others (solo mode with the additional of black enemies). The PlayStation
      store version is called echochrome Micro and only offers 56 levels with the three game modes.

      All versions have a built-in editor. On the PS3 levels can be easily exchanged through the PlayStation Network.
      The system will also automatically download ten custom puzzles, rated highly by other users, to a maximum of 300.
      When the maximum amount has been reached, older ones are replaced.</story>

    <story>echoshift is a spin-off of echochrome, but while the original had the player distorting space to create
      pathways through optical illusions, this is replaced by the time bounce mechanic, which are small sections of time
      repeating themselves over and over again.

      This time around levels take place in a 2D side-scrolling environment, as opposed to the original's 3D spaces, and
      each level has a timer imposed on it, its length varying around 30 to 50 seconds. The objective is still reaching
      the end of the level, overcoming with the help of the time bounces: each time the timer runs out, the player is
      placed back at the start of the level, but shadows will also appear, which carry out actions performed by the

    <story>Every Extend Extra is a remake of the popular freeware game Every Extend and in all main aspects of gameplay
      it sticks to its independent roots. The main difference between E3 and the original game is E3's music adaptation,
      just like the other Tetsuya Mizuguchi's synesthesia titles (Lumines and Rez). E3's main arcade mode allows the
      player to advance through different stages, each of them featuring different background, enemy designs, music,
      bosses and a varying pace of play.

      As in the original game you too are unable to shoot. The only way of defense is to detonate your "ship" in the
      vicinity of the enemy. Enemies appear in randomized patterns, and the main goal is to detonate at the right moment

      cute creature appear on screen. The player can play a variety of games with the pet, such as bowling, fishing or
      jumping on trampolines. The game encourages playing in different environments; by doing so the player has a chance
      of finding "treasures" - customization items. In a separate in-game area called Pet home the player may take care
      of the pet - feed it, wash it etc. and also change its appearance to their liking.</story>

    <story>FIA licensed Formula 1 racing game including the 2005 season teams, drivers, cars, and circuits. The player
      controls the car on the track and tries to either complete a lap in fastest possible time, or race against either
      computer controlled drivers (or in multiplayer mode, against other players) and finish in top position.

      Game can be played in Quick Grand Prix, Event, World Championship, and Multiplayer modes. Quick Grand Prix selects
      a random car and circuit to race. Event modes are Time Attack (race against ghost car), Single Grand Prix, and
      Scenario Mode in which the player needs to complete different kinds of racing tasks such as completing a lap with
      failed brakes and pitting in to fix them. Each successfully completed scenario unlocks the next one. Additional
      scenarios are available for download to PSP.

      World Championship mode lets the player to choose the team to race in and the championship season difficulty. All
      19 circuits of the 2005 F1 season are raced in order and points for finishing in positions 1-8 are awarded. Driver
      with most points at the end of the season wins the championship. Before each race the player can drive practice
      laps to get familiar with the track and the car setup. Player can also drive a single lap qualifying run which
      will determine the grid position at the race start.

      The difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) define the total number of laps, weather conditions, pit stops, and
      tyre wear. Initially only the easy level is selectable and must be completed successfully in top three in order to
      unlock the medium level. In same manner, the medium level must be completed in top three to unlock the hard level.
      Also the Single Grand Prix Event is unlocked by successfully completing the easy level.

      In Multiplayer mode, up to 8 players can play in three different race types. As in singleplayer Time Attack, each
      car races against top time ghost car. Both Head to Head and Single Grand Prix modes allow players to race a single
      grand prix, the difference being that in the latter mode, computer controlled AI drivers are entered to fill the
      grid if less than eight players enter.

      F1 Grand Prix also includes a TV Mode Race where AI cars race each other and the player has no control, except
      selecting the camera view.

      All 2005 season cars are initially available but the game has unlockable F1 cars from past years, such as
      Lotus-Climax 25, turbo powered Williams FW11, and Cosworth classics Lotus-Ford 79 and Williams FW08. Overall game
      style is more arcade than simulation, eg. collisions do not cause any noticeable damage, after a spin-out the car
      is automatically pointed to the right direction, and driving off-track slows the car down. A simple car setup
      system has three presets: Defensive, Balanced, and Aggressive. Player can also enable Brake Assist which
      automatically applies brakes in corners if the speed is too high.</story>

    <story>The game is a street football game in which the player can take control of 4-a-side versions of national
      football teams in matches where the object is to win by scoring a set amount of goals or points via tricks, or
      within a time limit. In the career mode "Rule the Streets", one creates a player and competes in tournaments
      around the world to obtain "Skill Bills" to buy clothing and upgrade his rating. As the player improves, he can
      captain his own street football team and eventually become an international. The best players have special moves
      often named after their nickname.

      Legends of football such as Abedi Pele, Eric Cantona and Paul Gascoigne are unlockable during the game.

      The game has its own in-game radio station, presented by Zane Lowe of BBC Radio 1 and featuring music by artists
      such as Roots Manuva, Sway, Pendulum, The Editors and The Subways.</story>

    <story>Back in 1987, Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy was supposed to be the last game in the Fantasy role-playing
      game series. However, destiny had other plans for Hironobu Sakaguchi and his creation. After twenty years and more
      than a dozen of canonical games the Final Fantasy franchise is still going strong and reaping the rewards of the
      original IP.

      The original Final Fantasy game has already been re-released many times. The PSP version has been built upon the
      Game Boy Advance version of the game. It has bonus dungeons from the Gameboy/Wonderswan versions of the game but
      also features new improved graphics, all in 16:9 with easy to read big texts and better quality of music and
      general sounds. The CG intro from the PlayStation/Wonderswan version has also been redone in 16:9.

      There is an entirely new dungeon dubbed "The Labyrinth of Time" which enforces a time limit within which you can
      explore its dark depths, and also another bonus: an unlockable Yoshitaka Amano Art Gallery which contains
      beautiful artwork from the artist who has provided the illustrations for many games in the series, and like in the
      GBA version there is also bestiary and a unlockable BGM music player. Other features do not change the GBA version
      much, even the the difficulty is the same as in Dawn of Souls.</story>

      that this must be done as quickly as possible. Each stage has a gem requirement, and you can exit when you have
      found the required amount. The puzzles are usually based on colored gems that open specific doors.

      There are six worlds (including a tutorial) where you get past hazards such as water and quick sands, avoid
      patrolling creatures, collect gems, manipulate crates, sneak around, build bridges, and plant explosives. There
      are also power-ups that allow you to walk over certain surfaces, increase speed, or provide invincibility. With

    <story>Freak Out: Extreme Freeride is an arcade skiing game, focused on performing tricks and stunts. The main mode
      is Mission, where players need to jump gaps, make tricks, grind rails and pick stars. Completing the different
      challenges is rewarded with money, exchanged for basic equipment (skis, boots, helmets) and style equipment
      (jackets, goggles, gloves) at the shop. It also opens up new slopes and mountains. In Freeride the aim is to get
      the highest score, opening up slopes and mountains, there are four mountains in total, and earning endurance
      points. Bone Ride has the player collect bones against a time limit to earn balance points and beating courses in
      the Slope Style mode requires the player to reach a pre-defined score to receive trick skill points. These
      different game modes are grouped in the main Career, Single race and Multiplayer sections.

      Mostly about tricks, players need to take care of their landings - touch the ground with back, front or side
      weight and a lower score multiplier is awarded. Next to the basic information on the screen such as time, score
      and stunts, the game also keeps track of your "flow", by doing consecutive tricks. There are six different
      characters and the arsenal of tricks includes flips, rolls, carve/cross skis, grabs, rails, jumps and specials.

    <story>Full Auto 2: Battlelines is the sequel to the auto racing combat game Full Auto, that debuted in February of
      2006 on the Xbox 360.

      The PSP version of the sequel builds on the PS3 version but removes a few features for obvious reasons, resulting
      in more primitive damage modeling on the cars, less detailed environments and less multiplayer modes. This version
      does add new gameplay modes, new cars, weapons and a different storyline.

      The game plays much like a mixture of Burnout and Twisted Metal. The PSP version focuses more on the Twisted
      Metal-style combat gameplay. During most events, winning a race is rarely a goal; the game is focused on
      destruction. The goals change from level to level, but most time they require eliminating a set number of enemies,
      or blowing up specific targets, random objects, or oncoming traffic. Unlike the PS3 version every objective needs
      to be completed to win the event.

      The game contains two general game modes: Racing and Arena. The 'Unwreck' feature is also present and it allows
      the player to rewind time. The environment is however much less interactive. Most objects cannot be destroyed,
      only specific ones, for instance a lead pipe that lands on chasing cars. Most destruction is done to store fronts,
      bus stops, trash cans and other objects.

      The game contains four-player Ad Hoc multiplayer. Players can race or fight in a free-for-all arena or as part of
      a team in multiplayer modes such as Head-On, Down &amp; Back, as well as Arena Deathmatch.</story>

    <story>In Gangs of London the player takes the role of a crime gang member who wants to take control over London.
      The basic gameplay premise reminds of the GTA series but instead of a free roaming experience the campaign
      consists of 70 short missions which are chosen through a menu screen. Every of them is accompanied with a story
      sequence in a comic style and features varied goals: escorting, infiltrating an enemy post, stealing cars,
      kidnapping people, racing, defending the own position against enemy waves and killing people.

      The gameplay itself offers what one would expect from a game like this: if the player is on foot the game is
      basically a third person shooter - sometimes he has a few other gang members with him and can give them a few
      commands. The driving is action oriented in either first or third person and the stealth segments are basic and
      require only to perceive the guard's patrols and kill them from behind. The police intervenes if they see a crime
      but there is no wanted system like in similar games. At the beginning of the campaign the player has a choice
      between five gangs with different abilities, e.g. the Triads can drive faster.

      Additionally the game features a big selection of playing modes and mini games, e.g. free roaming in London,
      driving taxi, photographing points of interests as tourist or fighting off zombies. The mini games in the pub can
      be played with two players: darts, bowling, pool and a Snake variant as arcade machine, The last noteworthy mode
      is a tactical game similar to Risk: The player takes control over a crime organization and tries to conquer London
      which is divided into about 30 districts. In every round he can perform three actions, e.g. move men to another
      district. Between rounds he can hire more men or acquire bonus cards which give certain advantages. There are
      three difficulty levels and several winning conditions for this mode.</story>

      war ended, a man named Minister Zeo has taken control of the land of Dravania and has risen a massive army to
      bring peace and unity to the land.

      The gameplay is a mix of RPG, strategy and real-time battling, having the player take control of a set of
      characters and build and new kingdom in the Land of Duke, building up their kingdom and raise an army to defend
      themselves against invading kingdoms. They can also research new technologies and trade with neighboring kingdoms
      as well or even bribe off invading armies to keep them from attacking a weak kingdom.

      The battle modes consists of massive sixty character battles, with the ability to control their armies formations,
      having them stand defensively, aggressively or even a kamikaze stance where the will charge an enemy army head-on.

      the Marvel Comics character.

      You are Johnny Blaze, who sold his soul to a demon named Mephisto for noble reasons. Now, some rogue demons have
      escaped from hell and Mephisto needs to to destroy them before they cause him trouble. If you don't, he'll take
      your girlfriend back to hell with him.

      Ghost Rider attacks with his flaming hellfire chains in a manner similar to God of War. If he uses a variety of
      moves and avoids being hit, it fills a vengeance bar. The more this meter fills, the more souls he gets from
      enemies he kills. Souls are used to purchase new moves and extras like additional characters. There are some
      shielded enemies where you must have a minimum vengeance bar to damage them. There is also a spirit gauge, which
      is essentially a special meter and is also built up by attacking. It allows the uses of special moves, like your
      shotgun.

      There are also Hellcycle levels, where you must successfully avoid obstacles while destroying enemies with the
      bike's hellshots attacks and your chains.</story>

    <story>Gretzky NHL 06 for PSP is a hockey game endorsed by legendary player Wayne Gretzky. Released only six months
      after the previous PSP game, this version comes with updated rosters and several features taken from the PS2
      version, but has its own selection of modes.

      Returning modes include single games and a full season. The new chemistry feature makes its way over from the PS2,
      influencing players' stats depending on how well they interact with each other. Also seen on the PS2 is the "Wayne
      vs Wayne" mode, in which the two competing teams build up their "99 meter". When full, The Great One himself joins
      the team as an extra player for a short time. In addition to single games, this mode can also be played in the
      PSP-exclusive NHL Showdown mode, which is a ladder against all NHL teams, with the finale against a team of five
      Gretzkys. Another exclusive mode is called "3 on 3 Countdown". It is an arcade mode, with only three players per
      team on the field, without any of the regular rules, and the winner being the team that reaches a set score first.

      Online multiplayer, both ad hoc and via infrastructure, also return, as do the Gretzky Challenges: by earning
      points through in-game achievements, players can unlock bonuses like alternate and vintage uniforms and new
      gameplay features and modes. Unlike the previous PSP game, Gretzky 06 features color and play-by-play commentary

    <story>Wayfarer of Time features an isometric perspective and a "traditional RPG" style exploration in towns,
      dungeons and world map that are very similar to the original Growlanser. Enemies can be seen on the world map and
      they can be avoided. Each dungeon has a unique, fixed layout (with the exception of the "bonus dungeon", which is
      randomly generated).

      The equipment system is markedly different from most RPGs. Characters can equip two pieces of armor, one being a
      "Ring Weapon". In the Growlanser series, a Ring Weapon is a new technology where magic rings transform into
      different weapons depending on the user's personality. Players find these rings often after the defeat of an enemy
      and can equip different rings for different stat bonuses and different gem-equip slots. There are over 100 types
      of gems that cause various beneficial effects such as adding extra attacks, more elemental defenses, or increasing
      range or adding spells to the character's repertoire. These gems all have an innate level and that level must
      match or be lower than the slot available in the Ring weapon to be equipped. Each Ring Weapon only has 3 gem-slots
      with a level of 0-9 for each slot to equip the respective level gems. Additionally, a gem's color must match the
      color of a ring slot. A gem can be equipped into any given slot, however, penalties are incurred if the gem has a
      skill that can be learned.

      There are 11 potential playable characters, but there is a four-member party limit in battles. The fate system
      allow players to save some characters from death based on their decisions and ultimately unlock some additional
      endings.</story>

    <story>Hellboy: The Science of Evil is the second game adaptation of Mike Mignola's popular comic book character
      (now also featured in films and an animated series). The story is unique to the game, and sees Hellboy travel
      through six different settings as he tracks down the evil Von Klempt. Hellboy faces his familiar enemies including
      various demons and Nazi creations. The game features brawler style action, with some puzzle and story elements
      interspersed throughout.

      In The Science of Evil, Hellboy has several abilities that set him apart from the standard brawler character,
      including the ability to pick up and wield many environmental objects such as barrels and debris from structures
      knocked down with his Right Hand of Doom. He can also grapple enemies to finish them off one-on-one, or use them
      as projectiles.

      Team up with a friend and attempt six co-op multiplayer levels over ad-hoc WiFi. These levels are derived from the
      single-player campaign, but have been shortened and re-worked to provide a set of two-player puzzles. Scores are
      tracked individually - so it doesn't have to be completely co-operative.

      Hellboy: The Science of Evil was also released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, however the PSP version is not a
      port of that game. The story elements and characters are similar, but the PSP features a unique combat system,
      different AI and a new level layout more suited to the handheld environment.</story>

    <story>Hot Pixel is a casual game happening in a pixellized universe mixed from street culture, digital lifestyle
      and old-school style video games. It consists of 200 micro games, randomly selected from the pool in one mode, or
      grouped together into 10 episodes in a second mode, linked together by cut-scenes featuring the teenager DJON.

      Each micro game lasts only a few seconds, similar to the WarioWare games. During this short time limit, the player
      has to work out what he is supposed to do aided by a short sentence that appears when the game starts. There are
      also a number of tutorials and training modes. After clearing a set number of micro games the player is presented
      with a longer "boss" micro game which is generally more challenging in order to clear the level. Some of the games
      have suggestive themes or crude content.

      By going through the games, new ones are unlocked or presented with different modes, such as the removal of the
      time limit. Other features include a rating mode for the different characters, music jukebox, a list of unlocked
      video segments, and playlists to compile a list of favourite games or share it through the internet or memory
      sticks. The playlists come with 3 modes: Challenge (play through a selection), Survive (try to keep playing for a
      set amount of time) and Freeplay. There is an Ad Hoc multiplayer mode to compete against a friend for the best
      score. Playing well fills a gauge. When maxed out, it can be used to send a "disturber" that modifies the
      opponent's screen display.

      Some of the micro games use concepts of popular games such as Battlezone and Breakout. Additional games can be
      downloaded from the developer's website and are imported via a memory stick.</story>

      customized in the garage. Next to the performance upgrades, players can tweak the colors of the body, glass, neon,
      wheels, and change the wheels and decals.

      The Arcade Mode is further divided into different challenges: Quick Race, Survival Mode (complete a series of
      increasingly difficult races and avoid being kicked out), Collector (checkpoint-based races) and Time Trial.

      Next to regular racing controls such as brakes and acceleration, players can also use NOS (boost) and Slow Motion
      (slow down time during difficult sections). The use is limited as it depletes a reserve. It can be refilled by
      passing by obstacles without hitting them or completing tricky jumps. Tracks, with themes such as Volcano, Jungle
      or Death Valley, are generally filled with obstacles, moving objects or animals. The focus is entirely on racing,
      there are no weapons or other offensive means and the cars can only be slowed down, unable to sustain damage.

      There are three different camera settings and ghost cars are supported during time trials.</story>

    <story>IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey, or Wings of Prey on the PC, is a combat flight simulator video game. As with
      previous installments of the PC series IL-2 Sturmovik, it depicts combat aircraft from World War II, although with
      less focus on realistic simulation than other entries in the series.[2] The game has a campaign mode in which
      players are able to fly the Allies against the Axis, and also a multiplayer mode in which they are able to select
      either faction.[3] A demo of the game launched on the PSN and Xbox 360's Xbox Live on 29 July 2009.[4]

      Birds of Prey is based around the large-scale aerial combat and ground military operations of World War II.
      Players can participate in some of the warâ€™s most famous battles, piloting fighters, attack aircraft and heavy
      bombers across a range of missions. There are six theatres of war to engage in: The Battle of Britain, Stalingrad,
      Berlin, Sicily, Korsun and the Battle of the Bulge, representing the main airborne battles of World War II in
      Europe.

      Birds of Prey has a new damage effects engine. Players can see real-time damage to the aircraft such as holes in
      the wings and trail lines during dog fights. IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey features hundreds of aircraft taking
      part in air battles. The environmental engine also produces high-detail, realistic landscapes that allow players
      to easily see ground support actions.[5]

      The game was developed by Gaijin Entertainment, who subsequently developed Birds of Steel, also exclusively for
      consoles. Birds of Steel shares many traits with Birds of Prey (including HUD, aircraft models, controls, and menu
      design) but differentiates itself by concentrating primarily on USâ€“Japanese aerial battles of the Pacific
      theater.</story>

    <story>In six hours the evil Professor Elvin Atombender's nuclear missiles will launch and destroy strategic
      locations on the earth. Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission.

      The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender's Control Room in time
      to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four
      pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that
      Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten
      minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop
      them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few
      seconds.

      The 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and
      make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities.
      Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock,
      blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching
      or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms
      which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a
      "mixed" mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical
      upgrades.</story>

      zombie killing.

      It's Christmas time in New York and Zombies have come to ruin the festivities. As New York Cop Agent Stevens, you
      find out that not only are you immune to the zombie virus, but your blood is actually so powerful, it will make a
      zombie explode.

      The main focus of the gameplay is shooting holes in the zombies until they are weak enough for you to fire a vial
      of your own blood into them, causing an explosion. Weaken enough zombies, fire a blood vial into one, and watch
      the chain reaction as exploding zombies send your anti-zombie blood onto other zombies.

      The game was one of the first online PSP games, and featured a mode where defeating an opponent would give them
      your virus, and force their avatar online to look like your avatar. If they in turn defeated someone, your virus
      would be passed onto them as well. At any time you could look at a world map to see where on earth your strain of

    <story>Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven
      different platforms.

      The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius
      inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor
      instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them
      back.

      The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through more than 12 different missions and
      even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through
      cinematics between every mission and use the voices of actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence
      Howard.

      By foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using
      range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters,
      canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP
      blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful "Unibeam". Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems)
      are upgradeable, and there are many special armors from the comics to unlock in most of the versions.

      Differences in this version from the Xbox360/PS3 version consist of altered visuals and altered upgrade system
      (rather than spending money on them, the player's gear is upgraded based on how much it has been used).</story>

    <story>It is the 15th century, the time of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. A young French girl
      from the village of Domremy trying to assist her father with his daily labors discovers a mysterious object: an
      armlet that binds magically on her wrist. Soon the village is being attacked and finding the first sword she can,
      she steps forth to encounter the enemy, some humanoid beasts. Taking strength from the armlet, hearing a
      mysterious voice and having for assistance her close friends, she manages to defeat them and embarks on a long
      quest to help her countrymen and vanquish the evil forces invading France.

      Jeanne d'Arc is a turn-based strategy RPG game of the Japanese variety, that fuses medieval history with fantasy
      and the craziness of Japanese anime. This is a well known story retold through tactical battles one after another,
      while game dialog along with hand drawn cutscenes twist the story into different territories from the original.

      It is a story of teen friendship and dedication, remorseless war, evil magic, unavoidable death, heartache
      abandonment and purifying hope. Jeanne joins the army and along with 14 other companions with different skills and
      personalities march to face England's Henry VI's troops. With her are other armlet wielders, able to use them and
      transform into fearsome warriors able to strike down evil at its core. The game features a map to move through
      locations where the battles which push the story forward happen along with free stages that add nothing more than
      fun, strong items and difficult bosses.</story>

    <story>Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a remake of the original Tomb Raider with a technically more advanced
      graphics engine. It has the same basic storyline, though some cutscenes and much of the dialogue within have been
      expanded or modified in other ways. Locations correspond to those of the original version and are accessed in the
      same order, but have been re-designed with different layouts and mostly completely different puzzles which allow
      implementation of new moves introduced in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend: swinging on ropes and using a grappling
      hook at specific points.

      Puzzles are generally more focused on acrobatics in this version, ledges being much more prominently featured as a
      level design element, requiring combinations of jumping and shimmying across them to access areas. This type of
      gameplay replaces the key-retrieval and block-pushing puzzles of the original almost entirely. Combat is similar
      to that of the first game, though the player must now manually activate targeting. Some boss fights have been made
      a separate enclosed stage rather than being part of the exploration as in the original version. These fights may
      have puzzle-solving elements and often require the player to use Lara's new "adrenaline dodge" ability, which
      slightly slows down time when the opponent charges at her while in an "enraged" state. Some cutscenes require the
      player to participate in quick-time events.</story>

    <story>Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy is a multi-platform action-adventure video game developed by
      Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts and TT Games. It was released on September 11, 2006. Part of the Lego
      Star Wars series, it is based on the Star Wars science fiction media franchise and Lego Group's Star Wars-themed
      toy line. It follows the events of the Star Wars films Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
      The game allows players to assume the roles of over 50 Lego versions of characters from the film series;
      customized characters can also be created. Camera movement was improved from its predecessorâ€”Lego Star Wars: The
      Video Game; and the concept of "vehicle levels" was explored more thoroughly. The game was revealed at American
      International Toy Fair 2006. Promotions for the game were set up at chain stores across the United States.

      Lego Star Wars II was critically and commercially successful; it has sold over 8.2 million copies worldwide as of
      May 2009. Critics praised the game for its comedic and "adorable"[2][3] portrayal of the film series and for their
      preference of the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy. However, the game's low difficulty, and its Game Boy
      Advance and Nintendo DS versions in general, were received more poorly. The game received awards from the British
      Academy of Film and Television Arts and Spike TV, among others. A mobile phone adaptation was later developed by
      Universomo, published by THQ, and released on December 19, 2006. Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars II were
      compiled in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, released on November 6, 2007. The OS X version of the game was
      released in April 2007 by Feral Interactive.[4]</story>

      of lemmings through increasingly complex levels. The creatures cannot be controlled directly, but you can assign
      skills to them, such as diving, bashing, building... to make them reach the end of the level unharmed.

      In addition to original scenarios, the PSP version has 36 new levels. It also includes a map builder that allows

    <story>This is a collection of mini-games based on the UK comedy sketch TV series Little Britain that ran between
      2003 and 2006. The included games are based on some of the scenes and recurring characters. It also includes the
      original voices of the two leads and the narrator. Players need to unlock the different games by competing in a
      Tour with three difficulty levels. On Easy, for each 50,000 points another game is opened up and clips from the
      series are unlocked. The included games are set at different, fictitious locations in Britain and require a lot of
      button mashing:
      Darkley Noone: Vicky Pollars needs to complete two laps on roller-skates in a skate park. She has to collect CDs
      to throw a party, while avoiding hazard, performing tricks when jumping in the air, and grinding on rails.

      Herby: Lou and Andy go to the swimming pool, but as soon as they are there, Andy doesn't like it. While Lou
      explains to a guard how he wants his handicapped friend get to swim, Andy need to dive off diving boards and
      perform tricks. There are three boards to choose from and he needs to get back in his wheelchair before time runs
      out.

      Sessex: Weight Watcher guide Marjorie runs around in a supermarket collecting cookies in a Pac-Man-style
      mini-game. The ghosts are represented by fatties she needs to avoid, but by picking up cake (similar to the
      original power pellets), she can take them out for a short time.

      Slut: Letty has to squash all the frogs in her living room, making sure not to hit any other objects. Gameplay is
      similar to the Whac-A-Mole concept, except that the frogs jump around instead of popping up.

      Old Haven: Emily, a real lady, needs to score a number of goals in a game of football (soccer) before time runs
      out. She needs to progress over the pitch step by step and avoid hitting the defenders as that returns her to the
      starting location. She does get points for shooting them in their private parts. The PSP version is slightly
      different as it is presented as a game of penalty kicks, without defenders. The direction and the force of the
      kick can be determined separately.

      Pox: make matches of three identical items collecting food in Maggie's gullet as she gulps it down. Once it is
      full, she can spew out all the food over her friends at the party for extra points.

      Llandewi Breffi: Dafydd Thomas is the only gay in the village and needs to prove it. He rides a bicycle through
      the streets and needs to collect copies of Gay Magazine while running down other people and slapping fake gays.
      The PSP version contains an additional game:
      Flatley: help "Eh Eh Eh" Anne at the psychiatric institute to destroy the flowers in the garden. She can stamp
      them, pull them out, and then smash it or chuck it. She needs to avoid the men in white coats that chase after
      her. She can temporarily stun them by flashing them when she lifts her skirt.</story>

    <story>The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest is a 2010 action-adventure video game developed by Headstrong Games
      for Wii, and TT Fusion for Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. It was published on
      all platforms by WB Games.

      The game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy; The Fellowship of the Ring (2001),
      The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). Set fifteen years after the War of the Ring, the game
      features Samwise Gamgee telling his children of the adventures of Aragorn during the conflict; his stories form
      the majority of the game's content. Aragorn's Quest was the first Lord of the Rings game released by WB Games, who
      had acquired the rights to make games based on the New Line Cinema film series from Electronic Arts in 2009.

      The game was aimed primarily at younger players, offering a simplified and less violent version of the plots of
      the three films. It received mixed to negative reviews, with critics finding the combat repetitive, the narrative
      too truncated and the overall game too easy.</story>

    <story>The Lord of the Rings: Tactics is a completely original strategy game set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Players
      experience the entire trilogy, from the earliest battle at Weathertop to the final conclusion at Minas Tirith and
      Mordor.

      Unlike other tactics games, which are strictly straightforward turn-based affairs, The Lord of the Rings: Tactics
      innovates in its system. Players assign their moves simultaneously with the AI, and then all the actions unfold.
      In this way, players must guess their opponent's intentions and try to block them before they actually happen.
      This keeps the action moving much faster than a traditional tactics game.</story>

    <story>The sequel to the Lumines stays close the original puzzle game, but add some twists. The gameplay is
      identical: you arrange blocks, made of four smaller block pieces with two colours in total, to form shapes with an
      identical colour, as a square of four pieces or more. The blocks can be rotated and are stacked with the other
      blocks on the board. A vertical line crosses the screen and when it hits the right side, all combinations are
      removed, causing chain combos and clearing the board. You have to prevent the blocks from piling up and reaching
      the top of the screen. There are also special blocks you can use to remove many blocks at once. Games are played
      against colorful backgrounds and the speed of the timeline matches the music of the level, while the falling speed
      of the blocks increases as you get further in the game.

      The game modes are either new or have been remixed. In the single-player Challenge mode, there are three
      difficulty classes. By clearing levels you unlock new music, skins and game modes. One of these are the Endurance
      challenge runs, where you have to play through all skins in the game. Next to games with regular skins, some
      backgrounds now have 3D animations or show music videos of popular artists. The sound effects and the design of
      blocks is often adapted to fit the music. For levels with music video skins, you cannot play through them at a
      quicker pace to clear the level as you have to keep going until the song ends.

      The other single-player modes are Time Attack mode (get a high score with limited time, you can even record your
      session) and Puzzle mode where you need to create shapes. You can also challenge the computer in the VS CPU Mode.
      Here, you need to score more than your opponent to make his playing field smaller until he gets stuck. This game
      type is also available as the Duel mode against a human player through Wi-Fi. The order of the skins can be
      defined in the new Skin Edit mode. The Single Lap section allows you to make your own playlists for a set run,
      while the Endless Lap allows you to choose or exclude skins to keep playing as long as you like. There are 60
      levels and 100 skins in total.

      Another new feature is the Mission mode where more strategy is required. You are given specific tasks to clear
      boards with a limited amount of blocks or time. In the new Sequencer mode, you can compose your own songs. The
      game provides options to define the speed and 8 separate music sheets to place notes and effects on. The high
      scores, playlists from the Skin Edit mode, songs from the Sequencer mode and replays of the Time Attack mode can
      be exchanged with other players through Wi-Fi. Your performance is tracked in the Database mode where statistics
      of your playing sessions are available. The game also includes a demo of Every Extend Extra, another puzzle game

    <story>Major League Baseball 2K9 is a simulation of the sport of baseball. The heart of the game is the franchise
      mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping
      the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics, player trading and
      hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every player has other wishes for
      his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player's club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less
      salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value
      influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider.

      Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For
      pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement
      (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the
      ball's direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the
      direction in which he should throw the ball.
      Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs).
      Players can unlock training cards.

      The are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly
      with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the
      franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on
      PSP.</story>

    <story>Manhunt 2 does not build upon the story and events of the first game. Instead, the same game mechanics are
      transferred to a new location, the Dixmor Insane Asylum, where the staff prefers to beat up the patients and
      experiment on them, rather than to offer treatment for their illness. One day a power outage allows the patients
      to revolt and bring mayhem to the asylum. The player gets the chance to play two roles: as Dr. Daniel Lamb and Leo
      Kasper. Although the beginning is set inside the asylum, the action soon moves to other locations.

      The game mechanics are largely stealth oriented, while later levels offer more of a regular third-person shooter
      feel when more firearms become available. Gunplay requires extensive use of cover, maneuvers and sometimes stealth
      for success. There is a radar system, enemies have different levels of awareness and kills are best performed from
      the shadows. Players can throw objects to distract enemies or make noises into the USB headset to lure them away
      from their friends (PS2). To hide in the dark a quick mini-game needs to be performed. If it is not completed in
      time, the character's location will be revealed at once.

      As in the first game players can perform executions, with three styles: Hasty (white), Violent (yellow) and
      Gruesome (red). These feature explicit violence including strangling, beatings, gun violence, setting them on fire
      and more. Some of these kills are however censored with blacked out scenes or the camera turning away. In the Wii
      version player need to mimic the motions needed for a kill with the combination of the Wiimote and the Nunchuk.

      All versions are quite similar. The Wii edition includes three exclusive weapons (bottle, mace and a razor), while
      the other two versions have a weapon not found in the Wii game: a samurai sword. The Wii version is also the only
      one to include a short tutorial to familiarize the player with the controls. Other small changes in the Wii
      edition include more detailed environments, additional dialogue, new hunters (Sexual Deviants scene), some changes
      in weapon placement, a new manhole execution (in Ghosts), and more animations for Daniel and Leo, especially in
      close combat.</story>

    <story>Dr. Doom has united supervillains as the Masters of Evil. Now for the first time ever, over 20 Marvel
      superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come
      together to stop Doom. Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the
      Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide
      additional bonuses.

      Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a
      level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on
      boosts for your hero team.

      You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with
      punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by
      combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes.

      Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as
      well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.

      The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's
      gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly
      identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.</story>

    <story>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and,
      before that, the X-Men Legends series It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics.
      After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of
      civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered
      individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or
      anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose
      the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.

      You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which will give
      you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they
      get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD access points, usually
      at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina meter recharges on its own and
      controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending
      on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like
      jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use
      powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You
      can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.

      Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading
      statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or
      a bonus to a specific type of damage.

      The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. This is
      controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that instantly fills
      the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a fusion attack. Any
      possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic types:

      There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a single
      target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting
      off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of
      enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then
      running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies.

    <story>Set a century after the events in the original Mega Man series, Mega Man Maverick Hunter X is a remake of the
      original SNES game Mega Man X, and details the story of Dr. Light's greatest creation: X, a robot with free will.
      Dr. Cain's discovery of X led to the creation of reploids, robots modeled after the design of X. When the maverick
      virus infects a group of reploids, they band together in a revolt against humanity. The call goes to the maverick
      hunters, X and Zero, to fight the Mavericks.

      The game is a side-scrolling action game where the player controls X as he hunts the maverick reploids. Notable
      features include the ability to find enhancements to augment X's abilities, and the ability to absorb the powers
      of the maverick reploids X defeats. The original moves, such as dashes, wall jumps and charge shorts are still
      present.

      The original flat backgrounds have been replaced by polygonal models, and the remake features enhanced explosions
      and generally more detail. Additionally, animated cutscenes and voice acting have been added. All weapon and
      armour upgrades have been relocated to new hidden areas, and there is a new mode: Vile, in which you can play the
      entire game as maverick Vile, with abilities Mega Man does not have. As a bonus, there is a demo of Mega Man
      Powered Up on the UMD - a remake of the very first Mega Man game.</story>

    <story>Dr. Light had an idea: He would build a bunch of good and handy robots to help him and others to make the
      world a better place. One of these robots is named "Mega" and is designed to help Light around the lab in various
      tasks. One day, evil Dr. Wily attacks the lab and turn all of the robots evil too. All except Mega. Dr. Light
      sends Mega to stop these robots and thus, Mega Man is born.

      Mega Man: Powered Up is a semi-remake of the original Mega Man.
      There is an "Old Mode", where one tackles the adventure just like it was in the olden days, with the exception of
      an added feature to save game. The graphics are souped up, but the level layout is basically the same than in the
      original with a few minor changes here and there.
      Then there's the "New Mode" which also features the original level themes and bosses but the levels themselves are
      boosted with various hidden areas and features which are mostly impossible to get to with Megaman only. The Player
      must defeat the bosses after which they'll be available as playable characters and use their special abilities to
      find everything in every level.

      The third mode is the Challenge Mode where there is 100 different challenges to tackle and in which one has to
      dispatch as many enemies as possible in a given amount of time, get to the specific goal in a given amount of time
      and so on.

      In addition to these two main game modes, there is a level editor that can be used to build the Megaman level of
      one's dreams and play it or send it to the internet where other gamers can download and play it.</story>

    <story>Mercury Meltdown is the sequel to Archer Maclean's Mercury, a puzzle game where your job is to guide a blob
      of mercury, or several blobs, along various mazes, by tilting the game world, while hazard try to zap, attract,
      repulse, eat, or blow you up.

      Mercury Meltdown features a new vibrant visual style, a lot of completely new stages, a free-look camera, ghost
      mercuries and replays for your best times that can be saved, and much more. The game's original realistic graphics
      have been turned into a more cartoon style. The mercury now has a black line around the outside of it.

      The main change in the game is the ability to change the mercury into 3 more states. Besides normal state now you
      can turn the mercury into the "Fast" or "Slow" using a heater and a cooler, and using a solidifier you can make it
      unto "Solid" state, a round, non-breakable ball. The mercury can still be split using a splitter, needed to solve
      certain puzzles.

      Unlike the original Mercury, the game is split into themed "Labs" rather than “Worlds”. There are 10 Labs, with 16
      initial stages: Astro, Bio, Chemical, Electro, Geo, Atom, Aero, Hydro, Micro, V.R. (Virtual Reality). The PS2
      version adds two more: Chrono and Cryo, as well as twin analog control, support for the rumble feature, improved
      graphics and all the levels from the original Archer Maclean's Mercury. There are 168 stages in the PSP version
      and over 200 in the PS2 game. Unlike the previous game, there is no strict order to play the levels. Once a Lab
      has been unlocked, you can play all the stages included right away.

      Attributes show how well you do in the games. The best performance is awarded with a golden cork, based on four
      conditions: a high score (a 1 sticker), all bonus items found (a star sticker), 100% mercury (a corked test-tube),
      and complete the level within the time limit. While playing, your progress is measured in faces that replace the
      time clock. The time limit cannot cause the game to end anymore, instead it just turns into a sad face and players
      can still complete the level. The mercury limits have also been removed, but 100% mercury is still needed to
      access some of the later stages.

      The top right corner shows a color chart, to help with mixing colors in the game. This can also be done in the
      paintshop. This release adds multi-paintshops, triangle base pyramid shaped constructions with 3 different
      coloured gates on either side.

      In addition to the main game, there are now five party games, which are unlocked by collecting the bonus stars in
      the main game:

      1. Metrix: puzzle games where coloured blocks need to be fit inside a pre-defined grid.

      2. Paint: move the mercury to paint the tray as much as possible against your opponent.

      3. Race: guide mercury around speedy track with boost pads and avoid falling off.

      4. Rodeo: tilt the playing area to keep the mercury on the field, while a fan tries to knock you off.

      2. Shove: aim the mercury for the center spot of the target, just like curling.

      All the party games can be played in multiplayer over Wi-Fi on the PSP. The tutorial is now separate from the main
      game, and there is an additional Playground mode where you can test the different items in the game.</story>

      and kept for several days, in which they may increase in value, thus making a profit for the player. Additionally,

    <story>One of the first Sony MLB licensed games to be on the PSP, it features all the major league teams at the time
      as well as the top players for its day with brand new animations designed for the PSP. The game can be considered
      a slimmed down version of MLB 2006. It has the standard game modes, Quick Game, Season Mode as well as a
      Multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other using the Ad Hoc.

      Some of the new gameplay mechanics for the game areRelease Point Pitching with Confidence meter which would
      determine the success rate of the pitcher depending on the stats and skill of the player. The more successful
      pitches made within a certain zone, the easier the pitches become, missing them cause wild pitches or pitch a line
      drive right to the batter.

      Another is the Playmaker Fielding Marker, where unlike other games this one used the players stats to determine if
      regular plays like pop-ups would be considered easy by giving the player ample opportunity by showing the landing
      location faster and giving it a more wider area. Less skilled players would be given less of a warning and a
      smaller catching radius, making even the simplest plays more challenging.

      The Branch Point Technology introduced a seamless flow of transition for the game that allowed the player to plan
      out the direction of a throw while still in the process of catching it and was also used for baserunning that gave
      it a smoother feel to running and sliding.</story>

    <story>Monster Hunter Freedom is a port of the Japan-only Monster Hunter G, a sort of follow-up to the original
      Monster Hunter - more of a director's cut of the game. While a good deal of the game mirrors the Playstation 2
      original, there have been a large number of additions. There are now more quests, more monsters, more weapons,
      more armor and more areas around town to use to your advantage.

      You now have a farm that sits just outside of town. You'll have access to some mining veins, bug catching spots, a
      dock for catching fish and a garden. This means that now you can gather materials when you're between missions,
      which doesn't eliminate the need to gather things while on the hunt, but it does make it less of a hassle. Another
      extra area is the training school. Here you can partake in hunts with specific limitations; you have a specified
      item and equipment layout, and have to take on larger prey within a shorter time limit. It's tough to be sure, but
      it also opens up the ability to produce some very special and powerful new weapons.

      There are some insanely difficult hunts you can take later in the game. As for the new creatures, they run the
      gamut from having added colors (with new armor options to match) to totally new monsters (like a battle-worn
      wyvern with a huge mean streak). As an added bonus, not only can you make new types of armor from these new
      critters, but you can (in some cases) make more armor from classic monsters.

      The controls on the PSP are a little different. While the PSP does lack two shoulder buttons and a second analog
      stick, players just press two face buttons instead of swinging the right analog stick. Triangle, Circle, and
      Triangle and Circle combined unleash three different types of attacks, while holding the right shoulder button
      blocks (or charges to attack if you're using a hammer). Multiplayer is limited to Ad-Hoc, so no going online to
      form a hunting party.</story>

    <story>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from,
      who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of
      an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page.
      Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're
      here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

      Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger.
      Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its
      mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by
      clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the
      game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

      The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

      The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and
      re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</story>

    <story>Another update of EA's perennial NCAA collegiate football franchise, this edition features updated rosters
      and stats. It also has new features such as a momentum meter, the more players either in favor or against a team,
      the more the meter will light up or darken, affecting the teams morale and success of plays. It also has a new
      kicking meter along with spring drills, letting players update their stats along with a new Spring Game where
      players can scout out their new players in exhibition games.

      Aside from the PSP version, Campus Legend is also a novelty - an update of the Race for the Heisman mode of the
      previous edition and it is quite similar to the NFL Superstar mode from the Madden franchise. A new player starts
      at football camp, practises and is eventually awarded a scholarship to play in a division. Rather than a single
      drill, it is now a series of four. Where in the previous version players could choose a scholarship, the game now
      offers a selection from the available schools based on the performances. Once enrolled, players choose a major,
      follow progress reports, read headlines in the school newspaper and have a dorm room where fan mail arrives. The
      player's girlfriend, shown as a photo of the wall, becomes more beautiful based on the success in the games. Days
      consist of attending classes, practice, studying, meeting tutors, drills or social activities. These can also
      boost popularity and overall success. Characters can be uploaded to Madden 07 where it can determine their draft
      position. The game is also aligned with ESPN, updating with real news from ESPN Radio and ESPN.com. It features
      the voice talents of Lee Corso, Brad Nessler and Kirk Herbstreit.

      The 360 version lacks the Spring Drills and Campus Legend modes. Instead it has improved graphics and a series of

    <story>The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny Funny, and going out on a date
      with her. But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test,
      cooking and more, all in order to get the girl. And remember - You Gotta Believe!

      PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm. The game itself is very basic - each stage has a
      'teacher', that PaRappa must follow. You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the
      teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back. Rap well, and you'll be able to continue;
      fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased. Continue to mess
      up and you'll fail the stage.

      Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in
      the song's gaps. Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the
      teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!

      The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original. However, it includes a few upgrades, such as
      a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of
      song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.</story>

    <story>Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and
      numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in
      the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the
      ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help
      her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's
      guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.

      The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she
      can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object
      on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom
      in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a
      phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By
      defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.</story>

    <story>Pilot Academy is a flight simulator on the PSP which encompasses all eras of flight, ranging from historic
      WWI fighter planes such as the famous Fokker Triplane (flown by the "Red Baron" Manfred von Richthofen) to modern
      military and civilian jet aircraft like the F-15, F-16 and Boeing 747. All aircraft names and designs are
      licensed.

      In the initial lessons, the game teaches the player the basics of powered flight for both civilian and military
      purposes. The game uses all PSP buttons to deliver a flight simulation feel with the analog nub serving as a
      joystick. Controlling the flaps, air brakes, raising and lowering the landing gear as well as using the tail
      rudder are also possible. Military aircraft feature air-to-ground missiles, air-to-air-missiles, a machine gun and
      flares for self defense against missiles. The only thing missing from the simulation is a fuel gauge, but since
      most missions are rather short, this was probably a deliberate design choice.

      After civilian and military flight lessons are completed, the player is free to choose from various missions and
      challenges. Completing a task successfully unlocks new aircraft in the player's hangar which can then be flown any
      time in free flight mode (but only on the tropical map). Distinctions are also awarded for completion of a mission
      based on time taken, aircraft integrity, completion of objectives and level of excitement/comfort of passengers
      (if any) and determine the level of proficiency of the player pilot.

      Flights take place over different types of terrain including tropical, desert, snow covered mountains and canyons
      and in varying weather conditions like rain, snow and even in a storm. Some missions begin while already airborne,
      while others require the player to taxi onto the runway, takeoff and land after completing the objective.

      Multiplayer supports up to four players dogfighting against each other or cooperatively with planes from any of
      the four military eras, e.g. a dogfight between a WWII propeller plane like the P-51 Mustang or the Spitfire
      versus an F-14 Tomcat or F-16 Falcon is possible.</story>

    <story>PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 (also known as PQ2; Intelligent License 2 in Japan) is a puzzle game
      for the PlayStation Portable, and a sequel to PQ: Practical Intelligence Quotient. The game is based on testing
      the model of human intelligence developed by Dr. Masuo Koyasu at Kyoto University.

      PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ game and similar platform-like
      puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping
      from levels, lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and lifts, block laser
      beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds
      on the level.

      The main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is given a total cumulative time of 5
      hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player
      can save and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on the number of "moves"
      (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took to complete it, and the number of attempts at that
      stage. A player can skip a stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also
      penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score to worldwide scoring tables to
      compare their results.

      Obstacles in levels include:

      Boxes. Small opaque boxes can be picked up and dropped, and their height is the maximum height that the avatar can
      climb up on, thus these are commonly used to make stairs. Larger boxes can be pushed or pulled.
      Glass boxes. These boxes operate like regular boxes, but will shatter if dropped from any height or hit by
      something dropped on them. They also are translucent and will allow both laser and regular light through.
      Laser boxes. Like regular boxes but have laser beams that come out of one end. Crossing the beams will prematurely
      end the level.
      Switch panels and switch boxes. Colored switches, when active, will activate platforms that may move across the
      field or that increase height, while deactivating a switch will cause these platforms to return to their original
      position. Floor panels are active by stepping on them or placing a box on them, while switch boxes require a laser
      beam to hit them.
      Teleporters. These can be moved like boxes and will teleport the avatar between the end points.
      Police officers. These characters roam from one police call box to the next closest one, and shine a line in front
      of them. Should the avatar be caught in this light, the level must be restarted. The police call boxes can be
      moved to alter the police officier's behavior.
      Detectives. These characters will follow a specific roaming path until they discover footprints left by the
      avatar. At this point, they will follow the footprints until either the trail is lost, they find an obstacle they
      cannot pass through, or until they catch the avatar (which then will restart the level). Footprints will disappear
      after a number of steps, but can also be manipulated by using boxes and other obstacles.
      PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 introduces the ability to create one's own levels to share with friends,
      and a "weekly quiz" that can be downloaded through the Internet.</story>

    <story>In Prinny: Can I Really Be The Hero? players are treated to a single player spin-off from the popular
      role-playing universe of Disgaea. Here players step into the unlucky shoes of a penguin called a Prinny and 999 of
      his comrades as you slash your way through various Netherworld areas in side-scrolling service to the Demon Lord
      Etna. Although the mission that you are saddled with, finding ingredients for the ultimate desert, is ridiculously
      comic, the action you face is not, so you're given 1,000 lives to work with and you can use everything you find on
      the battlefield to help you survive and succeed.</story>

    <story>Five different gangs are terrorizing the cities, namely Warlords, Capelli Family, Killer66, Vixens, and
      Convicts. Cities are in chaos as the regular police is helpless. Therefore, a special unit is formed to deal with
      such a threat, a special unit called the Pursuit Force. You are part of that unit.

      Your task is to hunt down the criminals and let none escape. To do so, you will drive your fast car on the streets
      while being perfectly able to switch the vehicles on the run. Yes, on the run, you can jump from car to car during
      high speed, usually jumping on the different cars from the criminals and taking them out one by one. But there's
      more to that than just driving different cars, you can drive motorcycles, trucks, boats, even commandeer a
      helicopter, though there are occasions you'll have to deal with the criminals on foot.

      You can select Time Trial, Race, or Career mode. The latter one plays story-wise which gives you certain variety
      of cases to choose from. As you get promoted while successfully solving the cases, new cases will become available
      depending upon your rank, from mere Officer to police Commander. This is a highly fast-paced game with non-stop
      action, as most missions leave very little room for mistakes.</story>

    <story>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the
      students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make
      their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game
      of, Puyo Pop!

      A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining
      four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will
      fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be
      exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

      When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting
      the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you
      will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos
      to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

      Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows
      up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</story>

    <story>Puzzle Chronicles is a casual game that combines item-matching puzzling with RPG elements, including
      character progression and a fantasy story line in the vein of Infinity's earlier titles Puzzle Quest: Challenge of
      the Warlords and Puzzle Kingdoms.

      The puzzle part is played on a board with vertical divider line in the middle. The goal is to push the divider
      line back to decrease the opponent's territory until no more moves are possible. This is done by matching groups
      of three gems into like colours along the divider line. These groups fall on the board horizontally. Pushing the
      divider line back is done by destroying rage gems. There are also special abilities and a sidekick known as a
      Warbeast that attacks the enemy when a sufficient amount of gems of certain colour has been cleared.

      Removing gems also enables the player to collect mana, power spells and items that are then used to attack the
      opponent and reduce their board space. In addition to the main puzzle game, there are five other mini-games
      ranging from upgrading the Warbeast companion to crafting new items, while navigating a number of different maps
      and completing simple quests.</story>

    <story>Rainbow Islands Evolution is a game in the Bubble Bobble series for the PSP system. It is also known as New

      Bub and Bob, the two main characters in the series, are against an evil recording company that seeks to pollute
      the Rainbow Islands' atmosphere by creating constant musical noise, therefore wilting the flora and mutating the
      fauna. In this game, Bub and Bob use a hurdy-gurdy (an old European musical instrument) as a weapon to create the
      rainbows.

      The game follows the same vertical-scrolling system from the original, but it expands to a third dimension as
      there are platforms in the background which become accessible through the course of the game.

      The game suffers from reviews stating that it had been overworked with new features, especially those that make
      this version of the game differ significantly from the original game.</story>

    <story>Brian Lara 2007: Pressure Play is the first PSP incarnation of the Codemasters series of Brian Lara cricket
      games. It has simple controls and an arcade feel. Gameplay largely involves pressing a button at the right time to
      hit a shot, take a catch, return a throw, and bowl a good delivery.

      The 'Pressure Play' in the title refers to a new game mode that was introduced for the PSP version. Pressure Plays
      are essentially challenges requiring the player to complete a given task within certain defined parameters. Early
      Pressure Plays involve bowling no extras, or playing block shots. Later Pressure Plays involve famous run chases,
      holding out for rain, and hitting six sixes off an over.

      The game supports ad-hoc PSP multiplayer for 2 players, but does not support game sharing. Additionally, the game
      focuses exclusively on one-day internationals, with no option to play tests, 20-20s, or county cricket.</story>

      Portable. The game is developed by Backbone Entertainment in conjunction with Harmonix and is distributed by MTV
      Games and Electronic Arts. The game was released in North America and Europe on June 9, 2009.

      The core game is functionally similar to the note-matching gameplay of Harmonix's previous titles, Frequency and
      Amplitude, with the player responsible for playing all four instrumentsâ€”lead and bass guitar, drums, and
      vocalsâ€”using the Portable's controls. Game modes are similar to Rock Band's, and the soundtrack includes a
      number of songs that have already been a part of the Rock Band series. Additional tracks will be a time-limited
      exclusive to Unplugged before they are released as downloadable content for the console games. The game supports
      the addition of new songs that can be purchased through the PlayStation Store.

      Rock Band Unplugged, in addition to being released separately, was also released as part of a "Limited Edition
      Entertainment Pack" that also includes a Rock Band Unplugged-branded PSP, a 4GB memory card, and a voucher to
      download the movie School of Rock. A voucher for an exclusive 5-song demo of "Rock Band Unplugged" that is

    <story>Samurai Warriors: State of War (æ¿€ãƒ»æˆ¦å›½ç„¡å Œ, Geki Sengoku Musou) is a portable version of Samurai
      Warriors, however, it is not a straight conversion. It is more like Dynasty Warriors for the PlayStation Portable,
      giving it an "Empires" style of playing.

      The gameflow is mainly separated into two stages: the Strategy phase and the Action phase. During the first stage,
      the map is separated into colored squares and the player is asked to move their character in a turn-based fashion.
      Terrain affects how the player can act during this stage. What usually follows is the action phase, which asks the
      player to defeat as many opponents possible within 60 seconds. These stages can tip the battle in the player's
      favor.

      There are four main armies for the player to participate in: the Takeda (Western), Uesugi (Eastern), Nobunaga, or
      the solo army. Completing the game with these four factions unlocks the final stage in the game. It guest stars
      characters from Dynasty Warriors 4. The game features a Story mode, Free mode and VS mode.</story>

      player takes the role of one of 27 licensed athletes and compete in 13 of the race locations of the season
      2008/2009 (the NÃ¼rburgring is not in available). There are up to eight sessions per race, including free training
      and warm ups. In the garage the player can tune almost every aspect of his bike in detail. Beginners this can be
      delegated to an engineer. Of course there is also the option to play just a single racing weekend or to start in a
      quick race.

      In comparison to its predecessor there are two notable changes: driving helps for novice players and 20
      challenges. In these the player either has to solve certain problems in pre-defined situations, e.g. winning the
      race with worn out brakes or reaching checkpoints in a limited time frame.</story>

    <story>Valkyria Chronicles III, is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Sega for the PlayStation
      Portable. It is the third game in the Valkyria Chronicles series and was released on January 27, 2011 exclusively
      in Japan. An expanded version of the game, subtitled Extra Edition was released in Japan on November 23, 2011.

      Occurring in the same time frame as the first game, Valkyria Chronicles III is a side story that follows the
      exploits of an unwanted and castigated Gallian Army squad during the Imperial invasion of 1935. Contrasting the
      previous games' bright outlook and recognition for their protagonists, Valkyria Chronicles III explores the themes
      of being outcast and the search for redemption. As described by its catchphrase, the game tells "The tale of
      nameless soldiers who, on the verge of despair, changed history."</story>

      diner. However, he is resurrected by Homunculus (voiced by Charles Martinet in English), a djinn or genie, who
      offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him the time-traveling digipad. Eike explores four
      erasâ€”2001, 1980, 1902 and 1580â€”as he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own
      murder at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several characters: Dana, a modern-day
      waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the year 1580 and loses; the present-day fortune teller, who tells
      Eike the hour of his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private art museum who lost his wife and infant daughter
      in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in 1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children,
      Hugo and Margarette; and Alfred Brum, the great-grandfather of Eckart.

      Given a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus' instructions to give the stone to Wagner. Time-traveling
      ten days later, Eike discovers that the result of Wagner's experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already
      upset by his mother's death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track Eike down with the
      intent of killing him. Depending on the player's actions, Hugo holds either Margarette or Dana hostage in the

    <story>Shaun White Snowboarding gives the player, as the title suggests, a snowboard and sends him off to four ski
      run locations around the world (Europe, Alaska, Japan and a fictitious location called Park City) under the
      watchful eye of professional snowboarder Shaun White himself as well as other professionals, moderators, pilots
      and such. But before the player can go on the slope, he has to create his character by choosing not only from
      different body looks but also from different clothes and snowboards.

      During the course of the game the player earns money by completing the challenges which can in return be invested
      in more stylized clothes and additional types of snowboards. Each of the boards has six stats like balance or
      speed and not all of them are the best possible option for every given situation. While in a race speed is an
      important factor, a board with a higher rating in rotation allows for better stunts.

      The game puts the player in an open world with him free to roam around the slope as he pleases. Several lifts and
      even a helicopter bring him to different starting locations but if he wants, he can also walk and discover hidden
      areas by doing so. By doing tricks, with controls using mainly the analog sticks similar to Skate, the player
      earns respect points. And on the track are, besides many obstacles to perform tricks on, challenges like the
      Jibfest, in which only tricks on rails and boxes count or Freestyle in which every trick counts. Others include
      the Death Race, in which the player needs to get to the goal before everyone else but as the name suggests,
      everything is allowed including ramming opponents and throwing snowballs to get them off-balance. There are also
      some challenges like King of the Hill that can only be done with at least one other human player joining in.

      The multiplayer mode is basically an extension of the single player experience. Everything that is available in
      single player, can also be done with other players online or over LAN. The other players are also just dropped
      into the open world with the freedom to just do what they want on the server.</story>

    <story>Sid Meier's Pirates! for the PSP is a mix between the PC and Xbox version that were released two and three
      years earlier, respectively. As a straight port, not much has changed except for three really notable elements.

      First, the dancing sequences have been tweaked slightly. Now it is up to your twitch/reaction time to get the job
      done right, as opposed to being able to simply watch the govenor's daughter's hand motions and body language.

      The second tweak is the addition of being able to physically hunt for treasure. In the previous versions, you
      would find a map, sail to the right spot and land. If you had the location right, you would have your booty. Not
      so in this version. Now you take four of your crewman ashore and have to find the red "X". All while avoiding
      booby-traps and vicious jaguars. If you lose your crew, it's back to the ship. If you make it to the "X", then it
      is time to start raking in the doubloons.

      The third change has been made to the sneaking segments. If you want to sneak into a port, it is handled in the
      exact same way; creeping through the streets, slipping past guards, hiding behind fences and so on. However, your
      character now moves in a grid, as opposed to being able to move a bit more freely. This does not change the
      gameplay, but it is possible to accidentally step into a guard's line of sight because you cannot stop moving
      forward until your character reached the middle of the next tile.

      Next to the original game content, the PSP version adds bonus treasure missions, with more plunder and new
      locations. The game has been tweaked for widescreen display. Multiplayer is supported for up to 4 players, through
      Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc.</story>

    <story>The PSP release of Silverfall is a port of the initial PC release from 2007, with various adaptations to make
      it more suitable for the platform.

      The player chooses one of 4 races (human, elf, troll, goblin) before starting his journey. The game remains - as
      in the initial version - a hack-and-slash RPG with a top-down view, with quests and dialogue with NPCs. The
      player's quest of saving the realm of Nelwë from the spreading evil also involves taking sides with either the
      adepts of technology, or those of nature.

      The first visible difference from the PC release is the visual style. The cel shading has been abandoned while the
      textures and polygonal models have been downgraded. The game now has a more colourful palette.

      A difference concerning the game mechanic is the absence of companions. The development team's reasoning for this
      is the console's less resources available. As a compensation though, the number of enemies on screen has been
      increased.

      The last notable difference with the PC release is that the open world environment has turned into a succession of
      levels. The reason for this is to adapt the game to the portable style of the console, as the developers had in
      mind play sessions of ten minutes, although this doesn't affect the c:a 20 hours duration of the campaign.</story>

    <story>Tactical Strike is the third hand-held game in the long-line of the SOCOM series. This one differs from its
      console cousins. Not only can the player choose to control a squad of US Navy Seals, but the player can
      alternatively decide to control one of several foreign units that have roles comparable to the SEALS, such as the
      Dutch KCT, German KSK, Australian SASR, the Italian 9th Parachute Assault Regiment, the Spanish UOE, the British
      SAS, the French GIGN or the South Korean 707th Special Mission Unit.

      The story takes place in Panama, as the players national ambassador and the Panamanian ambassador are seized by a
      local group of rebel narcotrafficante kidnappers, referred to as "La Mano Los Gente" -- though it is worth noting
      that this is egregiously ungrammatical Spanish, since it would translate literally as "The Hand The People,"
      because the "de" is missing! The fictional group of criminals, with their comical name, hold the pair for ransom
      and it is up to the player to conduct an increasingly complex and difficult operation in order to rescue the two
      diplomats.

      The gameplay is different from other SOCOM games, in that there remains a squad of four men to control, but
      instead of bringing up a menu interface and then pointing the cursor to a certain location to give an order, this
      new game features a locator box that is moved along the surface of the ground. This lets the player choose a
      specific target location or rally point as the case may be, and then to use a certain button to instruct soldiers
      to take cover, establish crossfire, defend, ambush, etc. One can, of course, order them to use particular weapons
      such as close combat knives, rifles, satchel charges for demolition, pistols, a shot fired by the squad's sniper,
      or thrown grenades. When choosing an aimpoint to throw a grenade, a dynamically adjustable moving arc appears, to
      show what trajectory it will follow.

      There are nine different non-linear missions to play, with the option of two instant action missions for each
      stage, and the story is told with pre-rendered cut-scenes.</story>

      Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978
      classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync
      with the onscreen action.

      Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming
      fleet of invaders before they reach the ground. The main objective is to get as many points as possible before
      running out of lives.

      Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right
      descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player
      to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

      Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other. The Nintendo
      DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</story>

      Spider-Man free reign to explore New York City, and doing everyday tasks from stopping muggers, bank robberies and
      car-jackers, to delivering pizzas and snapping photos for the Daily Bugle.

      However, the action becomes even more intense as not only does Spidey have to keep the streets safe in general for
      the citizens of Manhattan, he also has to face up against such super villains as Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio and
      Calypso, as well as a few entanglements with the Black Cat along the way to square off against Dr. Octopus and

    <story>Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes bridges the gap between season one and two of the animated TV
      series. In the game the player learns more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunts down the all-new
      Skakoan super villain Kul Teska in a gameplay style very similar to Lego Star Wars.

      The game is fully built around drop in/drop out-coop for two players. This means each mission in this
      3rd-person-action-adventure features two famous characters from the TV series including Obi-Wan Kenobi, the
      padawan Ahsoka and Captain Rex but separated by class. The players either control commandos or Jedi characters -
      never both mixed as they have totally different abilities and limitations. If no second player is available, the
      AI will automatically take over the second character and help overcome the many obstacles waiting ahead - mostly
      in form of several different kinds of separatist droids. While the players can use their lightsaber or blaster to
      fend them off, the Jedi characters also have the ability to ride the droids by jumping onto them from behind. This
      is not only useful to blast through enemy lines but is also used to solve specific riddles preventing the
      characters from moving on. In addition the droids can be forced to dance with every other droid on the screen
      following his lead making them defenseless. These dances are unique for each droid and need to be bought first in
      the shop. Also available there: funny masks and combat upgrades like stronger blasters or a more powerful
      force-push.

      To buy these things, the players have to unlock them first and then need to invest points which are gained by
      killing enemies as well as by successfully completing missions or the mini-games. These mini-games are scattered
      around the levels and turn up once a specific section has been completed. They mostly involve killing as many
      enemies as possible in a short amount of time. Each kill in succession both during normal gameplay and the
      mini-games also ranks up the multiplier adding even more points to the account. Once a player dies, he will
      respawn at the nearest checkpoint either immediately if he plays alone or after the second player has reached one
      - both times without any penalties.</story>

    <story>Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron is a third-person shooter video game, part of the Star Wars:
      Battlefront series released November 3, 2009 on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.

      Gameplay
      Elite Squadron allows players to participate in combat on foot, in ground vehicles or in space. Players are also
      able to enter capital ships and, once the shields are down, fight the enemy inside on foot. The ground-space
      transitions are accompanied by short cutscenes while the game loads the next area. The same is also true of
      entering or exiting a capital ship. This is the first Battlefront game to allow players to fly from ground to
      space battles. The consequences of each battle will depend on the players actions, meaning that each individual
      enemy killed can affect the outcome of a result. The battlefront will not be one giant, seamless map, but a
      compilation of inter-connected, smaller size areas, each one capable of affecting the other.

      Elite Squadron features "Heroes and Villains" gameplay.
      It includes playable characters such as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Darth Vader, Darth Maul, The Emperor and Kit
      Fisto, and the Heroes and Villains mode (Assault Mode) last featured in Star Wars: Battlefront II. Pre-release
      screenshots also show that General Rahm Kota, a character from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is playable, as well
      as other characters from Renegade Squadron, such as Col Serra. The Heroes and Villains mode is displayed quite
      conveniently after a demo had been released on the PlayStation Network. Other game modes have been implied, with a
      focus on multiplayer, such as a deathmatch mode. Also, the Galactic Conquest mode, has undergone an enhancement on
      the PSP. In Galactic Conquest, two players are able to share a single PSP, and compete against each other in a
      strategy based game mode. PSP Players are able to mix elements from the Star Wars saga and put them into locations
      and situations that never happened, allowing for full customization. The story mode has been called "a huge step
      up from previous story modes", and was praised for incorporating the controls into the mission. It was also
      revealed that making progress in the story, and completing objectives, was the way to unlock customization props.

      can play a free battle against the computer or a friend via local wireless play.

      The game system is relatively simple; characters have a limited set of moves, but they can be customized per
      character. Each character can also be upgraded using orbs earned in quest mode to buy new moves. In addition to
      regular moves, each character also has special super moves, which require use of a special bar which fills as the
      player lands blows. The player also unlocks assist characters as the game is played, which can be assigned to
      characters to give special assist moves.

      There is also a database mode where the player can read introductions for each of the playable and assist
      characters. The full list of featured series are as follows.

    <story>Our four heroes from Super Monkey Ball - Aiai, Meemee, Baby and Gongon - were enjoying a typical day, when
      they saw a flying machine crash down on a nearby island. Soon, they discovered that the mysterious Naysayers have
      appeared, spreading discord and unhappiness all over the island. And to top it all off, the prince and princess of
      the neighboring islands have gone missing on Jungle Island - if they aren't found and returned, there's sure to be
      trouble! Can our heroes restore order to Monearth?

      Super Monkey Ball Adventure takes the monkey rolling madness of the previous games and puts a story-based spin on
      it. Choosing from one of the four monkeys, Players roll their way around the various islands of Monearth, talking
      to citizens and performing the tasks they request (such as delivering sandwiches, finding a missing baby, rescuing
      rare flowers, and more) to cheer them up.

      Certain parts of the island are locked by 'Puzzle Gates' - these can only be unlocked by solving the puzzle stages
      which can be accessed in front of the gate. Each pad transports you to a different Puzzle Realm. The Puzzle Realm
      stages are the more familiar gameplay of Super Monkey Ball - simple looking stages where players must carefully
      (but quickly) roll their monkey to the finish line within the time limit.

      Bananas can also be collected throughout the game - these are used as currency, and can be used to unlock new
      playable characters and puzzle stages. They can also be given to particular unhappy citizens. The monkeys will
      also learn magical chants as they progress through the game - these allow you to climb walls, set your monkey's
      ball on fire, use a boxing glove to attack, and more.

      Also included in Super Monkey Ball Adventure are the famous Party Games - favorites like Monkey Race, Monkey
      Target and Monkey fight return. There's also three new games: 'Monkey Cannon' - fire monkeys at enemy towers to
      steal their bricks for your own tower. 'Monkey Bounce' - bounce on a trampoline-like platform with your opponents,
      and try to claim as many squares as possible. 'Monkey Tag' - roll around a globe and try to collect as many

    <story>Tenchu: Time of the Assassins is a stealth-action game that is part of the Tenchu series. The plot is set in
      feudal age Japan, and revolves around a group of ninjas and assassins who get involved into the kidnapping of Lord
      Gohda's single daughter, Princess Kiku. The game's protagonists are Rikkimaru and Ayame (both ninjas of the Azuma
      clan, working for Lord Gohda), Rin (a renegade ninja of the Beniya clan), and Tesshu (a medical doctor who works
      as a hired assassin at night). All four characters' campaigns can be selected right from the start. Each
      character's campaign encompasses eight missions.

      The gameplay is once again based on the stealth-action genre's fundamental premise of completing the mission goals
      with being discovered as few times as possible, since the player characters are hopelessly outnumbered by the
      enemy guards. When the player approaches an unsuspecting enemy from behind, he can perform a stealth kill, which
      kills the target instantly without risking a fight.

      Mission objectives vary from getting to a certain location on the map, taking out a certain target, to escorting
      NPCs to a designated area. A distance sensor indicates how great the distance is between the player and the
      closest enemy, but not the direction in which the enemy is. It also shows whether the enemy is aware of the
      players presence. As usual for the series, the player is free choose between several weapons and gadgets, which he
      obtains as reward for completing mission. The better the ranking he receives after the missions, the more and
      better items he receives.

      Gadgets include throwing knifes, poisonous rice, healing potions, smoke bombs, grenades and many more. Aside from
      these optional accessories the player always has a trusty grappling hook at his disposal, which can be used to
      climb houses and ledges.

      The game also features a mission editor to create story-driven single player missions, as well as multiplayer
      missions. The multiplayer mode can be played competitively and cooperatively with 2 players.</story>

    <story>Test Drive Unlimited lets the player choose one of several characters, both male and female, waiting at an
      airport to check in for their flight to the Caribbean dream island O'ahu located in Hawaii. The characters do not
      have different statistics, that only applies to the extravagant, licensed cars.

      The whole island is accessible from the beginning and after the player has bought his first home and car, he can
      either drive around and look for events or load up the map and jump directly to a location of a race, a car
      salesman or other locations - similar to Need for Speed Underground. Every bought car has a built-in navigation
      system, guided by a woman's voice to get the player to his destination, either pre-programmed in the game or
      decided by the player.

      There are over 125 different cars and motorcycles in different price ranges to choose from. From the Audi TT over
      the Jaguar XJ200 to the McLaren F1 and Kawasaki Z1000, there is everything the character needs as a young man or
      girl with too much money on their hands. Each car has its own, realistic set of characteristics such as speed or
      handling, but they all have a highly detailed exterior and interior in common.

      The character starts with $200.000 dollars in his pocket, but there will not be anything left after buying a first
      car and home. Additional cash needs to be earned in different kinds of races from checkpoint challenges to time
      trials. The money cannot only be used to buy new homes and new cars (and a little tuning for those), but also to
      buy new outfits for the avatar.

      The heart of Test Drive Unlimited is the online mode. Using a GameSpy account, players connect to the official TDU
      server immediately after loading the game. New options become available online, such as a meeting lounge where the
      statistics and looks of other players can be looked up. It also provides access to player-created matches shown on
      the map screen. Creating a race here also works in the singleplayer modes. At any location, the start and finish
      can be defined, as well as the type of the race, which type/classes of cars or bikes are allowed and how many
      people can participate. If not all slots have been filled up by other players, the AI will take control of the
      rest.

      The PSP and PS2 versions have a lower visual quality and lack a few features, such as manual transmission, avatar
      customization, certain cars and all motorcycles, dealership and tuning shop NPCs, the vehicle interior camera
      angle and certain missions. They do include Master Points and Auto GPS, and certain default vehicles only
      available for the 360 version through download packs.</story>

      five themeparks, you will have to complete various tasks represented through an in-game menu split into six
      categories, such as building coaster rides, hiring publicity and looking at the visitors needs. The game features
      a robust sim-like economy within the park, where the player has to manage prices, fund the research for new rides
      and make sure there is enough power to around for all the stalls and rides. The rollercoaster editor is similar to
      that of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series, but all coasters have to start in assigned areas. Progression is made by
      completing missions that either requires you to build themepark rides, befriend visitors, root out robot invaders,
      bribe journalists, train personale and play lots &amp; lots of minigames. As each collectable found and mission
      completed, the player gains experience, called Thrill Points that will allow him to increase in level, and open
      new themeparks to buy and build up as he pleases. In addition to the single-player there is a separate multiplayer
      mini-game section, as well as Main Menu section dedicated to coasters that can be created and saved to be used in
      the game.

      There is over fourty minigames to be played in this version of Thrillville, and Off the Rails adds the ability for
      rollercoasters to crash, adding more minigames, more options and expands the interaction between the player and
      the visitors.</story>

    <story>This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts' Tiger Woods PGA Tour
      franchise. Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has
      a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved
      GameFace character creation.

      Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal
      Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to generate digital
      doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and
      mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where
      you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields
      more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with
      different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball
      has been struck without watching where the ball lands.

      PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to
      go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game.
      The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.</story>

    <story>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 is a simulation of the golf sport. In comparison to the 08 version the game is
      missing several playing modes, including the online multiplayer. Left are the usual PGA Tour career mode and the
      EA Sports Cup. The latter consists of short courses with three holes.

      With successful tournaments and accomplishments the player receives experience and skill points which are used to
      improve the character's abilities. The player can choose between two click and the True Swing controls: in the
      former the player needs to click two respectively three times in the right timing to set the hit conditions and in
      the latter the player simulates the hit movement with the analog stick. There are overall 27 licensed players and
      20 courses.</story>

      Chances to rank up come in various different ways now. There are spray painted lines located throughout the city

      while doing a manual for a certain time and distance, point combos, and trick combos. Also players can obtain
      missions via random strangers located throughout the city.

      Players can also earn Stokens by performing tricks to impress the locals that can be found wandering around the
      city. Players can use these Stokens to buy additional clothing, haircut styles, shoes, tricks, and boards from the
      store.

      New to this game is the slow motion "Nail the Trick" mode where the focus is placed on the skater's feet and the
      movement of the board can be controlled with both of the analog sticks to build up a huge combo score!

      The PSP version includes 14 multiplayer modes and 8 classic levels including Hawaii, Alcatraz and The Mall. The

    <story>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the
      defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the
      Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again
      all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.

      The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the
      movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow
      for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side
      include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new
      character), and Megatron.

      Though the game doesnâ€™t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as
      special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly
      through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the
      player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards
      as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.

      For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a "Remote Weapon System",
      which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.</story>

    <story>This game is a plaformer with a twist: you play a girl in an aquatic world, and the only way to fight against
      your enemies are your brain and a grappling hook, which you have to master if you plan on finishing this game.
      Because there are no power-ups.

      Your enemies are all sea creatures, but some of them have grown legs and now they can attack and chase you on
      land.

      One of the exceptional things about this game is its replay value, absent in most platformers: you can finish the
      game and then play against your best time, try to find hidden paths or exits, or even record your best replays on
      the memory card.

      This edition is a re-release of the original Umihara Kawase: Shun, also for the Sony PlayStation, released back in
      1997. In terms of new content, new levels have been added, as well as several bugfixes, but it is essentially the
      same game as the first edition.</story>

    <story>Set in the middle ages, Undead Knights is a story about a puppet king, his mysterious queen, and a murderous
      betrayal. The king ordered his men to slay the entire family of his loyal knight, Romulus, after Romulus questions
      the loyalty of the queen.

      You play as one of three characters; the Knight Romulus, his younger brother Remus, or Sylvia, Remus' bride and
      daughter to the king. As the three lay dying, they make a pact with an evil force, and return infused with unholy
      power, bent on revenge.

      As they make their way to the king, players must convert foes into zombie slaves. These zombies may be ordered to
      attack or pin down your opponents, break down barrier/objects, and even form unliving bridges to circumvent
      obstacles. Zombie minions may also be utilized as inhuman shields, objects to be thrown, and more.

      The game features a metal soundtrack, third person viewpoint, and gameplay similar to that of Tecmo's 3D Ninja
      Gaiden games. Players will collect "Dark Energy" along the way, which can be spent on character upgrades. In
      addition to the single player story mode, Undead Knights has ad-hoc multiplayer support for up to four players.

      While former officers from the Orochi army banded together to form their own armies, a mysterious group appeared
      to bring Orochi back from the netherworld.
      Picking up from where Warriors Orochi left off, this game pits the warriors of Wu, Shu, Wei and the Samurai
      against these foes and their armies.

      This game features similar gameplay to the other games in the Warriors series, like unlockable characters,
      upgradable weapons and multiple stages to play through.
      Also seeing a return is the team mate system from the previous Orochi game, which allows you to rotate between
      three different warriors.
      Choose these three warriors from over 90 playable characters, and use them to battle with as you strive to defeat
      the vast armies of your opponents.

      New features in this version include Dream Mode, which tells even more of Orochi's story then the last game, and
      new unlockable characters and weapons not seen before in the series.</story>

    <story>Based on the 1979 Paramount Pictures film of the same name and voiced by most of the original cast, The
      Warriors follows the career of a Coney Island street gang. Starting months before the events of the film, The
      Warriors expand and defend their Coney Island turf, while proving that they are heavy enough players to join The
      Riffs’ network. With a citywide rep, they can get invited to a major gang meeting where the future of New York
      street crime will be decided.

      The game follows the nine lead members of The Warriors (with flashback missions showing how they came to The
      Warriors): leader Cleon, Swan, Ajax, Cowboy, Cochise, Snow, Fox, Rembrandt, and Vermin. During the game, the
      player will control each member, usually acting as a war chief and leading a squad of Warriors on a mission.
      Missions vary from simply wrecking another crew to completing a series of objectives while avoiding arrest or
      worse.

      During missions, players can mug pedestrians, steal car radios, commit smash and grabs, tag walls or bomb other
      gangs’ burners, and load up on flash. Between each story based mission, The Warriors return to their Coney Island
      hangout where they can train to improve their stats, go out on patrol, review their accomplishments, replay
      levels, or enter into a series of quick-play combat matches.

      The game plays like a squad-based brawler. Each Warrior has his own fighting style and much of the game
      environment can be weaponized. Fights are fast and often brutal, but stealth is also an option. Players can
      perform stealthy finishing moves and distract police or other gang members with thrown bottles. The game’s
      environments are fully 3D allowing Warriors to escape along the rooftops, hop over fences, or dash into shadowy
      areas.</story>

    <story>Become the God of Destruction! Build a thriving natural ecosystem, a twisting, tunneling dungeon underneath
      the earth, and fill it with hordes of terrible monsters to protect the evil overlord, Badman. Ensure that he is
      safe from armies of nasty humans, eager to ransack the place, steal your loot, and prevent Badman from taking over
      the world!

      Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman! is a strategy game in the vein of the Bullfrog game, Dungeon Keeper. Players use
      their pickaxe to dig deep into the earth to protect the villain, Badman, from harm. Their goal is to create
      monsters by digging up nutrient-filled blocks, which produce monsters. The more nutrients inside the block, the
      more powerful the monster is. By creating all sorts of powerful monsters, you'll increase your 'Battle Power',
      which indicates how powerful Badman's entire army is.

      Players only have a limited amount of 'Dig Power' available. After this runs out, they cannot dig through the
      earth any more, and must rely on the monsters to take care of the dungeon. More Dig Power can be earned for each
      level by not using all the Dig Power you were given, or by earning bonus Dig Power at the end of the level.

    <story>WipEout Pulse is the second game in the WipEout series to be released on the PSP. Just like the other titles
      in the series, it is a futuristic racing games where players control a hovercraft-like vehicle that hovers above
      the ground and can reach very high speeds. The game is set in 2207 where players take part in the FX400
      Anti-Gravity Racing League with courses all over the world.

      The vehicles are divided over different teams (twelve including downloads), each with their own characteristics
      based on handling, speed, acceleration and more. While racing, moving over pads provides boosts or both offensive
      and defensive power-ups such as shields, rockets, a wall of fire, autopilot, a gun or a turbo boost. Instead of
      using weapons, they can now also be absorbed to restore the energy levels. A single button is used to accelerate,
      with regular steering and also air brakes for sharp corners. The visuals are very fast and the soundtrack consists
      of mostly electronic tracks, a hallmark of the series.

      The base game consists of twelve tracks, but these can be driven in both directions (designated by black or white
      in the title name). New to the track design are waterfall-like drops, loops and corkscrews. At certain section the
      vehicle is glued to the track to pass these. Entirely new to the series is the revamped progression system. As
      usual, new tracks and faster models need to be unlocked by winning races, but instead of a linear model these are
      now grouped as hexagon-clustered grids with different modes of play. When available, players can choose any of the
      sections to participate in a time trial, single race, head-to-head, eliminator games (returning from Wipeout 3)
      and Zone games (introduced in WipEout Fusion) where the vehicle constantly accelerates and transforms into faster
      models until all health is depleted. A certain amount of races need to be won to access a new grid, but using this
      system some difficult races can be avoided or ignored. In all races the vehicles are destroyed when all energy is
      depleted. Based on the performance a bronze, silver or gold medal is awarded and there are three difficulty
      settings.

      Using the vehicle of a certain team regularly is awarded with a loyalty system. The game supports game sharing and
      multiplayer modes using both Ad Hoc and Infrastructure as access. Up to 30 mp3 files can be loaded on a memory
      stick to use as the in-game soundtrack, there is photo mode to take screenshots during replays and on the game's
      official website players can design their own car skins using a flash client to use in the game. As with the
      previous games, there are many expansion packs that introduce new teams and tracks.</story>

      tracks, vying for first place in one of many tournaments. There are ten anti-gravity vehicles available to use
      (two need to be unlocked), each with their own characteristics in speed, handling and acceleration. Vehicles are
      further divided into classes that are unlocked gradually. In later classes most of the vehicles become much faster
      and require more precise steering at fast speeds. In the same vein, players can unlock new tournaments.

      There are a total of sixteen tracks to race on: twelve designed from the ground up for the PSP, as well as four
      classic Wipeout tracks. Each track has its own obstacles, as well as weapon pick-ups (both offensive and
      defensive) and speed boosters. The different game modes include single races, tournaments of sets of races, time
      trial and zone races. In the zone races the player goes through a number of increasingly difficult zones on his
      own without the ability to slow down until the vehicle explodes because of collision damage. New game elements are
      unlocked through the Tournament mode.

      The game features wireless play over ad-hoc mode (PSP-to-PSP). It was also the first PSP game to support
      downloadable content with extra teams, tracks and PSP skins. Some of these packs are only available for specific
      regional versions. The European version of the game supports game sharing.</story>

      available on Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.

      In Worms: Open Warfare, the player takes control of an army of worms. The goal of the game is to defeat the
      opposing army through reducing the health points of enemy worms using various types of weaponry while avoiding
      friendly fire and other obstacles. The weapons and gadgets you use in battle include grenades, homing missiles,
      bazookas, cluster bombs, banana bombs (a Worms staple), dynamite, air strikes, shotguns, and many more. You can
      also choose from a variety of settings to battle in and make your own schemes and teams.
      The game is played in rounds with each worm starting with 100 hit points. Each team takes turns controlling one of
      their worms. The player is usually allocated 60 seconds per turn to move their worm around the battlefield and
      attack the opponent worms, though this time limit is customisable when playing non-career games. Only one attack
      is allowed per turn.
      In addition to timing individual player turns, each round has a 20-minute time limit. If the round timer runs down
      to 0:00 before a team claims victory, every worm's HP drops to 1, creating a sudden death scenario. During the
      course of a round, crates containing health or weapons will occasionally drop and the water level will rise.

    <story>Worms: Open Warfare 2 is an artillery and strategy video game and the ninth installment in the Worms series.
      It was developed by Team17 and Two Tribes, and published by THQ for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS in
      2007. It is the sequel to Worms: Open Warfare.

      The gameplay of Open Warfare 2 is similar to that of previous games in the series. The game is viewed from a
      side-scrolling perspective. The player takes control of a team of several worms, and is pitted against other teams
      of worms under the control of AI (if in Singleplayer) or another Human (if in Multiplayer). Actions are performed
      in time-limited turns that cycle through each team. The winning team is that which can kill the opposing teams'
      worms; this can be achieved by using various types of weaponry and tools, availability of which depends on the
      game mode being played. Battles takes place on randomized, destructible terrain, which are visually distinguished
      by themes; "Forts" mode takes place on two forts, whose terrain depends on the theme. The player is able to select
      victory dances and color schemes for their worms, and to make custom race courses or fort maps using the level
      editor.

      The PSP version allows players to select hats for their worms, while the DS version includes some exclusive
      minigames via the "Laboratory" mode. A demo of the game has been released by download for the PlayStation
      Portable, and for the Nintendo DS via DS Download Station Vol. 7.</story>

    <story>FIA licensed World Rally Championship game including the 2005 season teams, drivers, cars, and rally
      locations. The player controls the car on the track and tries to complete the stages in fastest possible time.
      Since rally is driven so that the track is clear of other cars, competitors are shown as ghost cars. Co-drivers
      notes are both spoken and shown on the screen to aid in navigating the often twisty stages.

      Game can be played in Quick Rally, Time Trial, Single Rally, Championship, and Multiplayer modes. Quick Rally
      selects a random car and rally stage to race. In Time Trial, a ghost car is shown on the track and the player's
      goal is to beat its time on that stage. In Single Rally mode, player chooses the team and car to drive with and
      needs to complete all the stages in a single rally. Other drivers are shown as ghost cars.

      Championship mode extends the Single Rally mode into full season of 16 rallies. Each rally has two to four stages
      and the player must reach certain position in order to advance to the next stage. Difficulty level (novice,
      professional, expert, extreme) defines the number of stages per rally and the required finishing position. Expert
      and extreme levels are unlocked by completing the preceding level. After each rally, points are awarded to top 8
      drivers and the championship is won by most points at the end of the season. Completing championship modes also
      unlocks new car types and rally stages for other play modes.

      Multiplayer modes include both offline (hot-seat) and online play. The hot-seat rallies are for up to four players
      and allow the players to compete in Time Trial, Single Rally, and Championship modes. Online wireless play allows
      up to eight players to race together on a single stage. As in other modes, competitors are shown as ghost cars.

      The game has an arcade-style control scheme (no manual gear changes for example) and a simple damage model.
      Damaging the car has visual impact on the car and on expert and extreme levels, damage affects the car performance
      too. PSP WRC supports downloadable content, like custom avatars for the player.</story>

    <story>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse is an action role-playing game developed primarily by Raven Software and
      published by Activision. It is the follow up to 2004's X-Men Legends. It was first released in September 2005 for
      the GameCube, Microsoft Windows, N-Gage, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Xbox video game platforms. It is
      set after the events of X-Men Legends and features the mutant supervillain Apocalypse as the primary antagonist.

      The developers intended the game to have a greater sense of scale than its predecessor, and writers created a
      story where the villains known as the Brotherhood of Mutants would need to ally themselves with the heroic X-Men
      to defeat a greater threat. High quality cinematics were created by Blur Studio. Online multiplayer was also
      added.

      The game was well received by gaming critics on all platforms. Critics felt that the inclusion of online play,
      additional mutant powers, and a larger cast made the game an improvement over its predecessor. Some reviewers were
      critical of the game's voice acting and felt that the gameplay was repetitive. It sold enough copies to be added
      to the budget line known as PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits.</story>

      where you play as the four main characters of the show (Kimiko, Omi, Raimundo and Clay). Even if you play alone
      (the game supports 4 simultaneous players in story mode), the other 3 are present, controlled by the computer. You
      can also unlock 2 additional characters: Jack Spicer and Chase Young.

      The players must defeat waves of enemy robots to collect Shen Gong Wu artifacts to increase their power and defeat
      series of enemies, until they are able to face Mala Mala Jong and put an end on the plans of the evil boy genius,
      Jack Spicer. Each Shen Gong Wu provides a new power, like locking nearby characters or punching the ground for
      area damage. Additional Shen Gong Wu can be bought using coins collected during the game.

      The gameplay is inspired by party fighting games, like Power Stone and Super Smash Bros. You can chain combos with
      button combinations, jump and give flying kicks.

      Between the game levels, there are showdowns, where the characters have to bet a Shen Gong Wu. The one that wins
      the challenge chooses a Shen Gong Wu from the player who lost. You can also only play the showdowns, instead the

    <story>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force is a card game, following the TCG rules (OCG in Japan) and based on the first season
      of the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime series. The player controls a young boy who enrolls at a foreign student at the Duel
      Academy.

      The game is divided in three parts. In the first one the player has to team up with one of the famous characters
      from the anime. There are different conversation options and each Sunday a Tag Duel is held with one of the chosen
      partners. Affection needs to be built up through conversations and gifts until a partner has six hearts.
      Eventually the Tag Force Tournament at the end of July needs to be won and that is where the second part starts. A
      final partner is chosen and the characters much progress through duels to acquire 90 GX Medals and make it to the
      final round of the tournament. In the third part all Shadow Riders (Steven Stars in Japan) must be defeated that
      have brainwashed other characters.

      The protagonist starts with a water deck and gains cards, which can be purchased from the store with DPs, as time
      goes by. After completing the game it an be restarted with another character to gain DPs. The duels are played
      from an almost top-down view with turn-based card desk battles.</story>

    <story>Zendoku takes the concept of the puzzle game Sudoku and adds role playing elements to it.

      The game replaces the numbers 1 to 9 with nine Martial Arts symbols like a panda or a dragon but the original
      rules remain in place. This means the player still needs to complete a column, row or 3x3 box were every symbol is
      only used once. The player can test his skills either in Classic Sudoku or in Zen-Mode where he needs to solve
      Sudoku puzzles under the pressure of time, but the core of the game is the Quest-Mode.

      At the beginning of the quest the player chooses from eight available characters. Four fight with weapons, four
      freehand but each one has a different quest, uses different fighting styles and has a different lucky symbol.
      Kingkage is for example a typical ninja. He uses the Ninjutsu-style, wants to be a legendary fighter and has the
      panda as his lucky symbol. Once a decision has been made. the player follows the story line of the chosen
      character on a 2D world map and when a fight occurs, the opponents play a round of Sudoku.

      Every time one of the fighters completes a column, row or 3x3 box an attack is launched and obstacles appear on
      the opponents board while an attack icon travels along a rail towards the attacked. If he now correctly places his
      lucky symbol on the board, the attack will be reversed back his opponent. Placing a symbol incorrectly will make
      the player lose health and causes several cells on the opponent's grid to automatically fill in.

      The game also features a multiplayer mode for two player in which they can either try to solve a puzzle together
      or play against each other in a battle.</story>
