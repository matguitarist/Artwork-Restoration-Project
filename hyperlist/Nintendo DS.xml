      set between Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations and Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney.
      This game is a standard "point and click" adventure, with the player controlling Edgeworth's movements and what he
      interacts with. For each case, the goal is to collect evidence to determine who the perpetrator is, how the crime
      was committed and their motive. This is presented as a combination of a third-person view showing the characters
      at the crime scene and through animated close-up images of the characters, annotated by text dialog. In some
      cases, still images are used to highlight dramatic scenes.</story>

    <story>Based on the novel by Akagawa Jirou, the story puts you in a role of a high-school teacher who due to a
      painful breakup leaves his old workplace and comes to a far away place to start a new job at Bell Garden school.
      While taking a stroll, a woman's scream is heard... you run to see what is happening, and the mystery begins. You
      can select main character to be a man or a woman, which slightly influences the game scenario (when the player is
      a man, his partner will be a woman and vice-versa).

      Game progress advances as a mystery novel. As the case becomes obvious you will investigate and use deductive
      skills to find out the culprit and the motive behind the crime. During the gameplay you can visit various places
      and check the map of the Bell Garden school and its surroundings. During investigation and story progress, you
      will use a character correlation diagram to connect a certain person with the matter at hand. Also, the diagram
      can be used to make relations between characters (for example to mark them as lovers). Story can have more
      endings, depending on the player's deduction and skills to solve the case. After a solved case, if available, a
      new scenario will open.</story>

    <story>After arriving at the Animal Village, you try desperately to fit in and make friends. After almost
      succeeding, a boxing gym opens and all the animals join up. Looks like you'll have to take part, too. Get ready to
      box!

      Animal Boxing is a game that requires you to hold the Nintendo DS upside down to play. The player uses the touch
      screen to punch in a variety of ways - tapping your opponent throws a standard punch, swiping horizontally throws
      a hook, and swiping upwards throws an uppercut. By holding the stylus on-screen longer, you can charge power for a
      more powerful punch. The Control Pad is used to dodge left and right, as well as block.

      As your boxer takes and delivers hits, their Anger Meter increases. When it is at its maximum, your boxer fills
      with rage, and all of their attacks become more powerful for a limited time. This can be used to turn the tide in
      a match. However, opponents can also use this tactic, meaning that blocking and dodging become very important
      during these moments!

      As with other boxing games, your goal is to defeat your opponents in a series of bouts to win the championship
      belts. Once you defeat the champion, you'll win the belt and progress to the next championship. Each championship
      you win unlocks new animals to fight against in the Vs. Animal matches, as well as new items to decorate your
      boxer with.</story>

      Wild World focuses on living in a remote village populated with anthropomorphic animals, where the player is
      encouraged to perform any number of tasks, such as collecting and planting. Like all Animal Crossing titles, the
      game is synced to the console's clock and calendar, allowing the game to be played in real-time, which affects the
      occurrence of in-game events based on the current time of day or season. Wild World also utilizes Nintendo Wi-Fi
      Connection, which notably allows players to travel and visit the villages of other players via online play.

    <story>Aquarium by DS is a fish tank simulation in which the player can choose from 30 different underwater animals.
      Additionally, the player can customize their tank in size and add different backgrounds and accessories like
      plants, rocks or even buildings like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. New fish types can be unlocked by taking good care
      of the aquariums residents.

      And that's the aim of the game, taking care of the fish in the tank. They need to be fed, the tank has to be
      cleaned and water temp and salinity have to be adjusted to create a perfect environment. A wrong environment or an
      unsuitable mix of animals in the tank will result in the death of the players pets. Instead of swimming dead at
      the surface or bloody death animations they simply disappear from the screen. Not playing the game for a few days
      and therefore not feeding, will result in a deadly surprise, too.

      Using the Wi-Fi-feature of the DS the player can swap fishes with other players.</story>

    <story>Arctic Tale is based on the National Geography documentary of the same name. Players control a polar bear
      (both cub and adult) trying to survive in a harsh climate of snowy landscapes. There are eleven stages where the
      little bear explores the environment, searches for foods and collects paw prints that unlock pictures in a photo
      gallery and additional chapters. Later, two other animals can be controlled as well: a walrus that is also able to
      explore underwater environment, the fast Arctic fox able to hunt down rabbits and an orca whale.

      The levels consist of free-roaming environments, on land or underwater, where the animals need to gather food to
      avoid having the heart icon fade away. While playing 16 different mini-games can be accessed where the player can
      earn bronze, silver and golds awards to unlock additional chapters. These games include Ice Slide (obstacle

    <story>The latest version of Taito's classic game: Arkanoid.
      It features the classic gameplay of the previous games, the player controls the Spaceship VAUS (a moving platform
      at the base of the lower screen) and its energy ball to destroy the color block (in the upper screen) through each
      levels.
      As usual, there are various power-ups to help through the game (laser, slow ball, duplicate balls, next level,
      etc.)

      The game has one player mode, multiplayer and vs COM modes.

      The one player mode consists of the Clear mode and the Quest mode.

      The Clear mode is a series of 7 zones of 5 rounds each. There is a total of 28 zones in the game. At the end of
      the Clear modes, Ananke (the main character and pilot of the VAUS) frees one of his captured friends, these
      friend's VAUS can then be used in the game.

      In the Quest mode, each previously played round is available to replay with a specific challenge (Break all blocks
      of one color within time limit, or ball launch limit, etc.) Each round gives points that can be used at the shop
      to buy in-game features to customize it (Blocks shapes, VAUS, backgrounds, etc.)

      The VS Com and Multiplayer are similar. You must defeat either the Com or another friend in either Bust All or
      Bust Color match. The quickest to achieve the goal wins. There is also new power-ups that hinder the opponent.

      in a few cases blowing into the microphone. Challenges range from actual Olympic sports like disc throwing to

    <story>Avalon Code is a hack and slash Action-RPG that takes place in a world about to end. Choosing between a male
      or female avatar, the player is given the Book of Prophecy from which the world will be remade. Everything in the
      world can be scanned and recorded into the Book of Prophecy, and players can further redefine an entry's
      properties by mixing and matching pieces of code.

      Codes in Avalon Code are Tetris-like chunks which fit into each book entry's grid of available code space. Think
      of these codes like genes in a DNA sequence that you can grab and move with the stylus. For example, elemental
      properties (such as fire) can be incorporated into a weapon, allowing you to melt ice. Removing codes from enemies
      allows you to weaken them, making them easier to dispatch.

      Players string together light combos and can perform charged special moves. Additionally, the player can begin a
      Judgment Link which juggles the enemy higher and higher (with proper timing) which yields precious HP, MP and Gem
      bonuses. Dungeons are somewhat unique in that each room is a timed challenge, with requirements such as hitting
      all switches, defeating all enemies, Judgment Linking xN, and/or various combinations of these.</story>

      that lives as a pig and turns the players' flat into a beauty salon. To make sure customers are satisfied, players
      have to use their gaming skills. Salon owners use the Nintendo DS-Touchpen to click on stars to perfect their
      customers' make-up, copy designs for body painting or give the best possible massage by drawing the right sequence
      of lines onscreen in the required time. The end of each chapter presents an even bigger challenge, featuring a
      client with special individual requests, such as an elderly lady who needs to get styled up for a date with her
      online acquaintance. With each task successfully solved, players gather points. These can then be invested in new
      furnishings such as a brand new photo studio or a high-tech massage table.</story>

    <story>Bejeweled Twist is a tile matching game, where the player rotates groups of four jewels to create rows and
      columns of three or more matching gems. In the Classic and Zen modes, the objective is to make enough matches to
      fill a tube at the left side of the screen to move to the next level. There's a chain meter at the top of this
      tube, that builds up with matches in a row multiplying the points, and making a fruit jewel appear when full. A
      box at the tube bottom shows the sequence of matches needed for bonus points.

      Obstacles appear randomly on the game board. The coal can't be matched, but it can be exploded by one of the
      power-ups gems. The locked jewel is chained to its place and can't move, but it can be removed with a match. Bomb
      gems display the number of moves allowed before they explode, destroying the board and ending the game. They have
      to be matched before their counters reach zero, otherwise a revolving wheel-of-fortune appears that stops in one
      of two values, skulls or gems, that either detonate or disarm the bomb. This mini-game becomes more difficult
      every time it comes up.

      The power-ups appear after making matches of four or more gems. A four jewel match creates the flame gem, that
      explodes when matched removing all surrounding jewels. A five jewel match creates the lightning gem, that destroys
      a column and a row at the same time in a cross of fire.

      With the exception of Classic Mode , the other modes are unlocked with continuous playing. Zen Mode is similar to
      Classic, but is more relaxed without the bomb and locked jewels. Challenge Mode is a puzzle mode, where the
      objective is to perform a task, like removing all gems of one color, or making a number of matches in a row. In
      Blitz Mode, the goal is to accumulate the maximum amount of points possible within a time limit.</story>

      It is a classic waitress game where the player controls Betty to manage the crowd visiting the club. Gameplay is
      divided into two shifts. She has to direct customers to seats, take their orders and serve them. Orders include
      candy, a milkshake or a specific song from the band. Based on the speed Betty fulfils the requests, a tip is
      awarded. Serving is done through the stylus by matching the correct colours, but Betty also has to keep an eye on
      the crowd kept outside by doorman Gorilla and the rest the band needs between songs.

      When the first shift is completed, Betty enters the stage to perform. A bar of notes is shown on the top screen
      and players need to select the corresponding notes in the correct order on the bottom screen to wow the audience.

      By doing well through both shifts, a gold star is awarded. It can be used in the following shifts to trigger the
      power mode where Betty uses her charm to entertain all guests at once. Customers such as Snobby Sally, Goons, Lazy
      Bones, Slobs, Critics and Military boys all have different characteristics and needs that are to be taken into

      survive with. With the original Regenerator destroyed beyond repair, the trio must head to planet Earth to rescue
      Stoker, who can help them create another.

      Biker Mice From Mars is a hybrid of a racing game, and a side-scrolling beat-em-up. Take the role of Vinnie, Modo
      or Throttle, and race against opponents as well as beating them up in your quest to rescue the planet Mars. During
      the racing sections of the game, you can fire rockets at your foes (once collected from crates scattered on the
      track), or boost ahead of opponents. You're also racing against a time limit, and must make it to the end of the
      track before time is up. Destroying enemies will add precious seconds to your timer.

      The beat-em-up sections are fairly straightforward. You walk to the end of each stage, beating up opponents with
      punches and kicks as you progress. The screen locks into place when a group of enemies appear, and you must beat
      them before you can move on. The mice can also pick up thrown grenades and throw them back at enemies, as well as
      climb up and down certain objects to take different paths.</story>

      Bionicle Heroes DS is a classic first-person shooter. As a nameless Matoran, you'll travel across 25 themed levels
      (including jungles, lava-worlds, ancient underground temples) discovering new weapons and new robotic foes to
      blast apart. Along the way, you'll use the masks' powers to survive the hostile environments as well as collect

      The levels in the game are populated by a large visual variety of Bionicle-inspired bad guys, including ones that
      transform, fly, roll, or charge at you with scorpion-like stingers. Fortunately, you'll be able to upgrade your
      weapons and destroy them with plasma blasts, lightning, and sniper lasers.

      The game also contains a robust local multiplayer mode that allows up to 4-players to compete in deathmatches in

    <story>Bomberman Land Touch! is the second Bomberman game for the Nintendo DS (Bomberman being the first game) and
      it changes the usual gameplay of Bomberman for a mix of adventure and mini-games.

      In the story mode, all the bombermen travel to Bomber Island, a pirate theme park, invited by Giant Gold (yellow
      bomberman), whose father is rich and has rented the park for a day. The goal of Giant Gold is to conquer the
      island with the help of the rest of the bombermen, all of which are named after their colors: Cheerful White (the
      player), Giant Gold, Cool Black, Kid Blue, Pretty Pink (the only girl) and Bookworm Green.

      Once the game starts, we control Cheerful White and we can explore the whole island, which consists in 5 different
      areas: Spades (the starting point), Diamonds, Hearts and Clubs area, where pieces of the same name can be
      collected, and the castle. This pieces are collected mostly by winning at mini-games, which are usually based on
      bombs and serve as the attractions of the park, and are used to open new areas of the map. There is also plenty of
      characters that give you useful information or send you to solve some quest. The rest of the bombermen will also
      give you info and quests, and sometimes they will wait you at some of the attractions that you finished and
      challenge you to it.

      In addition to this game mode, there is the Attraction mode and Battle mode, both multiplayer. In the first one,
      all the attractions already won can be replayed. In the Battle mode, which is played only with buttons (unlike in
      the other two modes), the multiplayer mode of the previous Bomberman is recovered. The only difference between
      both battle modes (as modes, levels, option etc. are exactly the same) is that each of the contenders have to have
      their own cartridge of the game in the Land Touch version.</story>

    <story>Bubble-blowing dragons Bub and Bob return (now with buddy Bubu in tow) for a more traditional 2D platform
      romp than earlier DS title Bubble Bobble Revolution, still however retaining some of its gameplay innovations.

      The basic gameplay is as has lasted the test of time: expelling bubbles from their mouths, the adorable dragons
      first incapacitate monsters by enveloping them in bubbles, then put them out of commission by popping the
      containing bubble (replacing the enemy with a tasty piece of fruit!) -- each level ending with every enemy popped,
      through ten worlds of ten levels each with a boss fight at the end of each world. A trapped monster, if left
      unpopped, will eventually free itself, now red, angry, fast and aggressive, and if it takes too long for the
      dragons to clean up a level, the notorious invincible ghost whale "Baron von Blubba" appears to turn up the heat.

      Things escalate in complexity quite quickly, however, considering that each dragon blows a different colour of
      bubble -- and that some enemies (designated by colour-coded stars) can only be trapped by certain-coloured
      bubbles. (Complicating things further, some enemies need to be trapped by combinations of two differently-coloured
      bubbles before they're down for the count. These elements remain even in single-player mode, where the player has
      the option of toggling their colour mid-game to produce the necessary bubble colour.)

      An array of traditional power-ups (shot distance, movement speed, etc.), weapons (lightning bolts, floods and
      firebombs) and bonuses (freeze enemies, invincibility, flood level, etc.) remain in effect, as does the
      longstanding E-X-T-E-N-D bonus mechanism -- here regulated (among other effects) through subtle machinations of
      the new star bubble type.

      When player lives are expended, the option of continuing is granted according to player performance in mini-games
      making use of the DS touchscreen and stylus, ramping up in difficulty through every continue used.</story>

    <story>After her sailboat crashed in Mount Tikikola Beach, Patty Melton decided to start a new life. She gets a work
      at Beach Burger. To her surprise, the owners decide to retire and leave her their business. Now, as the main
      "chef" in Beach Burger, Patty has to spread her franchise all the way to the capital city of Honochuchu.

      Burger Island is an action game which simulates a burger restaurant. The player has to prepare burgers, shakes and
      fries made of over 30 different recipes. The gameplay consists in clicking in the ingredients and placing them in
      the correct order for each recipe. For a hamburger, for instance, the player has to click in the burger stack to
      pick one and then click in the grill to start frying it. The player has to wait for it to get well done and then
      place it in the bread, adding ketchup and the top slice. Each order has a time limit to be done, or else the
      customer will quit waiting. Also, Patty starts working at 10:30 AM and ends at 9:00 PM, and has to reach a daily
      goal. If she fails to reach it, she'll lose a life.

      Each stage has a different kind of order to be prepared, being it burgers, shakes or fries. At first, Patty knows
      only one recipe of each kind of order, but in between levels new recipes can be bought. New recipes are harder to
      prepare, but are also more expensive. Earning more money is necessary as the stages go by due to the higher goals
      to be reached. As the daily shift remains the same, more expensive recipes are needed to reach the daily goal.

      The game has a total of 60 levels and three difficulty levels.</story>

      In addition there is the Crash mode, where the goal is to create as much wreckage as possible by ploughing the
      player car into the traffic. The different race types include Race, Time Attack, Road Rage, Pursuit, Face Off,
      Eliminator, Burning Lap, and Grand Prix. Multiplayer game modes include Race, Road Rage, Pursuit, special Crash
      modes Double Impact and Party Crash (all these can can be played as single events or as a tournament), and
      Collector Challenge where the player has the opportunity to win other player's Collector cars.

      PSP version game sharing feature allows others to play multiplayer events or single player demo without their own

    <story>Jill is a young baker who acquired her passion for baking from her grandparents in their bakery, Evans
      Bakery. When she returned from culinary school, she discovered Evans Bakery closed down because a "Mega-Mart"
      moved in. Jill decides to show the mega corporation what her family's baking is all about and opened her own
      bakery in order to earn enough money to buy back Evans Bakery. Can Jill handle the pressure of running her own
      business and beat Mega-Mart?

      In Cake Mania, your job is to help Jill meet the monthly quota through 48 progressively difficult levels. This is
      no simple task because you will have to bake quickly as well as serve the customers quickly.

      There are a variety of different customers to serve. From nice old ladies to impatient holiday icons like Cupid!
      Each kind of customer have a different patience-level (indicated by the number of hearts). The longer they wait,
      the lower their patience. If they get too low, they will storm off and cost you money!

      When a customer first enters your bakery, hand them a menu. Then they will give you their order (in the form of a
      thought bubble) and you will have to create that cake. If you create the wrong cake (wrong shape or wrong
      frosting, etc) then you will have to throw it away and start over (costing you more money). You start off with one
      oven and one frosting machine. Between levels you will have the opportunity to purchase upgrades or new items that
      will improve the bakery's. For example, you can purchase upgrade your oven to one that bakes faster or you can
      purchase a T.V. that will help improve customers' patience.</story>

    <story>Set in the early 19th century, this installment of the long running Castlevania series takes a slight
      departure from the typical series storyline. A secret monastic organization, Order of Ecclesia, is charged with
      finding alternative ways of combating the hordes of undead summoned by the ever-returning evil lord Dracula, as
      the Belmont clan has apparently gone into hiding. Shanoa, a young acolyte of the Order, is chosen for her
      extraordinary magical abilities to wield Dominus: the ultimate spell against evil. As she is about to complete the
      ritual to absorb Dominus a rogue acolyte named Albus steals the three tomes containing the spell. Shanoa is then
      dispatched to track down Albus and return him and the spell back to the Order.</story>

    <story>Revive the classic shooting game with your Nintendo DS and use your Stylus as your gun to hunt the chickens
      that you see in the screen or complete the puzzles and reach the highest score under a time limit. The game
      features different game modes:

      Classic mode: Hunt as many chickens as you can in a single stage to reach the highest score under a time limit.
      It's essentially the classic chicken shoot.

      Weight mode: In weight mode chickens approach by air. Move side to side and fire your hefty cannon to the right
      chicken depending of the color of your weight (your bullet). Three weights of the same color to the same chicken
      and you've done your main objective.

      Gems mode: Here you cannot move side to side. You must shoot the chickens to make them release a gem where three
      metallic containers reside. Line up the gems to get extra points just like the classic Columns game.

      Hotwire mode: A kind of racing game in which you control your car with your stylus. Your job is to drag your car
      left or right to avoid hitting the side of the track. Every time that you finish the track the speed is increased.

      Spot the difference mode: Use Nintendo DS dual screen you'll have to find the differences between two images. The
      right picture is in the upper screen and you'll have to tap the differences in the touch screen with your stylus.

    <story>Inspired by the "superhero movie within the movie" finale of Walt Disney Pictures' film "Chicken Little,"
      Disney"s Chicken Little: Ace in Action features Ace, the superhero alter ego of Chicken Little, and the Hollywood
      versions of his misfit band of friends: Runt, Abby and Fish-Out-of-Water. The crew of the intergalactic Battle
      Barn faces off against Foxy Loxy and her evil Amazonian sidekick, Goosey Loosey, who have an evil plan to take
      over Earth. Battle evil alien robots through multiple levels across the solar system and combat your foes in one
      of three distinct game play modes: Ace on foot as a soldier, Runt as the driver of an armored tank, or Abby as the
      pilot of a spaceship. The original Chicken Little and his friends Abby, Runt and Fish we know from the film are

    <story>Chicken Shoot is a gallery shooting game based on free 2003 flash game of the same name. The player shoots
      all the chickens that appear on the 2D hand-drawn screens. The top screen is used to show the gameplay, while the
      bottom one shows statistics such as the remaining time, the score, the type of gun and the remaining ammo. The
      game can be controlled through the buttons, or in combination with the stylus to aim at the chickens.

      The basic game modes are identical to those of the Wii version: Arcade (shoot a specific number of chickens),
      Classic (time limit) and Catch an Egg (a mini-game where eggs need to be caught before they drop on the ground).
      Different kinds of guns can be picked up and every now and then enemies thrown an egg towards the screen that
      needs to be blown up quickly. Extra points are awarded for shooting certain background items, bombs destroy
      everything on the screen, food can be picked up to refill energy (Arcade) and clocks add more time (Classic).
      There are six levels/environments: The Village, The Forest, Nevada Desert, Antarctica, Rocky Island and Sahara.

      There are two multi-player modes: cooperative gameplay for two players or a four-player competitive game mode
      where players need to score as much points as possible in a set amount of time.</story>

    <story>Some years before the action begins, a great catastrophe began at the base of the Mana Tree. This gives the
      main characters, Ferrik, Tamber, Poppen and Wanderer, who's parents were killed in the disaster, reason to find
      out what happened. The game takes place on the Island of Illusia, at the center of which lies the Mana Tree.

      The game is a real time Action/RPG very similar to the style of Secret of Mana. New features include dual weapon
      systems, so characters can use one long range and one melee weapon at a time.

      Although there is much more that can be done with each weapon, there are only four in the game, as opposed to
      twice as many in previous titles.

      The game supports Wireless LAN for 4 players.</story>

      encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of
      time.

      Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a
      variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters
      grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks
      and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle.

      The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of
      turn-based and real-time combat - adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use
      Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities
      at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible
      to just pass by them entirely.

      The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different
      endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game,
      and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.</story>

    <story>When a mysterious alien being arrives on planet Skyla, the planet's inhabitants tried to make peace with it.
      However, its intentions were anything but... destroying all in its wake and forcing the planet's inhabitants to
      flee as none of their weapons could even harm it. Study revealed that the alien was able to exist in two different
      times simultaneously, and could only be harmed in both. A special time machine was built - one that can transport
      someone into the past and the present at the same time...

      Chronos Twin is a side-scrolling platform game with a difference - the action takes place on both Nintendo DS
      screens simultaneously. The top screen shows the player in the present, while the touch screen shows the player in
      the past. Pressing the A Button will make both the past and present player jump simultaneously. While there are
      certain differences in the past and the present (for example, a platform in the past may not exist in the
      present), as long as the player is standing on the platform in one time period, they won't fall.

      The player also has a weapon at their disposal - a gun which can be fired in the present with the X Button, and
      the past with the B Button. However - the gun cannot be fired in both time periods simultaneously. The gun can
      also be charged up by holding down the button, releasing a more powerful blast.

      After a certain point in the game, the player is also able to stop time in one period while moving about freely in
      another period. This can be used to move blocks to allow both present and past players to get through, or to
      release platforms that a player in one time period couldn't reach.</story>

    <story>Code Lyoko is a game based on the French animated television series. Five boarding school students - Ulrich,
      Odd, Jeremy and Yumi - fight against a digital entity named X.A.N.A. They travel to the virtual world of Lyoko and
      help their virtual friend Aelita fend off X.A.N.A.s forces.

      The game follows both aspects of the kids' lives, and the player can enjoy 3D Action Role Playing within the world
      of Lyoko and 2D Adventuring in the real world.

      The game is made of 15 chapters, and each chapter is split into two portions. One portion is a PC-style 2D
      point-and-click adventure, where you take control of one of the characters to visit different locations, talk to
      people, gather items, and generally watch the story unfold. The other portion is a 3D action level where you swap
      among characters and use their abilities to fight monsters, hop between platforms, or climb up hillsides in search
      of the tower that'll put and end to whatever problem is currently pestering the real world. Occasionally, the
      player has to solve touch-screen puzzles and pass vehicle-based levels.</story>

    <story>Color Cross is a picture puzzle game similar to Picross, where the objective is to fill all the correct cells
      in a grid to form a picture. Each row and column has a series of numbers as clues, indicating the groups of
      continuous cells that must be painted. The player must use logic to discover the remaining spots and complete the
      figure.

      The main difference this time is the addition of multiple colors per picture, instead of the monochromatic
      approach of other titles. Players can select back and forth between colors by clicking on the palette at the side
      of the screen. Cells can be painted individually or as a group by clicking and dragging across them with the
      cursor. In each color option, cells can be marked with an X to point them out as incorrect places. Any mistakes
      are corrected automatically, affecting the final score.

      New levels are unlocked with each completed picture. They are organized by picture theme at the level selection
      menu. Every time a line or column is completed, the clue numbers become grayed out and a shower of candies,
      fairies and other theme-related items fall from it to the bottom of the screen.</story>

      professor needs to make repairs to his ship. Subtly guide Terry around the island (and later on, the world!) to
      help them both.

      Contact is an adventure game with a difference. The professor from the game is aware of your presence, but his
      assistant, Terry, is not. You indirectly control Terry by moving him around the game world and issue commands to
      him. Every action that Terry makes has a corresponding statistic, and these can be levelled up by using them
      frequently. Run everywhere, and Terry's speed will increase. Take damage, and while your health will decrease,
      your stamina will increase, allowing you to take more hits. Steal items and your thievery skills will increase,
      and so on.

      The game also supports the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Swap Friend Codes with other people, and when you connect to
      their game on the Internet, you'll be able to exchange data, as well as send an NPC version of your character into

      This installment of the long-running series adds dual screen gameplay, enabling the player a wider view, and a

      features nine levels set in such classic Contra locations as Jungle, Waterfall and a pseudo-3D Base.

    <story>Similar to The Incredible Machine the player needs to use animated parts to assemble a Rube Goldberg-type
      contraption and solve puzzles by doing so.

      The game features three different modes: Classic, Arcade or Construction Kit. The classic mode requires the player
      to place the parts and manually activate the machine to get the ball to it's goal, the arcade mode confronts the
      player with an already finished and running machine which needs a little help. By using the stylus or blowing into
      the microphone the player not only moves the ball through the experiment but also activates and uses the parts of
      the machine. By successfully completing all those puzzles, the player unlocks additional components which are then
      at his disposal in the construction kit to freely construct anything he wants without a time or space limit.

      Although the game doesn't feature a traditional multiplayer-mode, the players can trade their experiments with
      friends over the wireless connection.</story>

    <story>This adaptation of the classic Chinese board game offers 100 level for single-player sessions, with three
      difficulty levels. The levels can also be played in a campaign mode, with twelve illustrated stations. The main
      aim of the game is to make pairs of blocks disappear on a board where they are stapled on different layers.
      Removing matching blocks reveals the ones below, until the entire board is cleared or the player is stuck. The
      game includes a help function and blocks can be immediately selected using the stylus. There are different themes
      of blocks to choose from, including classic Chinese characters but also more general symbol. The game keeps track
      of the remaining blocks, the score, and there is an undo function.</story>

    <story>The fifth game in the Custom Robo series, Custom Robo Arena moves the action into the portable realm again
      with the first entry on the DS. It is the first in the series to be released in PAL territories, and the second in
      North America.

      The story has the player's character joining the Robo Team 'Numero Uno' and the story unfolds as they attempt to
      win the Robo Cup. Like all the Custom Robo games, except the GBA incarnation, the battles are conducted in 3D,
      with the player attempting to defeat their opponent, in a Pokémon fashion similar to the previous games. The touch
      screen is used to clean off the player's Robo after it becomes dirty, as this reduces its efficiency.

      In another first it offers 2 player multiplayer over Nintendo Wi-Fi and allows voice chat and utilises the rivals
      system seen in Metroid Prime: Hunters.</story>

    <story>In this throwback to the early days of CRPGs you must explore the Dark Spire dungeon with a party of up to
      four characters.

      Party creation is basic by most modern standards.
      Four races, three alignments, four classes along with five different stat points are all there are to decide what
      your character is.

      These four characters begin the game inexperienced and weak like almost every RPG. They gain skills, power and
      better quality items as they progress through the various dungeons.

      Experience points are spent on skills for the characters, some of these opening the choice to upgrade one of the 4
      basic classes to become a different prestige class, offering different abilities.

      The game is played without use of the touchscreen and only uses the direction pad and buttons. The top screen
      displays the party location in 3d and the bottom screen has info on their status.</story>

      start of the game, the player choose one of the 26 briefcases. They contain prize money ranging from $.01 to
      $1,000,000. The different amounts are shown on a game board. Each round the player has to open a number of the
      remaining briefcases which are then marked on the board (six in the first round, five in the second, four in the
      third). Based on the remaining amount of money, the banker offers the player a deal, a certain amount of money,

      the third round the briefcase is opened and if it contains a higher sum than what the banker offered, the player
      has made a great deal.

      In singleplayer, three modes are available: TV Game (classic gameplay), Vault Game (Find the 3-number combination
      to a vault in the correct order in as few turns as possible. The initial prize is $500,000 and each turn the prize
      fund is reduced.) and High Low (Pick a briefcase and then make a calculated guess if the next briefcase will

    <story>Death Jr. makes his way to the Nintendo DS from his PSP franchise. The player takes control of Death Jr. and
      his friend Pandora as they embark on a mission to save their friends Smith and Weston, Stigmartha and Seep from
      their own creation.

      While attending their school's science fair, they accidentally unleash an ancient and evil demon by the name of
      Moloch who threatens to bring an end to their world. The player can switch between either D.J. or Pandora, using a
      plethora of creative weapons like C-4 hamsters, firearms which range from pistols to shotguns as well as D.J.'s
      trusty scythe to decimate the enemies.

      The gameplay consists of using both the stylus to perform touch-screen gestures and pressing regular pad buttons
      to create a variety of attacks. There is also multiplayer with two mini-games that can be played between friends.
      One of which is Reaper Ricochet where players bounce C-4 hamsters off of tombstones at each other and the other is
      War Mode where two teams can engage each other in side-scrolling shoot-em up's.</story>

    <story>Deep Labyrinth is a slow-paced first person dungeon exploration game for Nintendo DS.
      The movement is controlled with D-pad, while all of the game’s attacks are executed through touch-screen. Deep
      Labyrinth’s magic system requires the player to draw symbols – Kirie on a 3x3 grid, in order to cast spells. As
      the game progresses, the Kirie become more and more complex, eventually requiring strings of up to 9 unique
      symbols.

      The game is split into two chapters different enough to be separate games.

      In the first chapter tells the story of a boy named Shawn, whose family is stranded on the roadside by a blown
      tire. His parents go off to find help, but mysteriously vanish. As it’s getting late, and a storm is approaching
      Shawn and the family pet – dog named Ace, seek shelter in an apparently abandoned mansion close by, but as they
      do, both are transported into a bizarre fantasy world. Apparently, this world is a place where unneeded human
      memories are sent do be erased, and as we find out – Shawn’s parents’ memories of him and each other are scheduled
      for deletion. This sets our hero on a quest to save his family and, perhaps discover the dark secrets of the world
      of memories.

      The second chapter casts you as a hero mysteriously transported into an unnamed dungeon, where he soon discovers a
      girl trapped in a crystal. The hero has a vague recollection of once knowing the girl, but it is suggested that
      she died long ago. From that point on the game becomes about escaping the dungeon and saving the girl.

      The two chapters are different enough to be separate games. Chapter one is fleshed out with NPCs, dialogue, and
      story event cutscenes, as well as a several lengthy anime FMVs, while the second chapter is much darker, and
      features very little in terms of story, focusing on the combat instead.</story>

      Diddy, Dixie, Tiny Kong and the rogue Kremling Krunch turn up to help Timber and his friends, Bumper, Tiptup and
      Pipsy.

      Diddy Kong Racing DS is remake of the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. However, while the story and setting
      remains the same, this is more of an upgrade instead of a port. Players can still race around assorted tracks
      around Tiger Island via kart, hovercraft or plane, winning races to earn golden balloons to progress and defeating
      bosses to confront Wizpig.

      There have been subtle tweaks to the gameplay. While you can still level up your balloons by collecting another of
      the same colored balloon in a row, collecting a different colored balloon will not change your weapon - you'll
      have to fire your current weapon first. The Silver Coin Challenge from the original game has been removed from the
      main adventure, and is replaced with a first-person touch screen shooter where you fly around on Taj's magic
      carpet and aim to pop as many balloons as you can. There's also an optional racing mode where you race by using
      the stylus to guide the vehicle through a top-down map.

      The game now supports currency system for most unlockables - dotted along the track are coins, which can be used
      to buy 'wishes' from Taj the Genie. These include anything from new characters, exclusive tracks, a custom track
      editor, battle modes to unlock in multiplayer and so forth. The DS version of Diddy Kong Racing also heavily
      supports multiplayer. You can play with one game card or multiple game cards (to a maximum of eight players), or
      online to a maximum of six players. Similar to Mario Kart DS, you can design your own custom decal and have it as
      your visual representation for when you race around the world.</story>

    <story>The angel LuLu asks high school student Akuji Nishimura to locate a witch who has sneaked into his school.
      There are 8 possible suspects, between 12 and 23 years old, with different abilities such as transformation,
      energy balls, potions, teleportation and more. To find her, Akuji has to gather enough evidence to corner one of
      the suspects, and then the player has to touch her with the stylus, guiding Akuji's hands, to check for a witch
      mark. This curious feature, although a minor part of the game, made it infamously dubbed
      that-Japanese-young-witches-toucher. In these scenes, Akuji can flirt with the characters, show them items and
      perform actions such as kissing, touching, or jiggling their breasts. The visual style is anime-inspired.

      The game interface is similar to the Japanese date simulations. Players just have to pick a location. If there is
      an important character present, the story continues, otherwise another location needs to be chosen. Most of the
      game takes place inside the school, but there are also a few areas outside of it. After a certain amount of items
      and information, Akuji faces a boss. By tapping the stylus, he can deflect energy balls and attack. A certain
      amount of characters can be unlocked, granting new abilities during battle. During scenario sets, black pandas
      appear, used to unlock new gameplay options.</story>

      secret boss. Players use the stylus to draw shapes 'magical runes' on the DS touch screen, which then travel
      towards your opponent on the other side of the playing area. In the playing area is a circular drawing board on
      which you draw runes that activate your spells, assuming there is currently enough mana to do so. Once cast, a
      little icon starts moving anti-clockwise around the board, up towards an image of the opponent (at the 12 o'clock
      position). If it hits your opponent the effects of the spell are manifested, whether it's simply inflicting
      damage, cursing them with effects.

      Both players players have a shield which can be activated by pressing their own icon (at the six o'clock
      position). The shield only last few a few seconds before needing to recharge and some spells are able to cut
      through it, so players need to keep an eye on not only which spells are traveling towards them, but how their
      spells are likely to be received by their opponent. Tactics are used to combine these runes both in timing and
      effect.</story>

    <story>Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2 gameplay follows closely to its predecessor. Players explore areas and tame
      wild monsters into their party. Monsters fight in turn-based combat and grow stronger. The battle system itself is
      very similar to previous Dragon Quest Monsters games. The player controls up to three monsters that make up the
      party, and can issue them direct orders or set them to one of 4 AI settings. This game features two new monster
      sizes: large monsters, which use up two spaces on one of the player's two benches, and gargantuan monsters, who
      take up an entire bench on their own. The main character, who is henceforth referred to as the Hero, does not
      directly participate in battles except for when the player uses items. He can, however, use any item in his
      possession and not just the ones 'in hand'. 311 monsters from the Dragon Quest games appear in Joker 2, with a few
      new species, many from the original "Dragon Warrior Monsters" games. This is the second game in the series to
      feature Wi-Fi support, after the first Joker game, and the first to support direct battling between players.
      Square Enix released Joker 2 Professional, an expanded version of the game, on March 31, 2011. Professional
      features over 100 new monsters, as well as new regions and abilities, but the same story. Players are able to
      import their old monsters from the original game.</story>

      genauer gesagt: auf die Geisterinsel, wo er der steinreichen Miss Wilbur beim Bau eines Themenparks helfen soll.

      Die Helden unserer Jugend sind bereit für die nächste Generation. Das offizielle Spiel zum Film spielt an den
      Original-Schauplätzen, und liefert mehr als nur die Geschichte des Films. Geschickt werden die Handlungsstränge
      des Films vertieft und weitere Abenteuer und Rätsel hinzugefügt.

    <story>Können Justus, Peter und Bob das Geheimnis um die mysteriöse Schatztruhe und das verschollene chinesische
      „Buch der Wandlungen“ lösen? Das neue Das Spiel bietet ein klassisches Adventure mit vielen Missionen, Rätseln und
      anspruchsvoller Detektivarbeit. Bei verschiedenen Minigames hilft der Spieler den drei Freunden dabei, Schätze mit
      dem Metalldetektor zu suchen, alte Speicher nach Hinweisen zu durchforsten, Phantombilder zu erstellen oder Victor
      Hugenay zu jagen. Die Lösung des Geheimnisses erfordert detektivisches Geschick und Logik, aber auch
      Reaktionsvermögen. Kenntnisse über frühere Fälle der drei Freunde sind bei der Aufklärung des Falles sehr
      hilfreich, doch ein sorgfältig erstelltes Karteikartenarchiv in der Zentrale erleichtert auch dem Die drei
      ???-Neuling die Recherchearbeit.
      Die spannende Detektivstory ist eigens brandneu erdacht worden und so noch in keinem Die drei ???-Hörspiel oder
      -Buch aufgetaucht.</story>

    <story>In Electroplankton players interact with various "plankton" to create "media art". Using the DS touch screen,
      microphone, and other input methods, you can make the plankton to react, creating numerous audio and visual
      experiences.

      There are two modes Performance and Audience. In Audience, the plankton will perform for you, as long as you see
      fit, or your battery will allow. In Performance you can interact with the plankton and create your own
      audio-visual show.

      The Various Plankton are as follows

      1. Tracy: You will have several plankton. They will move along lines you draw for them, their speed varying on how
      quickly you drew the lines. The sound they create changes depending on their speed and where they are on the
      screen.

      2. Hanenbow: These little creatures launch out of a small body of water and bounce off the leaves of plants.
      Depending on the levees they bounce off of they will create different sounds.

      3. Luminaria: You will have four plankton on a grid. Each has a different speed. Depending on what point on the
      grid they hit they will make a different sound. Arrows on the grid, that you can alter, will determine where they
      move.

      4. Sun-Animalcule: You place these little creatures on the screen and they will grow. As the become larger they
      will create different sounds.

      5. Rec-Rec: Using the mic you can record four samples that then replay with various drumloops.

      6. Nanocarp: These little plankton move about the screen randomly, they will alter how they move according to what
      you input. Touching one will make it "pling" and clapping twice will make them swim in a circle.

      7. Lumiloop: You spin them around. They glow and make sound according to the direction and speed.

      8. Marine-Snow – Each of these plankton will make a tone when touched, and move about.

      9. Beatnes: Plays NES music and you can create repeating NES-esque music by touching the plankton on various parts
      of their bodies.

      10. Volvoice: This plankton will record you voiced and the play it back in different ways.</story>

    <story>In Elements of Destruction the player can unleash the most volatile forces on Earth such as tornadoes,
      lightning storms, ice storms, earthquakes and meteor storms, wreaking havoc on unsuspecting cities and causing
      massive amounts of damage and creating complete and utter chaos.

      The story tells of a TV weatherman by the name of Marty Storm who is fired from his job for reporting the truth
      about bad weather conditions instead of lying about good weather conditions in which the station's producer hopes
      will result in better ratings. Afterwards he vows revenge as his former co-workers ridicule him, unknown to them
      however, Marty Storm is also a part-time mad scientist that has created a device that can create disasters at
      will. With this device, Storm goes on a quest to bring the city and his former co-workers to their knees. The
      gameplay is divided into three weeks (levels) which have seven days, each with their own set of goals. Some
      consist of causing a set amount of damage, others consist of destroying a certain percentage of building while
      others consist of destroying certain buildings. These objectives must be done within a certain time limit.

      To conjure these storms a menu is on the right side of the bottom screen which has a list of disasters available
      (some are only available on certain days). After selecting their disaster they use the stylus pen to create a path
      of destruction for the tornadoes and storms or pick a certain point for either the earthquake or meteors. For the
      storms and tornadoes, players can click onto them with the stylus and continue to change their path until the run
      out. Additionally, the player must have a certain amount of energy to be able to select them which regenerates
      over time or can be obtained by destroying buildings. To help the player, a mini-map is also located at the top of
      the screen which shows locations of buildings, which types of buildings they are and the buildings health status.

      Each storm also has their own special attacks which are only available after they reach a level three later into
      the game and can be accessed by clicking an icon above the disaster. The tornado becomes much more powerful and
      has the ability to cause more damage. The lightning storm can cause fires to buildings which the player can then
      blow into the DS' microphone to fan the flames and spread them. The ice storm causes a blizzard which will weaken
      buildings for other storms. The earthquake will become more powerful when the player continually taps the center
      of the earthquake with the meteor storm has the same effect.

      However there are attempts to halt the players progress which certain buildings that can instantly stop the
      players selected disaster. A tornado trapper can suck up a tornado while a cloud cruncher takes out lightning and
      ice storms. The seismic nullifer prevents earthquakes while the meteor shield keeps meteors from destroying
      buildings and the weather sucker stops both tornadoes and storms. The storm free zone building prevents any
      disaster from being performed around it and a weather repeller bounces storms and tornadoes off of them. There are
      also two types of drones that come in from time to time: a repairing drone will fly around and repair a building
      while a rebuilding drone will instantly bring a building back without any time to rebuild it. The player can use
      the lightning storm to hover above these drones and destroy them.

      Power-ups are also scattered throughout the level which will upgrade their storm or disaster to the next level for
      a brief amount of time. To use these power-ups, the player must have their storm or disaster consume them, however
      the color much match the disaster that is being used, otherwise the power-up will have no effect.

      There are also multiplayer modes that support up to three different players. A race mode lets players complete a
      certain set of objectives given to them with the winner being the first player to complete them. There is also a
      Tug-of-War where the main objective is to either have the largest amount of destruction monetary wise or through a
      certain percentage.</story>

    <story>Elite Beat Agents is the spiritual sequel to Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! In this rhythm-based music game, the
      Elite Beat Agents are a special task force dedicated to helping people in need and righting wrongs through the
      power of song.

      The game is played entirely through use of the stylus. Timing is required to line up the rings that close in on
      the circles to ensure the proper beat for the song. Beats can also be scored by dragging a glowing ball through a
      set line area until the end of a beat. Finally, players will be required to turn a spinner as quickly as possible
      during a music break.

      The level stories are mostly comedic, where the Agents will help a girl and her jock boyfriend go steady, help a
      speeding taxi driver deliver a baby, and even help a weather reporter chase away rain clouds to go on a picnic
      with her son. Each level is accompanied by popular songs such as Madonna's "Material Girl", Chicago's "You're the
      Inspiration", or Jamiroquai's "Canned Heat", among others, for 19 music tracks total.

      Multiplayer allows gamers to compete against each other via single-card or multi-card play.</story>

    <story>Far away in a vast fertile land lies a small town called Etria. Peaceful and serene, Etria became famous when
      a labyrinth was discovered at the edge of its woods. Those who heard of the labyrinth began to harbor dreams of
      exploring it. And so many explorers from all over the world flocked to Etria in dream of achieving wealth, fame,
      and fortune exploring the vast and mysterious labyrinth.

      Etrian Odyssey is a first-person RPG which pits you as an eager adventurer ready to face the dangers of the
      labyrinth. At the beginning of the game you are required to create your own "adventuring guild" by creating
      various characters out of 9 different classes. You can create as many as you want, but everything costs money, so
      strategic thinking is a must. As well, you can only take a party of 5 into the labyrinth, so the remaining
      characters have to stay in town at the guild hall. Battles are done in the traditional turn-based style, and he
      game contains over 125 monsters that guard the labyrinth and the area around it. Movement is done one step at a
      time, with players moving in restricted directions (forward, back, left right). Most of the game is focused on
      exploring deeper and deeper into the labyrinth while still returning to town in order to restock and resupply.
      During the return trips to town, you can also switch out characters in your party if a special class is needed to
      pass obstacles in the labyrinth. Also, players are only allowed to save during the return trip to town, making
      trips to the labyrinth both risky and exciting.

      The labyrinth is completely unknown and unexplored, and so one of the important features of the game is the
      necessity to draw your own maps. The top screen of the DS shows the action, while the bottom screen shows a
      gridded area. In this area, you have to use the stylus to draw out all of your maps. This means not only marking
      where the walls and doors are, but having to mark where enemies, treasures, special areas, and staircases are. It
      is completely up to you how accurately or haphazardly you want to draw your map. However, the only way to get out
      of the labyrinth is to return to the start, so the gameplay becomes even riskier the further you venture into the
      dungeon. Managing your map poorly may risk you and party's lives. Map making is a key concept of this game because
      it emphasizes adventuring into the unknown and finding out what's around the very next corner.</story>

    <story>Fantasy Aquarium by DS is a fish tank simulation. Contrary to Aquarium by DS by the same developer, which is
      limited to "normal" aquarium suiting fishes, the player of this game can choose from 30 different underwater
      animals which can't be held in fish tanks in real life (e.g. whales, dolphins, sharks, penguins). Additionally,
      the player can customize their tank in size and add different backgrounds and accessories like plants, rocks or
      even buildings like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. New fish types can be unlocked by taking good care of the aquariums
      residents.

      And that's the aim of the game, taking care of the fishes in the tank. They need to be fed, the tank has to be
      cleaned and water temp and salinity have to be adjusted to create a perfect environment. A wrong environment or an
      unsuitable mix of animals in the tank, for example killer whales and penguins at the same time, will result in the
      death of the players pets. Instead of swimming dead at the surface or bloody death animations they simply
      disappear from the screen. Not playing the game for a few days and therefore not feeding, will result in a deadly
      surprise, too.

      Using the Wi-Fi-feature of the DS the player can swap fishes with other players.</story>

    <story>In 2006, Final Fantasy III reached North American shores in an official update/remake for the Nintendo DS,
      finally bringing all of the main Final Fantasy entries to the United States for the first time.

      Raised as an orphan by Nina and Elder Topapa in the village of Ur, Luneth, his shy friend Arc, the rebellious
      Refia and the brave soldier Ingus are chosen as the Four Warriors of Light to send to restore balance to the
      crystals, and save the world from imminent destruction.

      Taking the original game which debuted on the NES, Square-Enix had updated the title with a new cinematic intro,
      improved graphics and a touch-screen interface to move characters and utilize selection menus. There is also
      Moogle Mail, a Wi-Fi feature that allows players to send messages to each other via their DS systems. The game has
      also some revised story elements, detailing the adventures of four friends who find each other, each with new
      backstories.

      Final Fantasy III is a traditional turn-based RPG, which were popular back in the '80s and '90s, but introduced
      refinements to the genre, such as smarter battle AI. Final Fantasy III is also known for two major milestones in
      the history of the series: Its introduction of the cheerful Moogles, as well as the introduction of the job
      system, allowing characters to switch professions throughout the game for new abilities.</story>

    <story>Final Fantasy IV is a remake of the classic Japanese RPG that was first released for SNES, known as Final
      Fantasy II in the West.

      Unlike the many subsequent ports (to Playstation, GameBoy Advance, etc.), this release is a full remake,
      programmed from scratch with real-time 3D graphics. The characters have a "super-deformed" touch. There is also
      voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a
      conversation between party members and receive advice from them.

      It also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty
      of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even
      beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called
      "augments", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities,
      resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc.

      Beside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after
      exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can
      be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the "naming" moogle of the original game, etc.

    <story>A second retelling of the original Fire Emblem on the Famicom, Shadow Dragon utilises the Nintendo DS online
      options in a first for the long running Fire Emblem series.

      The game offers a graphical enhancement from Ankoku Ry? to Hikari no Ken and Monsh? no Nazo, which was the first
      remake of the original, as well as utilising the dual screens on the Nintendo DS to display the action and
      character stats simultaneously.

      The main story centres on prince Marth as he embarks on a quest to reconquer his home kingdom and rescue his
      kidnapped sister. Characters and chapters that were not present in the original have been introduced in this
      version, as well as some that were omitted for Fire Emblem: Monsh? no Nazo. Over twenty character classes are
      included in the game as well as over fifty individual characters to aid Marth.

      Also included is the ability to save mid battle on special save point so a mistake in the last turn will not force
      a restart. Other features are the class swap for characters to change their abilities. Online battle features up
      to five characters per side in a two player battle.</story>

    <story>The story of New Mystery of the Emblem remains from the original version. The game is set on the continent of
      Archanea, a land also featured in the first Fire Emblem title Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light.
      In Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, the land was threatened by the dark sorcerer Gharnef, who summoned the
      dark dragon Medeus into the world. After becoming a fugitive from his kingdom after an attack on his kingdom,
      Archanean prince Marth went on a quest to reclaim his kingdom and defeat Gharnef and Medeus. By the events of New
      Mystery of the Emblem, Marth's old ally Hardin has ascended the throne, but begins expanding the military and
      dominating the other regions of Archanea. Marth investigates, and discovers that both Gharnef and Medeus are still
      alive, and Hardin has been corrupted by them.[4]

      A new sub-plot introduced in New Mystery of the Emblem involves the inclusion of the Avatar and a group of
      assassins sent by Gharnef to kill Marth and his allies. The assassins initially send a spy named Katarina to
      infiltrate Altea as a new recruit, where she befriends the Avatar and the other members of her squad before
      revealing her true purpose and launching an attack on Marth. The recruits prevent the attack while Katarina
      escapes, and the Avatar is appointed as Marth's personal bodyguard to protect him from future assassinations and
      accompanies him during the war against Archanea as "The Hero of Shadow".</story>

    <story>Football Academy is a mix of a football trivia game and a card game. In it the player gets to enter the
      academy where he under the supervision of former Chelsea and Portugal manager Luiz Felipe Scolari gets to create
      his own team and test his knowledge about the sport. When starting out at the academy the player gets two packs of
      cards with footballers. Once the player has picked his starting eleven out of these he will be able to go to the
      stadium and compete against unlocked teams. Victory in matches and the player is awarded badges, trophies and
      better card packs that allows him to improve his team.

      The player can't go directly to the stadium however. First he must prove his knowledge about game at the
      classroom. Here the player gets to take a Football IQ test consisting of three mini games. The accumulated points
      from the mini games is the player's football IQ which determines how good footballers the player can acquire.
      Early on the player only has access to bronze packs but by defeating teams in the stadium silver and gold packs
      will be unlocked. The test can be redone at any time but first it might be wise for the player to practice the
      mini games on the training pitch.

      Once the player has a team it is time to go to the changing room and manage it. Here the player gets to pick a
      formation and a starting eleven. Each footballer has a number of attributes such as position, nation and skill
      rating. The team also has a chemistry rating which is based on the footballers' home country as well as their
      preferred position and formation. Therefore it's important not only to pick the best ones, but also makes sure
      that they fit with their team mates.

      The actual matches of the game are played similarly to manager games such as Championship Manager where the player
      only gets to see an overview of the action. The tactical possibilities available are more limited here as the only
      options available are where to attack (left, right or center) and the mentality of the team (push up, sit back or
      balanced). What special however is that at different times throughout the matches the player will face dribbling,
      passing and shooting battles. Here one of the footballers will face one of the opponents. Before the battle the
      footballers' ratings are recalculated based on their mentality, chemistry and energy. Then each player gets to
      choose one of two actions and depending on if he is successful or not the footballer's rating increases or
      decreases. The footballer with the highest rating wins the battle. Being successful leads to more and more battles
      until a goal scoring opportunity appears.

      Football Academy has support for two player multi-card play. The players can test out their teams against each
      other but it is also possible to trade footballers.</story>

      This game is an action flight sim with a twist - it also has RPG elements. Each enemy plane you shoot down earns
      your experience points and gold, which unlocks better parts and planes for you to buy. Occasionally during flight
      you receive mayday calls from other planes under attack - if you are able to save them you can meet them back at
      the nearest airfield for a reward.

      If the action is too much for you to handle, it has an autopilot mode which allows you to select targets and

      the Dimensional Abyss was created by the Saint of Light to seal them off in a parallel dimension, afterwards
      Rubenhaut was built to guard the gate. However, one day the seal was broken and the monster that was once sealed
      off have been released again and is wreaking havoc on the world and it is up to the player to explore the dungeons
      of the world and collect parts of a magical crystal called the Abyss Gate in order to re-seal the rift.

      The gameplay consists of exploring the world and dungeons, collecting items, defeating enemies afterwards
      absorbing their souls and steal their skills and combine them with their existing skills and weapons for a
      multitude of different attacks. What makes From the Abyss different from other RPGs is that every time the player
      starts a new game, everything is randomized ensuring an unique experience each time.

      There is also multiplayer mode where two friends can play co-op and advance through the game and fight the main

      In the year 2070, a war broke out between the two nations that lasted for two years before finally peace was

      enemy mechs (known as wanzers), tanks and helicopters in a turn-based fashion, using the stylus pen to bring up
      interface menus to select units and choosing which enemy units to attack among many other options.

      There is also multiplayer capabilities using DS wireless, where players can compete head-to-head, using

      obtained through the Japanese points program, Club Nintendo. The games included are:

      Parachute: Parachuters are jumping from the helicopter into the ocean! Catch them before they fall in and get
      gobbled up by the shark!

      Octopus: Dive underwater and dodge the octopus' tentacles. Grab the treasure, but don't get too greedy!

      Parachute X Octopus: Parachute and Octopus combined into one game! Catch the parachuters, then dive underwater
      when prompted to grab the treasure. Be sure to come back up again before more parachuters start falling!

      Again, each Game &amp; Watch has both the clock and alarm function, like the original Game &amp; Watch toys.

      Nintendo Wii and Sony Playstation2 but was developed by Zen Studios. Rather than a third person chase camera
      perspective, the DS version uses a top-down perspective for most of the game. The story is the same as the other
      versions but the Ghostbusters receive side missions as well as story missions which they can use to boost the
      populace's opinion of them. Unlike the other versions in this there is no rookie character and the player takes
      control of the four original Ghostbusters one at a time while issuing commands to the other three. The money
      earned from missions can be used to buy new equipment and take part in the resource management aspect of the game.
      Also, between the game hub of the Firehouse &amp; the missions, there are driving segments which uses a chase
      camera perspective where the player takes Ecto-1 from location to location, catching ghosts along the way.</story>

    <story>Giana Sisters DS is a modern 2009 remake of the cult game The Great Giana Sisters from the year 1987. The
      original game appeared on the C64 and Amiga, but had to be pulled from the shelves after Nintendo threatened to
      sue over similarities to the Super Mario games. Surprisingly, more than 20 years later the sisters make an
      appearance on the Nintendo DS.

      Giana Sisters DS is a classic platformer. Giana is caught in a dream world and must now recover her lost diamonds
      and find a way to the mysterious castle. The game features more than 80 new levels (i.e. is not a one-to-one
      remake). There are also new special items that make use of the features of the DS. Giana can, for example, collect
      a bubble gum item that can be activated using the touch screen. The bubble enables Giana to fly and is controlled
      by blowing into the microphone. Another new feature is a world map that allows the player to select and replay
      levels.</story>

    <story>Glory Days 2 takes the premise of Choplifter! and cranks it up a few notches. A strategic component was added
      that melds old gameplay with new game concepts. There are a lot of playable vehicles that become unlocked as you
      advance in the game.

      The overall goal of the game is to provide air support for your ground troops as they advance and capture enemy
      bunkers, ultimately pushing them back enough that they retreat. Players can choose from three aviators and there
      are sixteen missions in total, moving on in time from classic WWII aircraft to modern day helicopters and F14's.

      The strategical component allows the player to take command of ground units and manage funds to build new units.
      These funds are acquired by completing missions such as saving civilians or capturing bases. Progressively, more
      powerful units and weapons become available. Multiplayer is supported for up to eight players over Wi-Fi, split
      into two cooperative teams where the enemy's command centre needs to be taken out. The setup of the battles is
      completely customizable for different parameters.

      Optionally, 3D glasses are supported to add more depth to the action on the screens.</story>

      never ending battle is going on between vast armies inspired by the elemental forces of nature. The books
      eventually land at the feet of Magmion, the evil Lava Gormiti. Magmion reads the book and learns of an old legend
      which talks about reuniting five sacred amulets which have been scattered across Gorm. Once reunited these amulets
      allow the holder to open an inter-dimensional portal to Earth! The Lords of Nature need to use all their unique
      powers to hinder Magmion's plans and save Earth. The game recreates the beautifully illustrated island of Gorm,
      where the Lords of Earth, Sea, Air and Forest are charged with stopping the evil Magmion from wreaking havoc.

      buttons to hit the notes.

      The game does boast some good quality cover songs such as Girlfriend, Underclass Hero, In the Shadow, Beat It,

    <story>Following the tradition of the Petz series for PC, Ubisoft brings now the series to the DS. This time with
      hamsters.

      Like in other games of the series for the DS, the player has to care for his/her pet by feeding it, bathing it,
      brushing it and other such tasks. There are five different breeds to choose from and seven mini-games that
      randomly appear to give you food, costumes, toys and items for the cage where the hamsters live. And thanks to the
      wireless connection to other DSs, hamsters and other items can be shared with friends. The player can even store
      information on up to other 20 different owners.

      Due to its Japanese origin, there are plenty of anime art elements in the game, for instance, and many other
      Japanese oddities like the possibility to teach your hamster to talk or store the blood type of other players. In
      addition, in Hamsterz the main goal is to raise your hamster in order for him to make itself a complete
      "Ham-country" (sic.), where it can build plenty of buildings like a school, a bakery, etc., making this the game
      of the series where the pet can behave closest to an actual human.</story>

    <story>Take on the role of Harry, Ron and Hermione as they begin their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
      and Wizardry. This year, the Triwizard Tournament takes place, and Harry is mysteriously entered into the
      tournament himself.

      Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance is a top-down action/adventure game
      where you play as the three friends and progress through the story based on the book and film.

      Make your way through various scenarios by attacking enemies and solving puzzles using spells. One button fires a
      ranged spell, such as Confoundus, while another is used for stream spells, like Wingardium Leviosa, which can be
      moved around with the Control Pad. You can also call your friends for added power to your magical spells.

      The DS version includes a small bonus game where you take care of a magical creature called a 'Niffler'. It is a
      simulation game, like a very simple Tamagotchi. You can feed the Niffler, clean it, and give it toys - depending
      on what you do, it will become more or less pleased with you. Perform well enough, and it will become really
      happy, and let you pat it to make it even happier.</story>

    <story>Hello Pocoyo! is the first console game based on Pocoyo, the award winning animated series created and
      developed by Zinkia.

      The story takes place when Pocoyo, a curious, fun-loving and friendly little boy, makes disappear all his friends
      using a magic marker. Pocoyo will travel through the desert, the space, the forest and the rest of scenery's of
      the series until finding all of them.

      The game is a graphical adventure specially designed for players from 6 years old. Puzzles require some creative
      thinking but also a little bit of skill from time to time. Everything is placed in the world to make the player
      feel he is involved in an adventure in which his teammates are Pocoyo and the rest of the characters.

      Players will have to use his memory and musical skills, color lots of paintings, use a magnifying glass to
      decipher images, blow to the microphone to make characters fly using a balloon… Besides, the player will take
      control of Pato, Elly and Loula, who will be joining the troupe as the player and Pocoyo find them. Each of these
      characters have some unique abilities that will be needed in certain parts of the game.

      Hello Pocoyo! includes a contextual help system to prevent players getting stuck. Also, the amount of text used in
      the game is minimal, since the main part of the story is told with pre-rendered cinematics, the voice over of the
      narrator of the series, and lots of pictures and images spread around the levels of the game.</story>

    <story>Poppycock! When the number one pompous adventurer, Henry Hatsworth, discovers a golden hat deep in the
      jungle, it makes him twenty years younger - but it also unleashes another world, releasing hordes of nasty
      monsters! To top it off, the number two pompous adventurer, Weaselby, is one step ahead of Hatsworth - eager to
      snag up the remaining pieces of the Golden Suit and claim the number one position in the Pompous Adventurer's Club
      for himself! Who can grab the suit, put Weaselby in his place, and seal up the other world, all before Tea Time?
      Why, Henry Hatsworth, of course!

      Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure is a hybrid of two styles of game - the top screen has an
      action-platformer starring Hatsworth, who must defeat enemies with his sword. When he does, they fall down into
      the Puzzle Realm on the Touch Screen, which plays like Tetris Attack. Players must match the block enemies up with
      other colored blocks to finally destroy them, before they rise up back to the top screen to harass Hatsworth once
      again.

      Henry also has access to a super meter - by clearing blocks in the Puzzle Realm, he fills it up. If he fills it up
      enough, it's Tea Time! This means that Hatsworth can transform into superpowered steampunk robot that shoots
      lasers and missiles and is completely invulnerable, which is handy when the player is in a jam.</story>

    <story>Heroes of Mana is a continuation of Square Enix's, World of Mana series, but with a new twist in the
      gameplay. This time around the gameplay is now real-time, where players can build bases and their own armies
      consisting of humans, monsters and rabites throughout the Mana series.

      The story takes place when a witch by the name of Anise brought darkness to the land, unleashing hordes of
      monsters on the world. She is eventually defeated by the guardians of the trees, but the evil she unleashed was
      unable to me stopped until the Mana Goddess uses the Mana Sword to seal off the darkness in eight stones, bringing
      peace to the world. This is where the players takes control of the main protagonist, Roget, a younger warrior who
      has learned that somehow the evil is coming back into the world and must embark on a quest with 10 other comrades
      and countless created units and stop the evil forces from being unleashed again.

      The player uses the stylus mostly throughout the game, touching on a certain character and touching somewhere on
      the screen to move them around or draw circles around multi characters to move them all at once. Players do battle
      by selecting their unit and tapping enemy units with the stylus to use that units attack skill on that selected
      enemy. Players can also build building and units to help them out by gathering two resources throughout the game,
      Gaia (which is responsible for buildings) and Treant (for units) all of which is located in the players main base,
      a large ship. Each unit has a different skill, some are good against enemy units others are used for resource
      gathering.

      Friends can also compete through Wi-Fi head-to-head as well as see their ranking against other players. Players
      can also earn bonus items and maps through this if their ranking is high enough. The music is also composed by
      Yoko Shimomura who is also responsible for music in games such as Kingdom Hearts, Legend of Mana and Super Mario
      RPG as well.</story>

      In Horsez the player plays Ginger, a young girl that receives a pony from a friend that leaves the country. Horsez
      is one of the Petz games that focuses mainly on training your pet in order to participate in competitions. As
      usual, there is also caring tasks like feeding, bathing, brushing, etc. so the pony grows healthy and strong, but
      the final goal will still be to train your horse in cross, jump and dressage and win at horse sport events
      worldwide. Other traditional elements of the series, like dressing your horse and Ginger for exhibition purposes
      or even toys when the player still owns a foal, also appear in Horsez.

      As for the wireless gameplay, in addition to the usual sharing of pets with other game owners, there is also the

    <story>In Hotel Giant DS the player is responsible for managing a hotel. In principle the game is played similar to
      Hotel Giant 2 but adjusted to the capabilities of the platform. The first big difference is that there is no
      classic free playing mode but only 15 missions where the player needs to reach certain goals. Mostly the player
      takes over a half-finished hotel and needs to finish furnishing the rooms. The available items were reduced to the
      most necessary.

      When the hotel opens its doors the most time is spent with attending to the cusomer's complaints. After beating a
      mission it can be played again with self-determined goals. The game is played in real-time but can be paused at
      any time. A save option is available after every day. There is also a mini game when the player doesn't want to
      hire cleaners: troubles are indicated with a flash on the mini map. When clicking on it the player needs to make a

    <story>I Spy Fun House is another digital adaptation of the long-running series of children's books by Walter Wick,
      this time with an amusement park theme. The objective is to find and click on all the objects described in a verse
      at the bottom, on screens depicting locations and attractions of the park. The objects move or display a little
      animation after being clicked to indicate the correct selection. After all the required items are found, the verse
      is replaced with a final clue to a hidden ticket.

      The tickets unlock new areas and mini-games. Eleven tickets are necessary to enter the Fun House area, while extra
      tickets open the mini-games. These bonus games are implementations of classic concepts, where the player has to
      match tiles by swapping pairs on concentric circles, fit tetrominoes shapes inside the limited space of a box,
      click on the differences between several similar pictures and other challenges. There are no hints or hint button
      available to show the location of the objects, and no time limit or penalty for wrong clicks.

      The Windows/Macintosh CD-ROM release includes a 3-inch promotional mini-disc, containing one riddle from each of
      three earlier I Spy games: I Spy Fantasy, I Spy Spooky Mansion Deluxe, and I Spy Treasure Hunt.</story>

    <story>In six hours the evil Professor Elvin Atombender's nuclear missiles will launch and destroy strategic
      locations on the earth. Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission.

      The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender's Control Room in time
      to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four
      pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that
      Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten
      minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop
      them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few
      seconds.

      The 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and
      make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities.
      Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock,
      blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching
      or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms
      which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a
      "mixed" mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical
      upgrades.</story>

    <story>Inazuma Eleven is a blend of a football (soccer) game and traditional RPG. The game stars Mark Evans, the
      captain and goalkeeper of Raimon Junior High School's football team. However, it seems that he is the only one who
      cares about playing as his teammates prefer to waste time in the clubroom. Because of that their club is the
      laughing stock of the whole school and on the verge of being disbanded. The team is given one last chance in
      winning a friendly match against one of the best teams. When all seems lost, there appears a transfer student and
      well-known player ? Axel Blaze. The team now has hopes for winning, but there are others that, for some reason,
      don't want the club to exist.

      The game is divided into classic top-down exploration, during which the player walks around and interacts with
      NPCs, and real-time football matches. The matches play out in real-time and are controlled only with the stylus.
      All of the teammates on the field move automatically with the player being able to manually draw or point to their
      destination. Encountering a rival or enemy goal, the game pauses and the player is able to choose his action.
      These consist of standard moves and anime-styled supernatural skills.

      As in any RPG, teammates gain levels and improve their statistics, which affect the way they perform and the
      outcome of their actions. The team is fully customizable with your teammates' position on the field and hundreds
      additional players among whom to recruit new ones from.</story>

    <story>Inazuma Eleven 2: Firestorm is a role-playing sports game that was released for Nintendo DS at the same time
      as the game Inazuma Eleven 2: Blizzard in Europe and Japan.

      In this game you play as a football keeper, who plays for his school football team, winner of the last Football
      Frontier. However, an alien football team, the Gemini Storm, wants to destroy all the schools. So, as the player
      one starts going around all through Japan to look for new players to beat the Gemini Storm in a football match.
      When one reaches the city of Nara, you find out that the Prime Minister was kidnapped, and you'll have to face a
      football match with a team of undercover agents to save said Prime Minister. Afterward, when traveling to the city
      of Alpine, you will find the character Shawn Froste, who will help you in defeating the Gemini Storm.

      In the game you take control of Mark, the football keeper, in the overworld, where you can collect items,
      improving yourself with training or taking part in random encounters. On the Inazuma Bus, you can recruit players
      for your team, restore your FP (Fitness Points) and TP (Technical Points), or travel to the different regions of
      Japan.
      The matches are controlled with the stylus, and when you run into an opposing player, you start a duel which
      determines the possession of the ball. You can also use special abilities.</story>

    <story>Growing up as a second class citizen on a back-water planet, Yuri dreamed of being able to travel the stars.
      After many years he saved up enough credits to buy transport off the planet, but space travel is forbidden to
      second class citizens, and he is chased by the security forces of the corrupt owner of the planet. To survive the
      dangers of space Yuri must become a captain, buy and customize star ships, and fight against hostile enemies both
      on the ground and in space.

      The majority of Infinite Space's gameplay involves space ships, both in fighting and in modifying. All ships have
      a certain amount of space for extra modules to be added, and the abilities and shape of modules must be considered
      when choosing how to outfit a ship. In ship to ship combat you can control the distance your fleet is from the
      enemy fleet. During combat a command bar charges. You can use a small amount of the command bar to Dodge, use more
      to fire a Normal salvo, or expend almost all of it for a Barrage, which fires three times as many shots as Normal.
      If the opposing fleet uses Dodge before a Barrage then every shot will miss, leaving the attacking fleet at a
      disadvantage. If a Normal salvo is fired while the opposing fleet is Dodging, then every shot will hit and deal
      extra damage. Extra combat options come into play with larger star ships equipped with fighter hangars, special
      weapons, boarding parties, and officers with unique abilities.

      The story progresses primarily with text dialogue and the occasional FMV. Sometimes the player is prompted to make
      a decision in dialogue for Yuri, and these decisions can have far reaching consequences. Additional officers can
      join Yuri through the story, by hiring them at a mercenary office, or by finding them on various planets. All
      officers have unique stats and abilities that make them better for a particular role, such as doctor, engineer, or
      pilot, than others, and these stats and abilities increase in level from combat.</story>

    <story>Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven
      different platforms. The NDS version, by A2M, is the most different one.

      The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius
      inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor
      instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them
      back.

      The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through 8 different missions, divided in by
      air and by foot missions, and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man.
      All this is shown through images between every mission, which use the voices of the actors of the movie like
      Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.

      As for the game mechanics, by foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red
      and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of
      soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles,
      micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful "Unibeam". Both the weapons and the
      suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable using the points that each mission regards you.

      In the handling section, the next approach is used: move with a given set of controls, aim with another. In
      addition, there is also a button for repulsors (extra propulsion) to fly faster. The NDS touchscreen is used for
      aiming 360-wise, touching in a given direction from the center of the screen, and the pad is used for moving.

      game, with War Machine able to use the touchscreen to blast foes from every angle, and Iron Man able to nimbly
      outmaneuver foes and use numerous weapon systems against mechanized opponents.

    <story>Jam Sessions is a reworked and localized version of the Japan-only DS title Hiite Utaeru DS Guitar M-06. It
      is a rhythm/music game, but rather than only offering musical challenges like other games in the genre, it can
      also be used as a tool - a pocket guitar. Simulating a guitar, the game part allows players to go through a list
      of famous songs. The chords are selected on the D-pad while the stylus is used to simulate strumming on the
      screen. Alternately, the L-button can be used to strum. The details are worked out thoroughly - speed and power
      change the sound, and downstrokes sound different from upstrokes. With only one strum string shown, only chord
      progression can be performed and no individual riffing or picking. The game does not punish players for not doing
      well, songs just keep on going regardless of the player's performance. There is a tutorial and warm up mode to get
      familiar with the controls.

      As a tool, it allows players to compose their own songs and add a variety of effects. These include distortion,
      low cut, high cut, delay, chorus and flanger with extensive settings for each of them. These can be set invariably
      or made touch-specific. When using headphones or external speakers, the DS microphone can be used to sing along.
      Additionally, the DS can be plugged in to an amplifier via the headphone jack to output a more natural sound. A US
      re-release include a mini-amp in the package. Instead of using a stylus, pick-shaped variants were also made
      available.

      In the top screen, players can add a metronome, guide bars and tab guides, along with different backgrounds and
      templates. Up to five different compositions can be saved.</story>

    <story>Jenga World Tour is a take off of the popular board game in which you take blocks from the lower part of a
      block tower and set it on top without toppling it. The premise is the same for the video game, using the Wii
      remote, you pull the blocks while moving the remote and using "A" button while using the "B" button to tap them
      out gently to keep the stack from toppling over.

      There are several different backgrounds (in the pit of a volcano, medieval England, underwater, prehistoric times
      or even the Himalayan Mountain) you can play in, each having their own special differences, such as blocks
      freezing in the Himalayan stage or only being able to hold onto hot blocks in the volcano for a limited time or
      even avoiding catapults in the England stage.

      There is also an arcade mode where you play a continuous game of Jenga or you can play against a friend in
      multi-player mode. The Nintendo DS runs along similar lines, using the stylus pen to pull out and tap blocks out
      of place, but doesn't have the same levels as the Wii version, but does have the same kind of effects (i.e. ice
      blocks, cement blocks and even UFO attacks). You can also play against a friend using Wi-Fi.</story>

      the limited screen size of the handheld, the grid size of the levels had to be cut down from 14x14 to 12x12 tiles,
      thus forcing a complete redesign of all the levels. While at it the developers added some DS-only gameplay options
      like the new magical storm where the player can blow into the microphone to reshuffle the jewels.

      The basic idea of Jewel Match comes from Bejeweled / Diamond Mine - the player is presented with a grid of jewels.
      By swapping pairs of tiles which are next to each other, rows of three or more identical jewels can be formed that
      will disappear instantly, giving points to the player and making room for other gems falling from above to take
      their place. The levels have gaps and shaped areas, though, so pieces do not simply fall vertically but also can
      fall diagonally.

      Jewel Match has its own victory criterion though. On each of the 150 levels, a selection of squares have gold or
      even silver backings. One match (gold) or two (silver) must be created over each of these against a ticking clock
      to clear the level. Later in the game there are jewels tied to their square with a golden or silver chain, which
      thus are not falling down and blocking empty squares beneath them. These jewels can be freed by matching them once
      or twice, too, which means that the most difficult squares must be matched four times (silver chain and silver
      background) to be cleared.

      A succession of hammers are unlocked once you have scored a certain amount of points. The first removes a
      particular jewel, the second not only removes the gem but also any effects (background or chains) on the square,
      and the final one removes all gems of that colour. Another extra to be unlocked is a magical storm that will have
      the player blow into the DS microphone to mix up the jewels. Moreover, matching more than three jewels in a row
      will create gems with special powers. Matching four will create a joker gem while matching five gives a gem that,
      once activated, will destroy the whole row it is in.

      The game also offers a hot seat mode where two players can play the same level right after another, competing for
      the better clearing time.</story>

    <story>Jump Ultimate Stars is more or less an expanded version of the original game, Jump Super Stars. It features
      the same Super Smash Bros.-style fighting gameplay with a plethora of licensed manga characters, bringing in a
      wide variety of new franchises and characters. The roster has been expanded to more than 300 characters from 41
      different manga titles. There is also Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection support, making global internet play a
      possibility.

      Generally, the game is structured the same as the previous title. The player sets up decks made up of the three
      types of panels, which can be used on the fly with the touchscreen. There is a story mode, versus modes, several
      single-player modes, as well as a quiz mode and information archives and story synopses for each series. The
      method of obtaining new panels has changed, however: each character has a progress tree, and successful battles
      earn gems which can be spent to power up different characters.

      The complete list of series represented is: Eyeshield 21, I''s, Ichigo 100%, Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, Captain
      Tsubasa, Gintama, Kinnikuman, Kochi Kame, Cobra, Sakigake!! Otoko Juku, Jigoku Sensei Nube, Shaman King, Jungle no

      It takes a different approach to the formula, by delivering information in smaller sessions, making it easier to

      Unlockable games include:

      1. Ghosts - use the stylus to touch a ghost and capture it. As many as possible must be caught within the time
      limit.

      2. Twins - a memory game requiring pairs of people to be matched up against a time limit.

      3. Snakes - a game of skill and timing that requires a snake to be guided around the screen to collect coloured
      sweets.

      4. Football – the stylus is used to move a football boot across the screen kicking a ball against the wall to
      remove bricks.

      5. Beggar My Neighbour – tap on a pile of playing cards with the stylus to play a move against the console.
      Whoever has the highest card wins the hand.

    <story>The DS version on Justice League Heroes, while not following the plot of its console brethren, has a similar
      premise where you play as a member of the titular super-hero team and travel to a number of locations where hordes
      of enemies run amok.

      The game is played with a top-down view of the environment on the lower screen and a map on top. The map displays
      the location of your next checkpoint and the positions of the enemies along with the status of your characters.
      The lower screen, in addition to the action, has various function icons that can be activated with the stylus.

      There are about a dozen missions broken into about forty sections. Before each, you must pick two heroes from the
      line-up of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Flash. Each has regular melee attacks, strong melee attacks, a
      ranged attack and a unique super-power move. They must use these abilities to defeat many enemies and move to the
      next checkpoint, completing objectives such as switch-flipping and item collection along the way. You may swap
      between your two heroes at any time by tapping an icon on the screen. Another icon lets you call in an
      AI-controlled hero for brief support. There are six of these to choose from: Martian Manhunter, Zatanna, Green
      Lantern, Aquaman, Green Arrow and Huntress. Each of these has a unique ability based on their powers.

      In addition to the main game, there are two minigames and a third can be unlocked by inserting Justice League
      Heroes: The Flash into the GBA slot.</story>

    <story>Ce jeu présente deux histoires de J.B. Harold, détective privé. Les deux histoires sont chacune une version
      alternative, qui commence et se développe différemment les unes des autres, tout en laissant des caractères et des
      lieux communs. Un peu comme jouer à J.B. Harold dans deux réalités alternatives dans lesquelles l'affaire a été
      déclenchée différemment.

      Gameplay: Dans ce jeu d'aventure roman à la première personne, vous aurez plusieurs dialogues à sélectionner lors
      des interrogatoires et des conversations informelles. Le jeu comporte également une fonction de réaction faciale
      qui le rend plus facile à saisir l'état de l'esprit d'une personne à qui vous parlez. La fonction de
      journalisation arrière vous permet de parcourir facilement les dialogues que vous avez peut-être sautés trop
      rapidement ou que vous souhaitez simplement rafraîchir votre mémoire. Le jeu marque également les questions que
      vous avez à poser, ce qui vous permet de vous répéter plus tard.

      Requiem de Manhattan

      Histoire: La lettre parvient à J.B. l'informant d'un meurtre survenu dans la ville de Liberty. L'expéditeur était
      Sarah Shields. Un appel téléphonique soudain d'un ancien inspecteur Judd, qui est maintenant dans le secteur de
      l'assurance, informe J.B. d'une autre affaire de meurtre. La personne en question est Sarah Shields. Apparemment,
      elle a sauté de son appartement au 5ème étage, quelque part à Manhattan. Il n'y avait aucun témoin et aucun
      élément de preuve indiquant un jeu déloyal. Cela semble être un cas propre pour la police. Mais J.B. n'est pas
      d'accord avec cela. Il a des questions ... qu'est-ce qu'elle tenait dans sa main sur la scène du crime, quels sont
      les indices qui manquent à la police, et surtout, pourquoi voudrait-elle se suicider?

      Kiss of Murder

      Histoire: Dans la partie ouest du village de Greenwich, une jeune femme a été assassinée. Le nom de la victime
      était Sarah Shields. Elle gardait un énorme saphir qui était assuré, mais le saphir a disparut. L'enquêteur
      d'assurance Judd, qui était un ex-détective, a contacté J.B. au département du meurtre de la police de Liberty
      City et lui a demandé de l'aide pour l'affaire.</story>

    <story>Pinky Street: Kira Kira Music Hour is a music/rhythm game where you control a dancing girl by tapping your
      stylus to a series of beats in time to the music displayed on the touch screen. Gamers play the game by holding
      the Nintendo DS as though it were a book, similar to Brain Age.

      The touch screen displays the melody at the top that you must follow, and the three bars below represent the
      different note 'types' that you can play - either by tapping, or by sliding the stylus along the note (depending
      on the difficulty level). Based on the accuracy of the note press, you'll be awarded "GOOD", "KIRA²" "RAINBOW", or
      "MISS" if you fail to hit it.

      A story mode is included, where the player progresses by completing songs and unlocking new ones for play. They
      also earn money, which can be used to purchase clothes and accessories for their in-game avatar to wear. There are
      also photo booths where the avatar can pose in a variety of ways for the camera.</story>

    <story>Kirby's back with a bunch of fun adventures! Explore Dream Land and defeat King Dedede, tame the ferocious
      Dynablade, explore a huge cave, take part in a gluttonous race, vandalize Meta Knight's ship, the Halberd, explore
      the entire galaxy, and more!

      Kirby Super Star Ultra is an updated remake of Kirby Super Star, a popular SNES game which is broken up into seven
      main games. In addition to those previous games, Ultra includes five new games and three new sub-games. Listed are
      just some of the new ones:

      Revenge of the King: King Dedede wants a rematch! This game is a toughened up version of Spring Breeze, the
      opening game.

      The Arena: Every boss that Kirby has met throughout the game, one after the other! Try to beat them all!

      Meta Knightmare Ultra: Play through the first five games as Meta Knight, with his own special abilities and
      powers! Speed is the key!

      Kirby Card Swipe: Watch the top screen, and quickly pick the correct card. Be the first to do it thrice!

      Kirby on the Draw: Enemy targets pop up, tap them as they appear. Don't tap the bombs!

      Snack Tracks: Eat all the food on your tracks. Don't eat the bugs, bombs or rocks!

      As with the original, Ultra features a heavily featured multiplayer mode. All games can be played either
      co-operatively or competitively. Spring Breeze can even be played co-operatively if your friend doesn't have a
      copy of the game!</story>

    <story>A great war once raged across the land with many a valiant knight falling on the field of battle. In the end,
      the evil forces have prevailed, and have since taken over and corrupted the once great kingdom. On a stormy night
      a Wisp is awakened by a strange armored maiden. The wisp holds the memories of the war, and is now seeking all the
      valiant dead to be brought back to the world of the living in order to complete their mission and take back the
      land that was once theirs.

      Knights in the Nightmare can be loosely summed up as a Strategy RPG, but it is played like no other Strategy RPG
      in existence. The game is almost entirely stylus controlled on Nintendo DS, and combines the active-timer
      turn-based combat of a game such as Final Fantasy VI with elements of bullet-hell top-down shooters, and relies on
      a set of unorthodox rules for completion of its goals.

      Once in the field of battle the player controls the Wisp who can cause the spirits of fallen heroes inhabiting the
      area to temporarily reconstitute into their physical form and do battle with monsters that now roam the land. The
      player can recruit those warriors permanently into their party by seeking out objects that meant something to them
      while they were alive.

      The game features a robust character customization system that includes many classes of units, multiple jobs per
      each unit class, and a soul transplant system that allows the player to transfer all attributes of one player into
      another.</story>

      twelve) all double. And just as in the original version, wireless gamers can once again link as many as eight DS
      units together for multiplayer ensemble performances in which each game acts as a single instrument, and players

    <story>In this game based on the 2008 DreamWorks movie of the same name, the player is Po the panda. Po finds out
      that the best kung fu masters have been captured by the evil Tai Lung. Po is fat, loves to eat dumplings, and is
      pretty slow and clumsy at kung fu, so he is shocked when he is asked to go rescue them. Although some elements
      have been changed, the game's theme is largely identical to the movie and linear in design.

      Po's journey consists of finding the five kung fu masters, mastering a new skill that they teach him, then
      continuing on to find Tai Lung. This game is a 3rd-person side-scroller with frequent use of the touch screen and
      seems largely based on the mechanics and engine employed in the DS version of Spider-Man 3.

      Po's movements are controlled through the D-pad while attacks are performed by swiping the styles on the touch
      screen. These are also used to throw objects and perform the learned special moves. Most of the gameplay consists
      of hand to hand combat with enemies, and traversing levels by consulting your top screen mini-map. New moves are
      learned gradually and there are also small puzzle elements where Po needs to interact with the environment to
      progress.</story>

      moves against enemies alongside his friends and fellow kung fu masters, the Furious Five: Tigress, Monkey, Crane,
      Viper and Mantis. In addition, the Nintendo DS version offers an addictive card game called "Five-Card Fu," which
      can be played either alone or with a friend. The game is played on a 3x3 grid which contains nine squares. To get
      started, the player must select five cards from their in-game library and place one card in one of the nine
      squares. Each card will have a number ranging from one through nine on each side of the card. In order to win, the
      player must strategize on which square they will occupy first as well as which card to use. Once the player places
      a card in a square, the opponent will have to place a card on an adjacent square that beats the numerical value of
      the card the first player placed. The player that occupies the grid with the highest numerical value wins.</story>

    <story>Labyrinth is the sequel to a SNES game called On the Ball. The object of the game is to manipulate a ball
      through a maze to the checkered goal line. To do this, players must rotate the level around to navigate their way
      through obstacles. The ball is constantly falling towards the bottom of the screen, ignoring whatever direction
      the maze is facing.

      There are two ways to control the ball. The first is by using the L and R Shoulder buttons to rotate the maze left
      or right. The other method is to rotate the maze map on the touch screen using the stylus. Players can also
      briefly surround their ball with lightning which will shatter certain blocks. It's also possible to customize your
      ball - you can increase or decrease the weight of your ball, as well as change the colour and material it is made
      from.

      In addition to the single player mode, Labyrinth also features a Single-Cart Multiplayer mode. In this mode, up to
      four players can take part in making their way through the maze. The first player to reach the goal is the winner.

    <story>Two of gaming's all-time classics are reborn on DS. Stories tell of a land of yore, now shrouded by centuries
      of time forgotten, called Ys. Despite its great knowledge, endless wealth, and bountiful prosperity, a sudden and
      unexpected cataclysm devastated the realm. Soon, its memory had faded completely from the minds of man. Centuries
      later, a young adventurer named Adol set sail to explore the world and leave his mark on history. During his
      travels, he learned of the tragic tale of Esteria, a once prosperous island now inexplicably engulfed by a
      crippling storm. Adol plotted a course for the besieged isle, curious to unravel the mystery... Available to North
      American audiences for the first time, this ultimate translation delivers the most substantial version of the
      famous Ys story ever made. Two games in one, Ys was released separately overseas, but North American gamers get
      them together. One of the longest-running, most beloved action RPGs of all-time, Ys has features exclusive to DS
      including 3D graphics, multiplayer, touch support, and more.</story>

    <story>Continue the Wind Waker adventure in Link's first DS game.

      The epic story of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker continues as Link finds himself lost and alone in unknown
      seas in a new adventure. Featuring intuitive touch-screen controls and innovative puzzles, The Legend of Zelda:
      Phantom Hourglass offers new challenges for fans of the series and an easy-to-grasp introduction for gamers new to
      The Legend of Zelda. But time grows short, and only the Phantom Hourglass can buy Link the minutes he'll need to
      survive.

      Many months have passed since the events of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Link, Tetra and Tetra's band
      of pirates have set sail in search of new lands. They come across a patch of ocean covered in a dense fog, in
      which they discover an abandoned ship. Tetra falls into danger when she explores the ship alone, and Link falls
      into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her. When he washes up unconscious on the shores of a mysterious island,
      he is awakened by the sound of a fairy's voice. With the aid of this fairy, he sets off to find Tetra and his way

      ? Wield weapons and solve puzzles, all with your stylus

      ? Duke it out with friends in multiplayer battle mode

      ? Link and Zelda adventure together for the first time

      The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks sets hero Link on a daring new adventure. The game provides players with a new
      story, more puzzles and even a new mode of transportation. In this game, Link voyages by train, which offers up
      new possibilities for problem-solving. The game has the same look and feel established in the hit Nintendo DS game
      The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.

      ? Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he?s accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of
      armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the
      touchscreen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to
      carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm.

      ? When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as
      they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the
      best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard
      cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks.

      ? Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into
      the microphone of the Nintendo DS system.

      ? As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on
      the touch screen.</story>

      Story Mode levels, including Episode II's newly added high-speed pursuit of bounty hunter Zam Wessell. Traveller's

    <story>The handheld Nintendo versions of LEGO The Lord of the Rings (based on Peter Jackson's film trilogy, and in
      turn based on J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books) follow the same storyline as its home console cousins, where players
      must help Frodo Baggins and his friends travel from their peaceful home in the Shire to the perilous Mount Doom to
      destroy a powerful ring created by the antagonistic Sauron.

      Like various LEGO games, players control a variety of characters using the control pad (as well as the 3DS Circle
      Pad) across several levels in an open-world environment, completing a set of quests along the way. Players also
      need to utilise special items like the Light of Eärendil, Elven rope and a wide arrange of weaponry to defeat
      several enemies (especially in the dark region of Mordor).

      Unlike previous LEGO games, character biographies are also scattered throughout the levels that give players
      general summaries for each unique character. Red Bricks are also scattered and can unlock special abilities with
      the Extras menu.

      While the slapstick humour is absent in these games, the 3DS and DS versions still retain the family-friendly
      approach as the home console versions.</story>

    <story>Fairy Tale Land faces its greatest crisis yet! A plague has swept through the population, turning former
      upstanding citizens into blood-crazed zombies.

      Fortunately, the world's greatest adventurer and weapons collector, Little Red 'Ready To Rock' Riding Hood is
      still unaffected and is determined to uncover the source of the disease. She teams up with Momotaro, the boy who
      emerged from a peach in the Japanese folk tale, and the two set out on their quest. Red has her trusty machine gun
      and Momotaro has his ninja stars. They'll take down anything, living or dead, that gets in their way.

      Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ is a classic, arcade-style vertical shooter for one player. The action is
      viewed from a high angle, with visuals taking up both screens of the DS. The game world is presented in 3D, as are
      bosses and various other enemies. However, the main character and standard zombies are 2D sprites.

      The player's character (either Red or Momotaro, neither of whom has any obvious advantage over the other) is
      situated at the bottom of the lower screen and waves of zombies march toward her/him. The character automatically
      moves forward through the world, but the player can control left/right movement along a 2D plane, enabling them to
      move out of the way of obstacles, projectiles and zombies.
      Touching the stylus to any point on the screen causes the character to shoot in that direction, and shots can be
      fired along the entire length of the play area (i.e. to targets at the top of the DS's upper screen).
      The standard machine gun has infinite ammo, but must be reloaded, which simply means taking the stylus off the
      screen for a second. Along the way, there are other weapons to pick up - a shotgun, laser rifle and flamethrower
      (hence the 'BBQ' of the title). These special weapons have limited ammo, so must be conserved.
      Players also start with a grenade launcher, which can be launched by double-tapping an area on the screen. Ammo is
      strictly limited, but can be replenished.

      There are 21 levels, split over seven chapters. Each chapter is set in a different location based on a fairy tale
      or classic story and consists of two regular levels (fighting through hordes of zombies, as well as some
      mini-bosses) followed by a boss fight.

      The boss fights are one of the game's main selling points, with varied and lengthy encounters against twisted,
      undead versions of Pinocchio, The Three Little Pigs, Santa Claus and others.

      By completing the game on higher difficulty levels, new gameplay modes can be unlocked, including Boss Attack
      (defeat every boss in sequence) and Survival (timed battle against waves of zombies).</story>

    <story>Lock's Quest is a strategy / action / adventure game, for the Nintendo DS, that follows the adventurous life
      of a young "Archineer" named Lock (An Archineer is a mix between an architect and an engineer). Lock's village is
      attacked by an enemy known as the "Clockwork." During the invasion, the story is set in motion when Lock's little
      sister, Emi, goes missing. Lock, his new friend Isaiah, and Lock's grandfather Tobias set out in search for Emi.
      Along the way, Lock joins the Archineers and Kingdom Force in hopes of defeating the Clockwork army and their
      leader Lord Agony.

      The game play consists of two main modes of play: "Build Mode" and "Battle Mode." In Build Mode, the player has a
      limited amount of time to build defenses that will stand up against the approaching Clockwork army. Each defensive
      object costs a certain amount of "Source" (the game's currency). Many levels have protection objectives that the
      player must defend and prevent from being destroyed by the Clockwork. The player can build walls and gates of
      various material types (Wood, Stone, Metal and Spiked), unique "Turrets" that automatically fire at approaching
      enemies, "Traps" that can be placed in the battlefield and stationary "Helpers" that give nearby turrets specific
      buffs. Each player can develop a personal strategy that best fits his play-style based off of the current terrain
      and his choice of defences. New abilities, enemies and areas are constantly unlocked as the player progresses
      through the entire game.

      Battle Mode begins when the Build Mode timer runs out, or when the player chooses to advance to the battle. The
      player is thrown into a real time battle and must defend the protection objectives for a certain amount of time
      while holding off the attack. Other objectives include: destroying specific groups of enemies, capturing enemy
      objectives, rescuing friendly characters and destroying boss enemies. The battles involve controlling Lock
      directly with the Stylus as the enemies attack. The player may engage the Clockwork enemies in mêlée combat. Doing
      so brings up various mini games which can increase Lock's attack damage or add a status effect, such as poison, to
      the Clockwork. Lock may also repair walls and turrets which have been damaged. This also brings up a mini game
      where the player must use the stylus in a back and forth "ratcheting" motion to fix the wall. Not only is the
      player able to control Lock directly, but he can move the camera independently from the character. This control
      scheme allows flexibility for the player to focus on repairing or attacking in one area, while looking at what's
      going on in another area.

      Lock's Quest is broken into 100 Build and Battle phases called "Days," covering a wide variety of areas and
      scenarios. The story is advanced through interactive free roam areas, villages and cinematic cut scenes which take
      place in between the battles. Plot twists and character development becomes the vehicle for pushing the game
      forward after the initial game play techniques are taught in an interactive tutorial. A multiplayer feature is
      also present in Lock's Quest using the wireless DS multi-card play. In this mode, two players compete head to head
      in a mix of Build and Battle modes where the players can choose the paths and type of clockworks their opponent
      will face.</story>

    <story>Luminous Arc is a strategy role-playing game.

      The story is set in a world in which there are two groups in apparent opposition: the Luminous church, and the
      witches.

      During the course of the story, the player controls a party made up of orphans who have been raised by the
      Luminous church. They are called the Garden Children, and are tasked with the condemnation of witches. However,
      soon after the beginning of the story, it becomes evident that things are not as clear-cut as they initially seem.

      Structurally, the party moves from area to area, and the plot advances as the player progresses through battles.
      Equipment may be powered up through the use of a vitae forging system. Also, relationships with characters may be
      strengthened during post-fight "intermissions," leading to some bonuses in future battles.</story>

    <story>Many years into the future, a race of vampires have emerged, plunging planet Earth into darkness with an
      environmental control system called the 'paraSOL'. They now control the planet, with humans living in fear. When
      all hope seems lost, two boys with amazing power emerge to save the planet. The Dark Swordsman, Lucian, and a
      rookie member of the vampire fighting 'Guild', Aaron.

      Lunar Knights is an indirect sequel to the Boktai series of games, which takes place many years after. Its focus
      is much more on action as opposed to stealth, although some stealth elements from the earlier games remain (for
      example, you can blow into the microphone to whistle and attract the attention of enemies). Players control the
      two characters, Lucian and Aaron. Lucian fights with a huge sword called 'Vanagand'. As a result, Lucian has a
      close combat style. Lucian uses the power of moonlight to fuel his special attacks and moves.

      The other character is Aaron, a gunslinger for the Guild. He fights by using sunlight to charge up his gun, the
      Knight, and shoot ranged shots at foes. Aaron's special attacks and moves use up sunlight. Both Aaron and Lucian
      can use junk materials to increase the level of their weaponry, giving them more power.

      The main goal of the game is to make your way through the dungeons and purify the vampire at the end. The dungeons
      themselves are fairly standard - you search for treasure chests, avoid traps and solve puzzles. At the end, you'll
      fight a boss vampire, and once you've defeated them, the Casket Rocket will be called. Because the vampires have
      blocked out the sun on Earth, you'll need to take the vampire into space to purify them.

      At this point, the game becomes a touch screen controlled shooter. To control the ship itself, you drag it around
      the screen with the stylus. To shoot enemy ships, you tap them with the screen. Once you reach the end, the
      vampire will be purified by the magnified power of the sun.</story>

    <story>Madagascar Kartz is a racing game based on DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar. It was released on October 27,
      2009 and the second game on Madagascar's spin-off series.

      Gameplay[edit]
      The game is a basic kart racing game, and the player can perform jumps, flips, rolls.[1] There are many different
      stages from scenes of the franchise.[1] Playable characters include Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, King Julien,
      Mason and Phil, or all four of the penguins.[1] The Madagascar Kartz Wheel is bundled with the Wii version of the
      game. This wheel is optional. This wheel's look is different from that of the Wii Wheel from Mario Kart Wii.[1]

      Playable characters include Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, Gloria the Hippotamus, The
      Penguins, The Chimps, and King Julien from the Madagascar. Two characters from other movies are included alongside
      the Madagascar, Shrek from Shrek, and B.O.B. from Monsters vs. Aliens, all DreamWorks Animation franchises. Race
      types include Quick Race, Championship, Time Trial and Checkpoint race. A Championship race is one where the
      player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc,
      150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial,
      players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as
      many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out. There are several tracks in the game. Also, in a track,
      most tracks have 2 shortcuts. "I Like to Move It", sung by Reel 2 Real, is the menu theme. The game's gameplay is
      similar to those of Mario Kart Wii, by Nintendo. The sequel is Super Star Kartz.</story>

    <story>Magical Starsign is Role Playing Game about a group of students at the Will O’ Wisp magical academy. When
      their teacher mysteriously disappears they set out to find and rescue her. As she is on a different planet, this
      involves space travel. The player starts out alone, but one by one the classmates join the quest.

      The students are each specialized in a different art of magic, linked to a starsign. As the planets move through
      the sky (as seen on the 'astrolog') the magic associated with that sign grows stronger and weaker. This applies to
      the monsters as well, which adds a strategic element to the gameplay.

      As characters grow stronger, they learn new spells. During combat, players tap on the attacks they want to use and
      then tap on an enemy to target. By tapping the character's head at the exact moment they release the spell, the
      attack is extra effective.

      There are two multiplayer options. The first, tag mode, allows players to exchange data with one another. In the
      magical rocket, an egg will hatch that will slowly develop into a new unique character. In the amigo dungeon mode
      up to six people can explore an 'amigo dungeon'.</story>

    <story>Playing with balls is fun! Magnetica is a fiendish action puzzler game from Japanese developer Mitchell
      Corporation, and the sequel to the 1998 arcade game Puzz Loop. Marbles will relentlessly roll across twisted
      tracks and into a hole in its center. When three same-coloured marbles touch each other, they destroy themselves.
      With the DS Stylus, players must shoot same-coloured marbles into the oncoming rows in order to prevent them from
      falling down the hole and thus clear a track. The twist is that now, marbles that share the same color will
      attract each other!

      Magnetica takes advantage of the Nintendo DS hardware for precise touch-screen functionality and brings a new play
      mechanic to the famous puzzle. Test your ball-shooting skills in Challenge Mode, Puzzle Mode, Quest Mode and more.

    <story>Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, this game follows the story of the emperor penguins as they
      embark on a long journey to breed their young. The game has been divided into twelve chapters, with different
      gameplay. The penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate, find food, take care of
      the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all the way back.

      A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players need to help them
      land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides,
      bridges and steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars and the penguins need
      to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they
      simply restart at the beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a group to
      succeed.

      Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place underwater
      where predators need to be avoided while collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds
      an new layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There is little time to pick it
      up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a warm spot before the thermometer time runs out.

      Some educational content has also been included. Next to the habits, more information about the penguin migration
      in provided in between levels.</story>

    <story>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 shrinks the console game to fit on Nintendo's handheld. It is still in 3D and
      played on the upper screen. The lower screen is used to switch characters and use the star meter.

      As with other versions, you play a squad of four characters at a time. You can switch between them at any time.
      There are shield points throughout the game where you can save and swap out characters.

      Defeating enemies builds up a star meter. You can spend two stars to resurrect a fallen ally or all five to
      perform a powerful fusion attack where two characters combine their powers. Any pair of characters has their own
      unique fusion.

      Defeating enemies also builds experience, which causes your characters to level up, increasing their powers and
      stats. Each character has four active and two passive powers and you can distribute the points however you wish or
      let the computer do it for you. Points can be reassigned at any time.

      The story is told through 2-D cutscenes staged in the style of cardboard cutouts. It combines the Secret War and
      Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury uses superheroes in an unauthorized attack on Latveria,
      public sentiment turns against them. Then, after more than six hundred people are accidentally killed in a super
      hero fight, Congress passes the Super Human Registration Act, mandating all powered individual reveal their
      identity to the government. The game has you pick a pro or anti registration side. The beginning and end of the
      game are the same either way, but the middle section is different depending on which side you choose. The levels
      are mostly the same, but have different objectives. Several characters are restricted to each side and locked out
      if you play the other.</story>

      Upper Deck. It includes cards from all of the Marvel-based Vs. sets through the X-Men set.

      The gameplay involves head-to-head battles where players recruit superhero characters with various strengths and
      powers onto the playfield. Each character has a basic Attack and Defense value which determines the outcome of
      individual character battles. This basic mechanic is augmented by character powers, Equipment cards (which give
      the character additional powers/stats), Location cards (which affect multiple cards or game rules while they are
      face up), and Plot Twist cards (which are often played to change the outcome of individual character battles by
      boosting Attack or Defense values).

      The game features two single player campaigns, tutorials, puzzles, and an online mode similar to Magic The
      Gathering Online. The online mode supports cross-platform play between the PC and PSP versions.</story>

      Magic Show and Magic Training.

      In Solo Magic, a magician performs parlor tricks such as guessing what card the player has just picked out or
      guessing by the hand gestures the player makes over the DS screen.

      In Magic Tricks, there are fourteen different tricks to try where the game is more of an assistant, helping the
      player out performing your tricks including having a friend pick out a card and drawing a face at the bottom of
      the screen that will guess the card picked out. It can also guess a person's birthday or where they are going on
      their vacation. Some of the tricks have the player recite different things through the microphone, for instance
      the vacation trick, or the player needs to blow into the microphone.

      The third mode is called Magic Training, which is more of a series of mini-games to help test reaction speed.
      There are step by step instructions of how to perform tricks and there is also a special deck of cards that comes
      with the game.</story>

    <story>Master of the Monster Lair is a dungeon crawling RPG with a different twist, whereas in previous dungeon
      crawlers the objective is to find the dungeons and monsters to clear them, the player creates the dungeon (or a
      monster lair in this case) in order to attract the monster and trap it to destroy it. There are 23 different rooms
      to customize for the player's Monster Lair.

      The story takes place in a small town called South Arc where the nearby forests are harboring monsters who
      regularly invade the town and scare of the citizens. This is where the player takes control of an orphan called
      Owen who is searching for his first job where he encounters a magical talking shovel. After realizing his destiny,
      he decides to start digging a lair and destroy the monster infestation.

      The view of the game uses the DS dual-screen technology, showing the world in the top screen while the bottom
      screen will show maps and item menus. The gameplay is the standard turn-based RPG battle, selecting options from a
      menu such as attack and casting spells as well as the option to turn and run from the battle.

      Players can pick up items and currency from monsters that are defeated in battle and use them to buy new weapons
      and armor for future battles or even furniture for Owen's house. There is also wireless capabilities where players
      can view and exchange dungeons through Wi-Fi.</story>

    <story>Das Dreamteam aus der ARD-Serie gibt es jetzt auch als Spiel für Nintendo DS! Das Spiel mit der Maus -
      genial!
      Viele lustig-lehrreiche Minispiele erwarten clevere Schlaumäuse oder solche, die es werden wollen. Im Bereich
      "Training" werden Sternchen gesammelt und nach und nach immer mehr Minispiele freigeschaltet, im "Diplom"-Bereich
      kann man vom "alten Stiefel" bis hin zum "Kleeblatt" jede Menge außergewöhnlicher Auszeichnungen einheimsen, und
      zuletzt darf man gegen bis zu drei andere Schlaumäuse um die Wette rätseln - der Beste bekommt die Krone!
      Unterstützung erhält der kleine Spieler dabei von der klugen Maus, dem tollpatschige Elefanten und der vorlauten
      Ente selbst.
      Animationen rund um die drolligen drei Freunde motivieren und unterhalten zwischen den Spielen, die ganz nebenbei
      Gedächtnis, Geschicklichkeit, Abstraktionsvermögen, Konzentration und Kreativität fördern und so das Denkvermögen
      spielend leicht schulen.</story>

    <story>Max &amp; the Magic Marker will be familiar to fans of platform games but provides a unique twist that allows
      the player's imagination to literally run wild. The player must use the magic marker to solve puzzles, overcome
      obstacles, and defeat enemies. Along the way you must collect ink in order to continue drawing. On the Wii, the
      player will use the nunchuk for player movement while the remote controls your marker. At any point the player can
      pause the action to draw their way out of sticky situations. Max, the game's hero, is a young boy who loves to
      draw. One day he receives a mysterious orange marker in the mail. As he begins drawing with the mysterious marker
      he quickly notices it has magical powers. Anything Max draws starts moving on the paper and comes to life. The
      monster he draws begins messing around with Max's artwork and so Max decides to draw himself into his picture and
      that is where the adventure begins.</story>

      In Mega Man Star Force, players explore towns and interact with people in the real world while the action-packed
      battles take place in the virtual "Wave World." Enemy encounters take place on a three by five grid in a 3D
      perspective, where players use a portfolio of Battle Cards that each have distinct attributes and attack powers.
      As the story progresses, players will acquire additional cards to build an arsenal that reflects their personal
      strategy. Players can also connect wirelessly via the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection with friends to create a Brother
      Band network, where they can share cards and get status upgrades.</story>

    <story>Many years after the events in the Mega Man Zero series, humans and Reploids (humanoid robots) have at last
      found peace. Two humans, Vent and Aile, work for a delivery company called Giro Express. After being ambushed
      during a delivery, they come in contact with something called 'biometal', which transforms them into the Maverick
      Hunter, X. Using their new powers, they decide to work for a group called "The Guardians", who protect civilians
      from Maverick attacks.

      Mega Man ZX is a side scrolling platformer for the Nintendo DS. While the gameplay is similar to the Mega Man X
      series, in that you find powerups to increase your health meter, gain subtanks to store surplus energy when
      needed, and gain new abilities such as swimming and flight through acquiring boss powers, the art style is more
      similar to the Mega Man Zero series of games.

      As players progress through the game, they gain the power of different types of "biometal", which gives them
      robotic weaponry and abilities. Different situations require different biometal suits, and sometimes (such as in
      civilian areas), it's best to return to your human form so that you can make your way through areas without being
      hassled. New models of biometal can be acquired from boss enemies. While you can hit their weak spots for more
      damage, it's actually beneficial not to, as the more damage you do to the weak spot results in more repairs that
      you need to make to the biometal later.</story>

    <story>Grey was a Reploid found in a hidden factory in suspended animation, accidentally awakened during battle.
      Ashe was a human Hunter, chasing after treasures and bounties. After their encounter with the evil Prometheus,
      they were rescued and taken to a Hunter Base, where their first mission was to help transport a mysterious
      Biometal. With another attack on the train occurring during their mission, they attempt to protect it - the
      Biometal, Model A, fuses with them, allowing them to become a powerful Mega Man! But other people are after Model
      A as well...

      Mega Man ZX Advent is the sequel to Mega Man ZX. Players can choose to play as either Grey or Ashe, each with
      their own storyline and slightly different weaponry, but the overall game remains the same. The game itself plays
      much like the side-scrolling platformer Mega Man X. However, once the main character fuses with the Biometal, they
      can transform into Model A, which allows them to steal the data of bosses, taking on their appearance as well as
      their abilities.</story>

    <story>Much of the gameplay is similar to its predecessor, Metal Max. The game is open-ended and non-linear, with
      the player given the freedom to decide where to go and what missions to do in whichever order. The player can
      choose the character classes, such as a mechanic or soldier, for the player characters. The battles are
      turn-based, with the characters able to fight either on foot or using tanks. The tanks can be created and
      customized by the player, who can modify and enhance each part of a vehicle, though there is a weight limit to
      each tank. In certain areas where tanks cannot pass, the characters must engage the enemies on foot. The game also
      features gambling machines where minigames can be played, including third-person shooter and racing games. Metal
      Max 2 Reloaded ,the Nintendo DS remake, added a shared inventory, option to play as a female, okama or reijin, new
      character classes, subclasses and skills from Metal Max 3, new characters, bounties, bosses, sidequests,
      locations, items and vehicles, expanded storyline and backstories of characters and monsters, increased difficulty
      over the SNES and GBA versions, the final boss of the game has a third form and a new game+ option has been added.

    <story>Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle
      game (after Polarium).

      Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet
      downwards towards a planet's atmosphere. There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the
      stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button. When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged
      either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen. Rockets carry upwards any
      other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many
      blocks at once. The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the
      top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors. Meteos features many different
      "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.

    <story>An episode in the Metroid Prime series which started on the GameCube, this game takes place between Metroid
      Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. Interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is sent to the distant Alimbic Cluster by
      the Galactic Federation to investigate a message saying that the source of ultimate power lies in this desolate
      part of the galaxy, once home to an advanced culture.

      Samus is not alone, however. Other races have heard this mysterious message, too. Six other bounty hunters, each
      with unique characteristics, will do everything to get their hands on the Alimbic relics for their own reasons.

      The single-player mode is more focused on shooting than other Metroid games but also has puzzles in classic
      Metroid fashion. Unlike previous games, Samus has all her moves from the start, but she still has to look for
      weapons. The player may also run into other bounty hunters in this mode.

      The multiplayer mode is similar to Unreal Tournament or Quake games. Players can choose from any hunter that was
      defeated in single-player mode. There are seven modes in total including: Nodes, Survival, Bounty, Prime Hunter,
      Battle, Capture, and Defender. Each mode has its own unique rules. There are a vast number of arenas that can be
      played over local wireless or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When using friend codes, voice chat before and after
      matches is enabled.</story>

    <story>In this pinball game based on Metroid Prime, Samus gets knocked and rolled around the table in Morph Ball
      form; the table contains Metroids, which can latch onto her and suck away health. Tables include the surface of
      Tallon IV, the Space Station, the Phazon Mines, and more can be unlocked by searching for artifacts and collecting
      bounties, which are found by destroying Space Pirates and other dangerous creatures.

      Metroid Prime Pinball is a pinball game with a Metroid theme. Players can collect power-ups such as missiles and
      super bombs, which can be helpful when defeating bosses. There are also missions to be completed within a time
      limit; these missions can involve defeating unique enemies that appear on the table or completing tasks such as
      wall jumping. Completing missions earns either artifacts or special tokens.

      The game also features a single-card multiplayer mode. In this mode, up to eight players can play. The game is a
      race to see who can reach a certain score first. Players lose points if they lose their ball. It is also possible
      to dump enemies onto opponents' tables to cause trouble for them.</story>

      challenges depending on which character they pick - playing as Sara features a puzzle-based element, whereas
      playing with Law thrusts the player into the action, often into car chases or shoot-outs where taking out the bad

    <story>Fairy Tale World is in trouble! With less and less children reading fairy tales, people will forget the
      stories and Fairy Tale World will disappear forever. The monsters who feature in all of the fairy tale stories
      don't like this at all, so they take it upon themselves to rescue their world.

      Monster Puzzle is a puzzle game similar to Zoo Keeper or Bejeweled. You have a set grid of monsters that can be
      dragged with the stylus either left and right or up and down (up to a maximum of three spaces). If you match at
      least three monsters horizontally or vertically, that row of monsters will disappear. If you match up a 2x2 square
      of monsters, a 4x4 square of monsters will be deleted.

      Unlike Zoo Keeper and Bejeweled, the goal is not to just eliminate monsters. Instead, players must 'claim' spaces
      where the monsters lie, which is done when you clear a set of monsters. In most stages, you will just need to
      claim the space once (which turns it orange), but in later stages, you will need to claim space twice (which turns
      orange spaces to red). After a certain percentage of space is claimed, the player moves onto the next stage.

      The game can also be played in versus mode with a friend. In this mode, the player who runs out of time first is
      the loser. Time can be added by continuing to clear monsters. If you clear multiple monsters simultaneously, a
      rock will appear on the opponent's screen which makes it more difficult for them to clear monsters.</story>

      sponsorships can be acquired: good performances have the player receive better bikes. It also features Crash

      Some mini-games have been included as well, including ATV hockey, Monster Truck Smash and Tag to name a few. The
      online mode has the player compete against other competitors. The gameplay is very similar to the console systems,
      certain buttons for gas, brakes while the Wii remote can be used as well.

      The DS and PSP versions are almost similar. While the DS has few vehicles and only has a championship mode unlike
      the many series in the major console versions, it contains ten exclusive tracks and three stadiums. The PSP
      version is almost similar, but has different series from the consoles: Race, One on One, Time Attack, Stunt

    <story>My World, My Way features Elise, who is a beautiful princess and has been given everything she's ever wanted.
      Upon turning 15, she realizes there's only one thing in the world she lacks, a handsome boyfriend. She sets out to
      remedy this by asking her father to hold a ball in her honor, to which every prince is invited to come and try his
      hand at wooing her. However, only one young man catches Elise's eye, and, as it turns out, he is no prince, but an
      adventurer. Knowing that fate itself has ordained him as her true love, she confesses her desire to share in his
      life. Unfortunately, he rejects her and only alternative is to prove to him that she can be an adventurer on her
      own. Much to the Kingdom's shock and dismay, Elise, the clueless princess, sets out on her adventure. It's her
      world, her way, and as long as she can help the weak, slay the monsters, and win enough fame, she'll get her
      happily ever after.</story>

    <story>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from,
      who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of
      an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page.
      Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're
      here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

      Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger.
      Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its
      mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by
      clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the
      game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

      The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

      The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and
      re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</story>

    <story>N+ is an enhanced version of the game N, originally a flash based browser game. Players control a small, but
      very agile ninja through different small areas. Next to movement, only a single button is used to jump, but this
      allows the ninja to run up walls, do wall jumps and cross large distances.

      Levels are divided over different episodes unlocked gradually. Each level consists of a single screen with a time
      limit. The amount of time can be replenished by collecting golden coins, but the main goals is to activate the
      exit, usually by touching a specific button or opening a number of doors. Areas are filled with hazards such as
      spikes and droids that shoot laser or rockets. There are also obstacles such as platforms that only move in a
      single direction or falling damage from high platforms. Death is always instant, but the player is given an
      unlimited amount of tries.

      The PSP version includes a mix of original levels and user-created ones with about 200 in total. There is also a
      level editor and unlike the Xbox 360 version these can be shared with other players. The PSP version shows the
      levels from a "medium" distance, while the DS version contains a far view and a close view on the screens. Physics
      are also slightly different in each version.

      There are both competitive and cooperative game modes available in multiplayer sessions. Players can switch
      between the pure mode with original graphics and the plus mode with enhanced visuals. The unlockables includes
      victory screens, new music and new colours for the ninja.</story>

    <story>A shooter of the vertical scroller type, Nanostray is similar to past games like Raiden and Tyrian to mention
      but a few.

      Players unlock features (concept art, backgrounds etc.) by fighting through an adventure mode, which in turn
      allows finished levels to be played in arcade mode, which is purely for attaining high scores. High scores in
      arcade mode can be logged on the games official site for ranking against other players around the world.

      Adventure mode also allows players to tackle missions in non linear order, however all three in one group must be
      finished before the next three can be attempted and so on.

      The touch screen is used for current status and to scan the end of level bosses for weaknesses.

      Challenge modes are added when adventure levels are completed, allowing players to play through the game with a
      set of restrictions, making high scores more difficult, but increasing the challenge and lastability of the game.

      Two players can fight competitively to get the highest score before a timer ends or be the first to reach a
      certain predefined limit of points.

      The game supports single cart play for multiplayer so only one copy is needed.</story>

      their chance of success. Using the new interchangeable attack system, players select a main character to complete
      the mission and then customize their attack scheme by selecting special techniques from other available characters
      -- increasing their chance of success by combining the best techniques for the mission. Players can activate
      special attacks using the Nintendo DS stylus on the touch screen or by blowing into the microphone. Just like a
      true ninja, in NARUTO: Ninja Council 3, players will have to protect, defend or defeat as they train hard to
      perfect their skills in order to progress through the ranks in over 40 missions ranging in difficulty from
      moderate to challenging. Up to four players (wireless) can choose from over 20 different characters with four
      different playing modes including Timed Mode, Scroll Collection Mode and Head-to-Head Versus Mode.</story>

    <story>Sometime during the games' stories, the presiding god of the dream world is infuriated when an unprecedented
      vengeful spirit infestation threatens his realm. He abducts the souls of the dreaming three White Dragon
      Priestesses and their Eight Guardians —whose negligence he deems to be the main cause of the invasion— to demand
      their eternal servitude to him. They are rescued by the god's younger brother who offers his mansion as hospice.
      With his help, they seek to restore order to the dream world and rescue their captured comrades for a safe return
      to their rightful eras.
      At the start of each game, the player must pick one protagonist to use. Whoever they pick decides their possible
      romance routes. Players can read broad introductions for each protagonist's era or quickly skip to selecting a
      guardian. Regardless of the player's protagonist and selected individual, their starting team of characters will
      always be the same. Variations of the beginning sequence occur based on their team composition.</story>

    <story>At its core Nervous Brickdown is a Arkanoid-clone and the first ten levels feature the familiar gameplay of
      using a horizontally moving paddle at the bottom and a ball to destroy bricks at the top of the screen. But each
      of the ten worlds (divided into 9 levels and one boss fight) feature a different type of gameplay.

      In the second stage the player needs to draw the paddle on the screen himself to knock the ball against ink blots.
      Depending on the form of the drawn paddle, the ball will bounce off differently. And to spice things up even more,
      the paddle isn't restricted to just horizontal movement anymore but can instead be freely moved around at the
      bottom of the screen. Other stages require the player to move through a haunted house and kill ghosts by blowing
      into the microphone or contain a laser beam which increases it's speed.

      By playing successfully through the levels, the player unlocks bonuses which range from extra lives to the ability
      to change the trajectory of the ball by blowing into the microphone.

      The game also features a multiplayer mode for two players in which the ball changes into the player's paddle color
      so it will only bounce off the paddle with the corresponding color.</story>

    <story>Get ready for a story so epic it could only unfold in the corridors of the world's largest museum--the
      Smithsonian Institution. Museum guard-turned entrepreneur Larry Daley discovers that his favorite exhibits, and
      some of his best friends, from New York's Natural History Museum are being shipped off to the archives at the
      Smithsonian. Larry gets a distress call from the miniature cowboy, Jedediah, reporting that Egyptian ruler
      Kahmunrah and a trio of heinous henchmen--namely Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon and Al Capone--are plotting to take
      over the museum, then the world. Speeding to the nation's capitol, Larry is clearly in over his head. But with
      some impressive new pals, including the irrepressible Amelia Earhart, along with familiar friends Teddy Roosevelt
      and Octavius, Larry will stop at nothing to restore the Smithsonian before dawn.</story>

    <story>Ninjatown is a family-friendly tower defense game for the Nintendo DS that features the artwork and
      characters of ex-EGM editor Shawn Smith's "Shawnimals" universe. In the game, players must build Ninja Huts at key
      spots along a set pathway to defend each of the game's 36 levels from the invading forces of Mr. Demon. Players
      can build up to eight different kinds of Ninja Huts, each kind containing its own category of Ninja, from Wasabi
      pea-shooting Sniper Ninjas to bearded Mountain Ninjas.

      There are also a variety of "Ol' Master Ninja Powers" that can help the player in a pinch. These range from
      blowing into the DS microphone to push enemies backwards with a gust of wind to tapping enemies on screen in a
      short period of time in order to deal extra damage to them.

      The game is divided into 9 "districts", each containing 3 standard tower defense maps and 1 boss map. Each level
      in the game takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, with the full game clocking in at around 6-8 hours.</story>

    <story>Nintendogs lets you take care of virtual pets (dogs, obviously) on your Nintendo DS. You can train your
      puppies by speaking commands into the microphone, pat the pooch with the stylus, play games like as "fetch" with a
      Frisbee, buy toys, food, and accessories, and take part in competitions to win trophies.

      If there are other Nintendo DS users with Nintendogs nearby with both of you in "Bark Mode", you can link the
      games wirelessly and see both dogs on the same screen.

      You initially only have 6 (US/EU), 5 (JP) of the 18 (US/EU), 15 (JP) breeds available when you start playing the
      game (the six breeds being determined by which version of the game you buy), but as you progress, you unlock more
      breeds and items to buy. If you connect with another user that has another breed of dog not available to you then
      their dog's breed will be unlocked for you.

      The available versions to purchase are:

      Japanese Versions:

      1. Chihuahua &amp; Friends: Beagle, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Chihuahua, Labrador Retriever, Shih Tzu.
      2. Miniature Dachshund &amp; Friends: German Shepherd, Miniature Dachshund, Miniature Schnauzer, Pug, Yorkshire
      Terrier.
      3. Shiba &amp; Friends: Miniature Pinscher, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Shetland Sheepdog, Shiba Inu, Toy Poodle.

      North American and European Versions:

      1. Chihuahua &amp; Friends: Boxer, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Chihuahua, German Shepherd, Shetland Sheepdog,
      Yorkshire Terrier.
      4. Dachshund &amp; Friends: Beagle, Golden Retriever, Miniature Dachshund, Pug, Shih Tzu, Siberian Husky.
      5. Lab &amp; Friends: Labrador Retriever, Miniature Pinscher, Miniature Schnauzer, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Shiba
      Inu, Toy Poodle.

      Retriever, Miniature Dachshund, Yorkshire Terrier.

    <story>In a fitting reflection of the relationship shared with Amaterasu, the powerful sun goddess who embodied a
      wolf in Ōkami, the child deity Chibiterasu manifests in the form of a white wolf cub in Ōkamiden. The game is set
      nine months after the events of the previous game, and the young sun god is summoned to battle a sinister force
      that has drained the landscape of colour, leaving it withered and faded where once it was luminous with life.

      Ōkamiden shares many gameplay elements with its predecessor, including the paintbrush used as a weapon against
      enemies and for puzzle solving. Chibiterasu can also team up with various companions during the game for
      additional abilities.</story>

    <story>Onpu Island is an island populated by musical spirits called Ontama. These strange, multicolored creatures
      can allow skilled performers, called 'Ontamaestros', to perform music by gathering Ontama. Beat and Rest, two
      young friends from a small village on the island, find an Ontama on the street. They discover that the Ontama are
      being captured, and so they set out to find out what's happening to them, and to become Ontamaestros themselves.

      Ontamarama is an action rhythm game that makes full use of the DS' capabilities. Ontama appear on the screen, and
      can be tapped, tossed, and circled. Clearing an Ontama makes fills a note on the bar along the top of the screen,
      and when the note reaches the end of the bar, the correct button must be pressed to play the note. There are four
      different colored Ontama, and you also need to watch out for the white and black ones which can help or hinder you
      in other ways!

      The game includes a story mode, a tutorial mode, a free play mode where you can play songs cleared in the story
      mode, and a challenge mode. There is also a shop where you can buy songs and items with points acquired during the
      game.</story>

    <story>Open Season is based on the Sony Pictures Animation's CG animated film of the same name, where a rowdy brood
      of forest animals turn the tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters.

      The game is a side-scrolling-puzzle adventure. The plot of the game is to complete puzzles and avoid traps to
      advance from level to level. Every level completed will raise your friendship with the different animals of the
      forest. Once friends, these animals can be used as allies to attack and defeat the hunters encountered along the
      way.

      Following the plot of the movie, once the player has become friends with a sufficient amount of animals, he can
      then take on the evil hunter leader Shaw.

      The gameplay loop is to find clever ways to solve puzzles that prevent you from moving forward in a level. To
      solve these puzzles, the player can switch between the two main characters : Boog, a 900 pound bear and Elliott, a
      crazy deer. Both characters have their specific skills which need to be wisely used to progress through the
      levels. To solve most of the puzzles, Boog and Elliott, each controlled individually and seperately, will have to
      work as a team.

      To complicate the gameplay a bit, the player will encounter hunters on the way which he can defeat "using" the now
      friendly skunks, beavers, squirrels... which all have their unique skills.

      This game is a 2,5D side-scrolling game with an emphasis on spatial puzzles. The story mode contains 27 levels. In
      addition, there's also eight minigames.</story>

    <story>Orcs &amp; Elves is a turn-based role-playing game based on improved DOOM RPG engine. The story follows an
      elf named Elli who, along with a talking magic wand Ellon, heads to the depths of a devastated dwarven citadel to
      find out what happened there, battling foes of many kinds, finding mysterious items and meeting various people.

      The game uses a first person perspective and dungeons are grid-based, similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye of the
      Beholder series; the player can only move between squares, forward, backward, strafe left or right, turn in 90
      degree increments. Enemies and dungeon features are drawn with sprite graphics. There are some 3D objects in the
      dungeons as well, and the game employs some 3D camera movements in the cutscenes. The dungeons mostly consist of
      one level, though it is possible to move between different parts of the dungeons and revisit the previous dungeons
      as necessary.</story>

      The Cheersquad's success depends on how well the player does. The game takes advantage of the system's touch
      screen by having players tap circles in time with the beat of the music. Other actions include tapping a stack of
      circles repeatedly, following a moving ball along a path by dragging the stylus on it, and spinning a wheel. Each
      successful action fills a power bar at the top of the touch screen and contributes to the score. This bar drains
      continuously and will take large hits if the player misses a beat or two. If the bar hits zero, the game is over.

      Ouendan contains 15 licensed songs with a level dedicated to each, and the songs are drawn from popular Japanese
      Rock. There are also 4 difficulty levels, 2 of which have to be unlocked through play. Each difficulty level
      alters the number of circles that need to be tapped, paths to trace, and wheels to spin. The timing of each is
      also changed, with easier difficulties giving more time to anticipate when to tap, while harder difficulties speed
      this up. A multiplayer mode is also featured, as well as a download &amp; play option that sends the tutorial
      level to DS's that don't have the game.</story>

    <story>A portable adventure game based on the animated movie of the same name and which chronicled the adventures of
      a group of animals in their struggle against a recently-built housing development.

      Playing as either RJ, Hammy or Verne you'll have to complete several incursions into the human dwellings to steal
      food, supplies and sabotage further housing developments.

      Gameplay-wise the game is a 3rd-person perspective stealth-adventure hybrid in which you must navigate through
      several houses looking to retrieve your current objective while avoiding the many traps set by the homeowners (as
      well as the homeowners themselves). To get by you can make use of several unique items that allow you to set up
      diversions, or create them yourself by blowing into the microphone. Each character has individual strengths and
      weaknesses and in many missions you'll have to alternate between each character to successfully complete the
      level.

      As a unique feature the game displays the standard 3rd person perspective on the top screen while the lower screen
      features a top-down view which allows you to better scan the levels for traps and items, both rendered with fully
      polygonal graphics.

      Features a single player campaign and a wireless multiplayer mode with a two-player mode in which two players
      compete to clear out a level of food.</story>

      and combining minions in battle, pointing and sweeping them to attack enemies and solving puzzles to execute his

      range of warped enemies to hunt down the Kindred, a cult dedicated to resurrecting the mighty Dragon Kin, a race
      of humanoid dragon hybrids, determined to replace the Overlord's despotism with their own. Extending the Overlord
      series' trademark humour, gameplay focuses on the mischievous physical comedy of the minion's antics and is

      captured by the ghosts and you must save him. You use the touch-screen to draw Pac-Man and try to eat the ghosts.
      There are a few different types of ghosts that require a different strategy for each type.

      You have Pinky that just moves around slowly and Blue that will make a quick dash as you approach him. There is
      Numboos which is multiple ghosts with numbers and you must eat them in order if you wish to defeat them. Bari-Boo
      has a shield and you can only defeat him by attacking from behind, if you hit his shield in front of him or from
      the side you just bounce off. There's the ink ghosts which throw ink and then there's the block ghosts which
      require you to break their defenses with a bomb.

      During your adventure you will learn to draw arrows to shoot ghosts and stun them, as well as ghosts that are
      floating in bubbles. You will also be able to draw bombs to destroy blocks that are in your path. There are many
      things to do with the touch screen in this game. Pac-Pix is a Pac-Man game like no other before it.</story>

    <story>In Paws &amp; Claws Regal Resort, players can mix business with their love for animals by building and
      managing the finest pet resort while also caring for guests' pets. In the game, players can expand their resort
      with six types of animals - dogs, cats, horses, hamsters, birds, and rabbits - and optimize their experience by
      feeding, bathing and exercising the animals. As a resort becomes more popular, upgrades will be necessary to keep
      the animals happy, so players will need to venture into town to purchase supplies. If players are too busy caring
      for the animals and cannot go to town for supplies, they can read up on facts about each animal and take quizzes
      in order to unlock upgrades for the resort.</story>

    <story>Dogz 2 is the sequel to the Nintendo DS Dogz, a title of the Nintendo DS Petz series.

      Differently to the traditional pet games, the focus of Dogz 2 is in the 18 mini-games, seven of which are card
      games that can be played in multiplayer, like blackjack and memory games, which will give the player goodies, like
      furniture and toys and costumes for the dogs and even more rooms of the house, after completed or won. There are
      11 different breeds (like dalmatian, beagle or poodle) to choose from this time and 250 different items to fill
      the house with.

      There is no pet caring in Dogz 2, but there is still plenty of interaction with them. Many of the collectibles may
      produce a reaction on the dogs. The player can also make his/her puppies to wear costumes and even give them 14
      different oral orders through the microphone of the DS.</story>

    <story>Picross DS is a touch screen-based puzzle game for the Nintendo DS. By following the numbers on the left and
      top of the game grid, players can uncover the picture hidden away. The rules are simple - if there is one number
      on a line, say, 10, then you know that there are ten squares in a row that must be chipped away on that line. If
      the numbers read something like 2 7, then you must chip away two squares somewhere in the row, separated by at
      least one empty square, and then seven squares to be chipped away. By applying these rules horizontally and
      vertically to the grid, you can work out the picture using logic.

      There are two methods of control: you can use the Control Pad to move a cursor, the A Button to chip a square, the
      B Button to mark it, and the X Button to zoom in or out (similar to Nintendo's previous Picross games).
      Alternatively, you can use the stylus to play. In this mode, the Control Pad changes the functions of the stylus.
      When you press Up, you'll chip squares, Down will mark them, Left will zoom in and out, while Right allows you to
      scroll. The buttons on the right of the DS perform the same functions, which is helpful if you're left-handed.

      Picross DS has a variety of different modes:

      1. Picross - This is standard Picross. Play through easy, medium and difficult puzzles, or learn how to play. You
      are penalized with time for any mistakes you make in easy and medium modes. In difficult, your mistakes are not
      noted at all.

      2. Daily Picross - Play a quick set of five Picross puzzles, once a day. Each day, your score is added to a chart,
      so you can track whether you're improving or getting worse, similar to Brain Age.

      3. My Picross - Design your own Picross puzzles by drawing on the grid. When you're done, you can play your
      puzzles, or send them to others.

      4. Competition Picross - Play Picross against others in this mode. You can choose to use single-cart multiplayer,
      multi-cart multiplayer, or online play via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

      You can also download additional puzzle packs for Picross DS by using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, including puzzles
      from Mario's Picross.</story>

    <story>Take on the world in Planet Puzzle League, a simple but addictive puzzle game that you may recognize as
      Tetris Attack, Panel De Pon, or Pokémon Puzzle League. Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to
      arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile. This causes them to disappear.
      Advanced players will be able to arrange tiles so that when they land, they clear additional tiles to stop the
      tiles from rising and score even more points!

      Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:

      1. Endless - Play forever until you fail. The tiles rise faster over time.
      2. Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.
      3. Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!
      4. Vs. COM - Play against the CPU. Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!
      5. Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.
      6. Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.

      Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode. Play these short games once a day to track
      your skill over a long period of time. Are you getting better? Or worse?

      You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Modes of play
      include Birthday Battle (play against people who share your date of birth), Free Play Battle (play an unranked
      match), and Friend Battle (play against Friends you've traded Friend Codes with).</story>

    <story>Platinum Sudoku offers 20 million Sudoku puzzles (in five levels of difficulty), over 300 Kakuro puzzles and
      a number of mini-games. The game starts with a tutorial mode and the twenty million puzzles will only be available
      to you after completing 100 puzzles in Easy, Medium or Hard mode. Solving all puzzles in Hard mode unlocks the Pro
      mode, solving the Pro puzzles unlocks the Sudoku X mode. New background graphics, fonts, grid styles and music are
      also unlockable.

      The object of Sudoku is to fill a square grid measuring 9x9 spaces, further divided into nine 3x3 squares with the
      numbers 1 to 9. Each horizontal row and each vertical column can only contain each number once, and this also
      applies to each of the square grids. Each grid already contains a few numbers, how many depends on the level of
      difficulty. The game layout can be switched around for left-handed players by choosing an option from the menu.

      Filling the grid is done by either drawing the desired character directly onto the grid on the Touch Screen, by
      pointing to that number on a small grid or by using the D-pad. Several numbers can be entered in one cell in Draft
      mode. When the player has deduced which number is the only one possible, the choice is made definitive. It is
      possible to ask for hints, but these cost "coins" that have to be earned by solving puzzles. Hint A gives some
      possible numbers for the current cell, Hint B provides the correct number for the current cell, and Hint C scans
      the whole board and marks cells as right or wrong. It is also possible to choose several assisting features from
      the game menu, for instance highlighting the current row or column, highlighting the "easiest to solve" cells or
      automatically filling the grid with all possibilities for each cell.

      Kakuro puzzles are like crosswords except the grids are filled with numbers. The grid consists of black and white
      cells. The white cells must be filled with numbers, the black cells contain the clues. Each entry can only contain
      a number (between 0 and 9) once and the sum of the numbers must match the clue. For example if the clue is "11"
      and the entry is three cells wide, the solution could be "1, 6, 4" or "2, 5, 4" but not "2, 7, 2".

      The mini-games included in Platinum Sudoku are Subtract (drop numbers unto others to subtract them until you reach
      zero), Pair Match (draw lines between pairs of numbers), Shuffle (slider puzzle), Choice Block (find the missing
      number), High Sum (choose the block with the highest sum) and Mine Detector (mine sweeper). If a challenge is met,
      the game is unlocked in the menu and you can try to improve your high score.

      Two players can play co-op to solve a grid together or compete to see who is the fastest in solving a grid.
      Finally there is a Custom Grid mode which allows you to design your own puzzles.</story>

    <story>Pokémon HeartGold is an enhanced remake of one of the second installments in the Pokémon Main RPG Series,
      Pokémon Gold.

      Set in the region of Johto, the player controls a new Pokémon Trainer on his/her way to meet up with Pokémon
      Researcher Professor Elm at his lab to receive his/her first Pokémon. While running an errand for Elm, the player
      returns to find that a thief has stolen one of the professor's Pokémon. This event starts your quest to becoming a
      Pokémon master, leading you through the region of Johto and later Kanto, to battle the mysterious Team Rocket and
      capture all 493 Pokémon.

      Along with retaining most of the original game's features, HeartGold contains quite a few new updates. Like Gold
      the story will incorporate the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh (who can be seen on the game's box art), although this time
      in a bigger fashion. Graphics have been upgraded to 3D models to resemble the series previous Nintendo DS
      iterations, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. The ability to have any one of your Pokémon following you on the
      Overworld Screen which was limitedly seen in Pokémon Yellow has been added.

      Included with the game is a peripheral known as the Pokéwalker. Acting as a pedometer, the Pokéwalker allows you
      to wirelessly transfer a Pokémon from HeartGold to it. When there is a Pokémon in the Pokéwalker it gains
      "experience points" for each step you take. The player also earns a form of money known as "watts", which is used
      to help catch other Pokémon and buy items.

      The game is compatible with the following games via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: Pokémon SoulSilver, Diamond, Pearl,
      and Platinum.</story>

    <story>Together with Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl, this game is the 3rd games in the 4th generation of the
      Pokémon series. Set in a new region, Sinnoh, it includes 107 new Pokémon, bringing the total up to 493. Pokémon
      Platinum includes for the first time in the 4th generation, the Battle Frontier which can be played on and
      off-line, make Poffins on-line. Players can collect badges, challenge the Elite Four, and become the ultimate
      Pokémon master.

      The game continues the basic idea of previous Pokémon games - the player, a new trainer, sets out on a quest to
      catch every known Pokémon and defeat the Pokémon league. Along the way, the player will attempt to foil the plots
      of the evil organization, Team Galactic, who seek to use a trio of legendary Pokémon to awaken a sleeping titan
      with the power to control space. There are many sidequests and other activities along the way, the Battle
      Frontier, expanded on-line options, downloadable content via Mystery Gift, a brand new GTS with the option to
      receive notifications of completed traded over the Wii, record battle videos, the option to submit one's Pokémon
      party data for others to see and the Distortion World, which defies the laws of gravity and contains Platinum's
      mascot, Giratina.

      The core Pokémon series features an RPG turn-based battle system. Each monster can learn up to four attacks. In a
      single turn, the two opponents select their attacks, and the one with the higher Speed attacks first. The amount
      of damage is influenced by the Attack and Defense stats. In the past, attacks were automatically classified as
      Physical or Special based on their elemental type. In Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum each attack can be individually
      categorized, so attacks which use natural elements are Special, and those which use simple force are Physical.

      The Pokémon Contests from Ruby and Sapphire return, with many new features. In addition to the attack performance,
      where the player must try to impress the judge with flashy moves, players will also dress up their Pokémon and
      dance in time to music. Diamond and Pearl also bring back the real time system from Gold and Silver, where day and
      night are reflected in your game. Some Pokémon are only catchable during certain times.</story>

    <story>In the region of Oblivia, a gang of thieves known as the "Pokémon Pinchers" are stealing wild Pokémon and
      planning to use them for their own nefarious purposes. Two Pokémon Rangers, Summer and Ben, are sent to
      investigate. However, after an encounter with the Pinchers, one of them is kidnapped while the other is left
      stranded on an island. There they meet a Pichu with a ukulele, who teams up with them to help rescue its Pichu
      friends who have also been captured by then Pinchers. Can you rescue your partner, and save the Pokémon of the
      Oblivia region?

      Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs is the third in the Pokémon Ranger series. As with the previous games, you move
      your character around using a device known as the stylus, as well as battling with a device called the "capture
      styler" (represented by the stylus). To battle, you encounter a Pokémon on the touch screen, and your aim is to
      repeatedly draw connecting loops around it until you deplete its health to zero, allowing it to join your team.
      Pokémon can be used in the environment to clear obstacles and help you progress (such as such as cutting trees,
      extinguishing fires and so on), or by assisting you in battle and helping you weaken enemy Pokémon. Near the start
      of the game, Ukulele Pichu becomes a part of your team and randomly appears during battles to assist. If you tap
      it when it appears, it will jump into battle and play its ukulele, which scatters musical notes around the screen
      which weaken enemies.

      A little bit further into the game, you also gain the help of the Legendary Pokémon dogs, Raikou, Entei and
      Suicune, first introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver. These Pokémon have special abilities that allow you to reach
      places that you normally couldn't (for example, Raikou can leap across large gaps). To summon these Pokémon, you
      must draw a special sign with the stylus that represents them, but these can only be drawn outside where the sky
      can be seen.

      After a key point in the game, you also unlock the ability to travel back in time with Celebi, which gives you
      access to wireless multiplayer Pokémon Ranger missions. These missions can be played with up to four players, and
      Rangers can team up to help capture Pokémon more quickly. This is a great help as each mission must be completed
      within a certain time for it to be a success. Most wireless missions can also be played solo, but are more
      difficult this way. You can also earn experience which can be used to increase your capture styler's power, health
      and speed.</story>

    <story>Polar Bowler is a bowling game. But no ordinary, the game uses an Arctic theme (more or less). Furthermore,
      there is not even a ball in the game.

      First off, the game offers two different game modes, “Straight Bowling” and “Power Bowling”. Furthermore there are
      7 different lanes and 6 different characters in the game, so you can play an Ice bear, a Penguin, a Snowman, or
      even Santa Claus. But the game starts only with one lane and one character.

      Straight Bowling acts much like the classic bowling. You have the ten pins and your character, which is the game’s
      substitute for your ball, and you must smash as many pins as possible in order to get a good score (and to win the
      game when you are not playing alone). You start your ride by positioning your character at the beginning where you
      want him to slide from. In contrary to a real bowling, you can’t throw the “ball” diagonal, but that’s not needed
      too. Once your ride has started, you can move your character left and right and change his destination. You can
      even slide a curve, if you’re good. If not, the physic do their job. You can even control how fast you slide, but
      that only at the beginning of the ride. Their, you can choose the speed by tighten the line you use to throw you
      into the lane.

      Power Bowling sets on top of this. Here the game gets spiced up by Power Ups. After you positioned your character
      and tightened your line, at that time you can’t change your position anymore, Power Ups appear on the lane. Once
      you collect them, they work in this throw, and this throw only, once you return to the start, their bonuses will
      be reset. So you must collect them, and use them immediately (will be automatically used, when the character
      impacts on the pins). There are two different types of Power Ups, one that affect your character, and one that
      affects your score.

      The following Power Ups are possible to find: Bomb (doubles the power of the character; at the impact it will
      smash more pins then regular), Zap (will send an electrical discharge out on impact with the pins, which will
      smash much more then the bomb), Vapor (will vaporize all pins on impact; will result in a strike even when you
      only touch one of the pins at the far sides), Multiplier (will multiply the amount of pins you smash with the type
      you collected for your total score), Multiplier can be found as 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x. Smashing 5 pins with a
      multiplier of 3x will result in 5 regular points and 10 power points.

      The basic scoring is on both game modes the same, it is also the same like regular bowling rules. In Power Bowling
      mode, once you finished the game, the amount of power points you gathered, will be added to the regular points,
      and so both of them will determine your final score. So, with many strikes you can get awesome scores.

      Every time you reach 200 points on a single lane, you unlock a new lane or a new character.

      And like a real bowling game, the game can be a multiplayer game, were up to four player can participate, playing
      on the same computer in Hotseat mode.</story>

    <story>This is a puzzle game similar to Tetris in that blocks fall from above, and to clear the lines before the
      screen fills up, you must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white). To change the
      color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select it with the stylus, then tap it again to make the block flip.
      You can also drag the stylus along the screen to change the polarity if many block at the same time.

      There is also a puzzle mode where time isn't as critical. Blocks aren't falling, but are just in a certain pattern
      on the screen. The object is to make the polarity of every block in each horizontal line the same. But the trick
      is to do the entire screen with one swipe of the stylus. There are 100 puzzles in this mode and they can get very
      difficult.

      The most addicting part of this game is the multiplayer. Utilizing the DS's two screens, you can see your blocks
      and your opponent's blocks. As you create a horizontal line all of the same polarity, that line is then scrambled
      and sent to your adversary. The object is to clear your screen before your opponent does. The multiplayer mode
      does not require 2 Game Cards to play. In fact, when the game is sent over to another DS through the IPL, they
      don't even need to play multiplayer. The person that received the game can play a simple demo of the game by
      themselves.</story>

    <story>At the beginning of Pony Friends, the player has the choice to buy a pre-defined pony or create his one from
      scratch by choosing from a variety of different colors and patterns for each of the four parts (body, legs, face
      and hair).

      Once a pony has been created and named, the player has to care for it by feeding or brushing it in order to keep
      it's values from decreasing. Depending on how good the values and how well the pony has been treated, it will
      react differently to the players hand (the stylus). A new pony for example will be afraid at first and will run
      away when the player makes sudden movements.

      Besides caring for your pony, outfitting it with accessories or giving it small treats like apples, you can also
      do racing events, trail riding or let it perform tricks. While the player can't control the horse itself in the
      racing events, he needs to cheer it on through the microphone to keep it going. But if the player shouts too loud
      or not loud enough, the pony will slow down.

      During trail riding the player can instead pet the pony or order it to gallop through the forest to train it.
      While the pony rides on the trail, the player can look around and can each day fulfill a quest by photographing
      specific animals around the trail by touching them with the stylus. There are also hidden gates which open up
      additional trails if found and touched.

      Tricks are performed by the pony if it's out on the field. Depending on it's condition and on how many awards the
      player has already earned with the pony, the trick will be more difficult.</story>

      gameplay styles to ensure that the computer controlled opponents are always challenging and forcing the player to
      think and chance their style of play to avoid being out-thought by the game. It learns counter attacks that target
      your weaknesses and look to exploit any repetitive tactics players use. Defenders react better to danger, closing
      down the ball and charging at shots and the goalkeepers hold shots that are closer to them as well. Teammates make
      more intelligent runs into space and the close control has been sharpened to ensure quick and fluid passing and
      speedy attacks can be built. The next gen versions also feature extensive edit modes so players can completely

    <story>Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity is a puzzle game similar to the Incredible Machine series. During the 100
      levels the goal is always to press a button. To achieve this goal the player has a selection of items to his
      disposal - nothing fancier than boards or balls - to build a construction of chain reactions. When he starts the
      experiment, a ball (in seldom cases a vehicle) gets released to set the thing in motion. An innovation compared to
      similar games is that the physics simulation doesn't get disabled during the building phase. This means the player
      can destroy his constructions when being careless during placing another item. There is also a help functions
      which gives hints to the correct solution.

      By beating levels the player unlocks so-called sandbox levels where he can freely experiment with the physics
      engine. Mini games, e.g. building a tower which has to withstand an earthquake, can be played against other
      players. There are a small differences between the versions: the PC version offers an editor to build own
      experiments and the DS version offers fewer sandbox levels and mini games.</story>

      apprentice, Luke, travel there on behalf of Lady Dahlia, who has requested their presence to resolve the issue.
      However, it quickly becomes apparent that St. Mystere is quite strange... all the townsfolk seem to be obsessed
      with puzzles, and Baron Reinhold's fortune isn't the only secret that the town has hidden...

      Professor Layton and the Curious Village is a puzzle game which uses the works of Akira Tago, author of the
      Japanese series of Head Gymnastics books as its basis. As both Layton and Luke, players explore the town of St.
      Mystere screen by screen. Each screen contains puzzles, either hidden in the scenery or by talking to characters.
      Upon finding a puzzle, the screen changes and the player is presented with the puzzle itself: the description of
      the puzzle on the top screen, and the puzzle (as well as the place to input the answer) on the bottom screen. Some
      puzzles require simple calculation, some have a trick answer, while others are riddles. The selection of puzzles
      is quite varied. If the player gets stuck, they can purchase a hint with 'Hint Coins'. However, these are limited
      - more can be found hidden in the game world, but there a set number of coins in the entire game.

      Professor Layton has a visual style similar to that of a watercolor painting. While most of the game does not have
      much animation, key story sequences are told in fully animated and voice acted scenes. The game also used Nintendo
      Wi-Fi Connection to connect to the Internet and download additional puzzles for players to solve.</story>

      is too late - the box appears to have claimed another victim, and yet is missing. The only clue is a ticket for
      the luxurious Molentary Express, found in the apartment. Will Layton and Luke be able to solve this latest
      mystery?

      Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box is the sequel to Professor Layton and the Curious Village, taking place
      directly after the events of the first game. Players take the role of the titular professor and his assistant Luke
      as they explore the Molentary Express for clues to the mystery of the Elysian Box. By talking to people and
      examining the environment, players discover puzzles, which when solved progress the story further.

      As with the first game, puzzle can range from logic problems, to riddles, to simple calculation. If stuck, players
      can spend 'Hint Coins' that they can find throughout the game - but there are a finite amount available, so they
      should only be used when needed.</story>

      meaning of all the destruction, and is it related to the village?s folklore legend of a ?specter?? The unfolding
      story details how Professor Layton and his apprentice, Luke, met.

      Professor Layton and the Last Specter follows the structure that has become a staple for the series, in which the

      touchscreen, with bonus puzzles made available to download on a weekly basis.

    <story>Professor Layton and his assistant Luke attend the unveiling of a new invention called a time machine. The

      With the Prime Minister missing, London is in chaos! Shortly after these events, the puzzle-solving pair receive a
      letter, which has apparently been sent by Luke's future self, stating that London is in serious trouble. The
      Professor and Luke follow the directions in the letter, which leads them to their most exciting adventure yet...

      Professor Layton and the Unwound Future is the third installment in the Professor Layton series. As with the
      previous games in the series, players explore game scenes by tapping on areas of interest with the stylus. Doing
      so can cause Layton and Luke to examine objects, talk to characters, finding hint coins (which can be spent on
      hints for difficult puzzles) and most importantly, discover puzzles that can be solved. Puzzles range from math,
      to logic, to riddles to sliding block puzzles, as well as many more different types. There are also "secret" areas
      in scenes which, when tapped, may leave a puff of dust or a rustle of leaves. Repeatedly tapping on these areas
      reveals a hidden secret, such as a bonus hint coin, or even a hidden, more difficult puzzle.

      New to Unwound Future is the addition of the 'Super Hint'. While as with the previous games, you can spend a hint
      coin to unlock up to three hints, there is also another option. Once these three hints have been exhausted, for
      the price of two hint coins, you can unlock a more detailed 'Super Hint' as a last resort. There are also three
      new minigames incorporated into the game. In the Picture Book game, you must place the correct stickers in the
      right spots to make a story that makes sense. In the Toy Car game, you must place tiles which navigate a toy car
      around the board, collect all the objects, and then reach the goal. Finally, in the Parrot game, you must tie
      ropes onto pegs to help your parrot deliver parcels to people who have requested them.</story>

    <story>Puchi Puchi Virus does not resemble the ordinary puzzle game. The usual "object drop" style was replaced with
      a more intuitive system of "object linkage". Its simple design and surprisingly in-depth game play can addict even
      the most demanding puzzle game enthusiasts. The object is to form at least a single triangle formation by linking
      viruses together and erasing them from the screen. Victory conditions vary from mission to mission, but erasing
      all of the viruses will be the fundamental rule of this game. Erase all the viruses and you win, but if the screen
      gets filled with the emerging viruses you lose. Note: there is a twist to this system that gives depth to the game
      play. Viruses turn to stone if left alone for a while, which cannot be selected to form a triangle. However, these
      stones can be erased if they are within a triangle that you create. With a little luck and practice players can
      rake in massive points by letting the viruses turn to stones and erasing them all at once.</story>

    <story>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the
      students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make
      their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game
      of, Puyo Pop!

      A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining
      four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will
      fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be
      exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

      When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting
      the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you
      will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos
      to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

      Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows
      up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</story>

    <story>Puzzle Chronicles is a casual game that combines item-matching puzzling with RPG elements, including
      character progression and a fantasy story line in the vein of Infinity's earlier titles Puzzle Quest: Challenge of
      the Warlords and Puzzle Kingdoms.

      The puzzle part is played on a board with vertical divider line in the middle. The goal is to push the divider
      line back to decrease the opponent's territory until no more moves are possible. This is done by matching groups
      of three gems into like colours along the divider line. These groups fall on the board horizontally. Pushing the
      divider line back is done by destroying rage gems. There are also special abilities and a sidekick known as a
      Warbeast that attacks the enemy when a sufficient amount of gems of certain colour has been cleared.

      Removing gems also enables the player to collect mana, power spells and items that are then used to attack the
      opponent and reduce their board space. In addition to the main puzzle game, there are five other mini-games
      ranging from upgrading the Warbeast companion to crafting new items, while navigating a number of different maps
      and completing simple quests.</story>

    <story>Puzzle City contains elements of SimCity and Tetris. As the new Constructor Manager at Puzzle City, Inc., the
      player has to build cities by placing colored blocks (in shapes resembling those of Tetris), which arrive on a
      conveyor belt. Each color represents a kind of building (green for residential, yellow for industrial, blue for
      commercial, and so on), with different kinds of shapes. The player has to clear the tray, placing the blocks in
      the available locations on the city's map, or else it will become full and breaks. The blocks can be rotated
      (using the right mouse button) to better fit the map.

      Each level has a collection of goals, usually filling a certain portion of the map (20% in the game's start) and
      constructing certain kinds of structures (like 2x2 residential blocks). Some maps have highlighted areas with
      specific colors to build on, and those must also be filled.

      When 2x2 blocks of the same kind are built, the player earn power-ups. The main ones are the recycler, which
      changes the shape of a given set of blocks; the trash can, where the player can put unwanted pieces; and the
      bulldozer, which allows the player to destroy blocks already built. Those three, when earned, are added to
      specific counter. Other kinds of power-ups are accumulated below the conveyor belt, such as: the hammer, which
      breaks every set in the conveyor to one block sets; the spray can, which randomly recolors all sets in the
      conveyor belt; the dynamite, which makes all sets in the conveyor explode; the clock, which stops time for 3
      seconds; the snail, which slows down the conveyor belt for a while, etc.

      There are two play modes, Story and Untimed, and a total of 48 cityscapes.</story>

    <story>Puzzle Kingdoms is a RPG game using tile matching mini-games as the combat system of the battles, in a
      similar fashion to Puzzle Quest, another puzzle-based RPG with fantasy themes released in 2007 by the same
      developers. Instead of swapping adjacent tiles to create groups of three or more like in the earlier title, the
      main gameplay mechanic this time is to move columns and rows to match tiles.

      The player controls a hero character, moving between waypoints in an isometric map similar to the ones found on
      the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade and
      defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically after winning
      a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.

      The battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting
      armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the combatants take turns trying
      to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy
      when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to
      unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when
      three or more of them are lined up on the grid.

      The troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with
      the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful
      strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots
      below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter
      statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of their colors.

      New troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines, taverns,
      dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on a set number
      of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges. Completing these bonus
      stages gives new items and upgrades.</story>

    <story>Puzzler Collection is a collection of thousands of puzzles in four categories: Fitword, Crossword, Sudoku and
      Wordsearch. In Fitword, the words shown must be placed in a grid. In Crossword, clues are given and the player
      must input the word that matches the description. In Sudoku, numbers are placed in a grid in such a way that no
      duplicates occur horizontally and vertically. In Wordsearch, the words shown have to be crossed out in a grid of
      letters.

      There are several game modes and difficulty levels to choose from. The Nintendo DS is held like a book during
      gameplay, and the player can either play lefthanded or righthanded (which determines on which side the player
      holds the Touch Screen).

      The game has five game modes which include:

      1. Simply Puzzle, this lets the player pick any type of puzzle for a quick challenge without keeping score.
      2. Quick Blast, which offers a number of puzzles based on the amount of time the player has. This can be set to
      show up daily, for instance for a daily bus trip.
      3. Fast &amp; Fun, which adds a timer to increase pressure on the player.
      4. Head to Head, a two-player challenge.
      5. Tournament, in which the player solves a series of puzzles increasing in difficulty from Easy to Pro.

      In the European version, all puzzles are localized.</story>

    <story>Quiz Taxi is based on the German TV show of the same name. In the show passengers entering a perfectly
      harmless-looking taxi cab suddenly find themselves in a quiz show. The cab is rigged with cameras and the driver
      acts as the quiz master. The candidates have time to answer questions and win money until they reach their
      destination. After three wrong answers, however, the ride ends prematurely and they have to look for another cab.
      To make things a little easier two jokers are available. The candidates can either make a phone call or ask the
      driver to stop and ask a random pedestrian for help.

      The Nintendo DS game works almost exactly like the TV show. There are different cities and routes to choose from.
      Completing all routes in a city will unlock the next city. This does not really influence the game, however, as
      the taxi travelling to its destination simply acts as a time limit for the quiz game. The quiz itself is a simple
      multiple choice dialog with three possible answers for each question. Just like in the TV show the player can use
      jokers to get answers to more difficult questions - and just like in real life these answers are not always
      correct. At random points the taxi may have to stop at a red light and this gives the player the chance to win
      back a joker by winning a mini game like Memory, Hot Wire or a spelling game.

      There are also two wireless multiplayer modes. In "Team Mode" up to three player vote on a team answer and win or
      lose together. In "Combat Mode" up to three players ride separate taxis and try to win the most money within the
      time limit.</story>

    <story>Bubby and Bobby return in this Nintendo DS update to the popular arcade game, Rainbow Islands. The game takes
      place several years after Bubble Bobble, and the brothers now have the ability to create rainbows to destroy their
      enemies. However, they'll need this ability, as the residents of the seven Rainbow Islands have been imprisoned,
      and need to be rescued!

      The DS version of Rainbow Islands functions differently from the original. Your character is now floating inside a
      bubble on the touch screen, and the levels can be seen both on the top and touch screens. You can drag your
      character around the screen by touching them with the stylus, or you can drag the stylus elsewhere on-screen to
      create a rainbow. If you tap a drawn rainbow, it will fall down vertically, killing any enemies underneath.

      Finally, there are two special rainbows that can be drawn if you hold the L or R buttons, each with their own
      special function. Drawing a circle will create a large bubble which you can drag around the screen and hit other
      enemies with; while drawing a triangle will create a kind of black hole that will suck in enemies, allowing you to
      take them out in one go. Lastly, there is a special rainbow that can only be drawn when your 'Star Gauge' is full:
      when it is, this gauge can be tapped, and the player is given a short time to draw a five-pointed star (similar to
      the 'Healing Touch' in Trauma Center). If successful, all enemies on both screens will be destroyed.

      In addition to this new style of play, there is also a 'Score Mode'. In this mode, you only have one life, and
      must earn as many points as possible as a barrage of enemies continues to attack you. The game also has two secret
      characters to unlock, as well as a Versus Mode where players compete to reach the top of the level first. The
      special rainbows are not available in either of these modes.</story>

    <story>Red Bull BC One is a Nintendo DS game based on a break dancing competition with the same name. It's a mix of
      a rhythm action game and a puzzle game where players get to compete against different break dancers from around
      the world.

      Before starting the game players gets to design their own dancer. This is done in the dressing room where the
      players can customize their characters in different categories. It's possible to choose different body styles,
      hairstyles and clothing. Playing the career mode will let players unlock more clothing that their character can
      use.

      The actual gameplay consists of performing different dance moves. These moves are shown on the top screen and are
      done by playing a simple connect the dots puzzle game on the lower screen. Dots of different colour are shown
      across the screen and the player has to create shapes by connecting at least three dots of the same colour using
      the stylus. For each turn the player need to create as many shapes as possible before the time runs out. There is
      also special star shaped dots. If these are included in a shape the player will perform special moves and gain
      more points. It's also possible to create perfects, which is the largest possible shape of the turn. By creating
      multiple perfects the player will gain multipliers that will multiply the overall score.

      There's a couple of game modes. The main one is the career mode where players get to battle against different
      b-boys with the goal to reach the final of the Red Bull BC One competition. There's also the free mode where
      players can improve their scores of a specific battle. The game also has a multiplayer mode where players can
      compete against friends in a one-on-one battle via multi card play.</story>

      game that comes out. His obsession has spawned a digital version himself within his own Nintendo DS. This digital
      version of himself has come to be known as "Game Master Arino", who haunts gamers around the world with retro game
      challenges. You have been chosen by Game Master Arino, and are now trapped in the 1980s until you can defeat his
      game challenges.

      Retro Game Challenge, based on the Japanese TV show Game Center CX, has you playing faithfully-recreated clones of
      popular NES-era games, attempting to complete challenges and freeing yourself from Game Master Arino. You are
      accompanied by Arino himself as a young lad, who will cheer you on as you're playing each game. You can also read
      the latest gaming mags for tips, cheats, and previews of upcoming titles.

      There are eight games total, each modeled after 8-bit classics such as Galaga (Cosmic Gate), Dragon Warrior
      (Gaudia Quest), and Ninja Jajamaru-kun (Robot Ninja Haggle Man). Each game has multiple challenges from Arino to
      complete, such as clearing a certain stage or earning a set number of points, and can also be played in a free

    <story>Get ready to feel the rhythm! Rhythm Heaven is a game based entirely around musical rhythm and timing. The
      game is a collection of games based around a song, where the player must perform actions in time to the music to
      successfully complete the game. All games are based around the simple motions of tapping, sliding and flicking the
      stylus.

      As each game varies from each other, at the start of each game, you're given a brief tutorial to get the hang of
      how the game you'll be playing works. Tasks for games include (but are not limited to) flicking to construct
      machinery, releasing the stylus at the right time to belt out a loud note, sliding to rub a lizard's tail in time
      to a mating dance beat, tapping to gulp down dumplings, tapping and flicking to harvest vegetables and get rid of
      moles, and more. After every four games, a special "remix" game appears, which combines the previous games into a
      hectic mix, where you never know what will be up next.</story>

    <story>Ridge Racer DS is a remake of Ridge Racer 64 with some changes and additions. All the same levels are there,
      but there are plenty of new cars, including Namco- and Nintendo-themed vehicles. There is also some new music that
      was not in the N64 version.

      The Touch Screen on the Nintendo DS is put to use all throughout the game, including navigation through every menu
      and even a revolutionary new control where the player steers the steering wheel with the stylus or thumb ring.

      Another addition to the game is the use of the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi capabilities. Using wireless communication, up
      to 6 players can race against each other. In fact, up to 6 players can play with a Game Card in only one of the
      systems. The other 5 players don't even need the game. There will be more items, such as cars, available to play
      with if all of the systems have a Ridge Racer DS Game Card in though. So there is an advantage to having multiple
      Game Cards.</story>

    <story>Based on the Blue Sky film (distributed by Fox) of the same name,
      Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot City to meet
      Big Weld, the famous inventor, he finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing and the evil Ratchet has
      taken over Big Weld Industries. With the help of his friends the Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet's
      villainous ways and restores order to the city.

      Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the player to
      locations from the movie like Robot City, Big Weld's Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame Gasket's Chop Shop. Using
      the invention mode, players build and upgrade Rodney's weapons including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper,
      and magno grenade. With a combination of navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players can make their way though
      the world of Robots and bring an end to Ratchet's tyranny.

      In addition to the main story line, players will find robots in need all over the city. The parts these poor
      robots are missing can be found hidden in the numerous maps and returning the correct part rewards the player with
      power-ups and weapon upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so players can easily find their way back to a
      previous area to uncover additional secrets.The maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, just like the
      transit system in the movie.

      The DS version of the game features a map that can be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of the transit
      ball game that utilizes the stylus for control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new features, the DS also
      includes high resolution maps that include more detail than the GBA version.</story>

    <story>In Rune Factory 2 the player, Kyle by default, is an amnesiac who wanders into the town of Alvarna and is
      discovered by a girl named Mana.

      Like in the first Rune Factory game, the gameplay is a mix of the farming found in the Harvest Moon series and
      battling. The player must grow and maintain crops and build up their home, and there are also dungeons to battle
      and befriend monsters in. The stamina of your character still depends on the meter of rune points, and once it is
      depleted it will start draining the meter of health points.

      The player will marry a potential girl in the town and have child with her, the gender of the child will be of the
      player's choosing. Unlike the Harvest Moon games, the player will then continue playing as the child which is an
      integral part of the game's plot. At the point the goal of the game is to build a school, a goal left behind by
      Kyle one night when he left home.</story>

    <story>A DS remake of Final Fantasy Legend III tells the story of a great flood which destroys cities in the past,
      present and future. As you control a party of 4, with a choice of human and mutant classes, and travel back and
      forth through time collecting pieces of the great ship Talon so as to defeat the enemy that has flooded the lands.
      nn The inclusion of a time travel storyline means that whatever you do in one time frame can have an affect on
      what happens in another time. Other major changes compared to the original 2 in the series are the ability to
      mutate your characters further and a change to the upgrade system. Items picked up after battle can be attached to
      your mutants or humans to turn them into monsters or robots, increasing your parties power and abilities. And
      although the original system of obtaning experience points after every battle has been removed, its replacement
      allows you to choose which magic stone each character can use, so they learn that specific magic type and never
      lose it.</story>

      Sally's Salon is a time management game where customers file in through the door desiring a variety of
      beautification services. These include hair washing, coloring, cutting, styling, drying, and eyebrow styling.
      Customers indicate what service they want next with a pictorial balloon above their heads. The player must guide
      them to the appropriate station in the salon and service the customer. The customers must have their needs met in
      a timely manner or else their satisfaction meters (measured in hearts) will decrease along with prospective tips.
      Customers will eventually leave if they are dissatisfied enough.

      Between days at the beauty shop, Sally can use her profits to purchase upgrades for the beauty shop such as more
      stations, faster equipment, and waiting area amenities for keeping the customers patient. Sally can also hire
      assistants to staff various stations, thereby lessening her own burden.</story>

    <story>Scribblenauts is a side-scrolling action game based on puzzles. The goal is to have the character Maxwell
      overcome obstacles by summoning objects based on a dictionary of more than 20.000 words, partly based on the
      concept of the real-life game Mad Libs. This is done by writing an object's name on the touchscreen, letter by
      letter. When the word is recognized, the object spawns in the world, where it can be manipulated or act on its
      own. This leads to an endless amount of possibilities to progress through the game. For instance, when an item
      needs to be retrieved from a tree, you could summon a ladder to get it out, a football to hit it, or just a
      helicopter or an albatross to fly over there. There are also more bizarre examples, such as summoning a time
      machine, going back in time to fetch a dinosaur egg, make it hatch and then use it in the future to defeat an army
      of robot zombies. The list also includes weapons, historical people, and even references to popular cultures and
      internet memes. Profanity and trademarked objects are not recognized. There is also a spelling checker included to
      offer suggestions.

      This game is a logical sequel to the gameplay mechanics of Drawn to Life, an earlier title by 5TH Cell, relying on
      the same concept of emergent gameplay, where the actual game is more of a toolbox, shaped through the player's
      interaction and different in each session. During the game Maxwell needs to collect starites. To do this, two to
      four objects are often summoned at the same time. There are general, slow puzzle levels, but also faster action
      levels filled with enemies, platforms, switches and traps. Often, the summoned objects and characters need to
      interact with each other. Players can earn "merits" for not using weapons in a level for instance and finding a
      more creative approach. When a level is completed, a silver star is awarded and the Free Play mode for the level
      is unlocked. When the level is then completed three more times, using a different approach each time, a gold star
      is provided.

      By solving puzzles, Ollars are awarded, the game's currency. It can be exchanged for different avatars or visual
      changes. The game includes a level editor and support for Wi-Fi to share the levels. The existing levels can also
      be edited and the way certain summoned objects interact with each other can also be modified.</story>

      allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related
      to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either
      humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner.

      Version differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control
      modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic
      Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions.

      Each character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example,
      Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point,
      making it difficult to return.

      Minigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House
      of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier
      game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.</story>

    <story>The Settlers is a remake of The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici for the Nintendo DS.

      The premise of the game is set to ancient Rome, with you taking control of the Romans in the main campaign, or
      additionally the Vikings, Nubian and Asian empires in Free Play mode.

      The game works very differently from most general strategy games. Your goal is to reach the gateway at the end of
      each map, usually hidden amidst the enemy lines. You must build military buildings to expand your borders that you
      can reach the resources that are initially out of your reach. Eventually reaching the gateway to proceed onto the
      next level. Your city needs roads to optimize the trade routes and allow different buildings to get the resources
      they need for production.

      The game is highly based on gathering resources and optimizing the roads to provide maximal resource gathering. In
      example, you need a woodcutter to provide a sawmill with logs in order for the builders to build new structures
      and harbors to build ships for your expeditions.

      The game is almost a 1:1 recreation of the original Settlers II game, but it adds few new things to the game such
      as new music and new GUI to support the stylus.</story>

    <story>Named after the television boxing program airing on the US Showtime cable network, this game offers a mix of
      fourteen heavyweights and welterweights and four arenas to fight in (New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and
      Chicago). Basic moves include upper block, body block, dodging left and right, short punches and powered punches
      (hook, jab, uppercut, bodyshot). While playing, there are a few parameters to take into account. First there is a
      health meter that recharges when the boxer dodges hits for some time. Punches need to be thrown strategically, as
      an energy bar determines the effectiveness. Too many punches deplete the bar and the amount also determines if a
      boxer will be able to get up when knocked down. A round timer and knockdown lights are also shown. At certain
      times, a power-up indicator will become available. This allows a boxer to charge a heavy punch, but the opponent
      will have time to react. When the charging takes too long, the punch is lost.

      The different game modes (different for heavyweight and welterweight) include:

      1. Single Fights (Quick): fight for only one round until one of the boxers is knocked out.

      2. Single Fights (Regular): play for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rounds and choose to decide it by a KO, TKO or by points.

      3. Points System: after each round each boxer is awarded points based on performance. At the end of a fight, or
      after a KO or TKO, the player with the most points wins.

      4. Belts: series of three (Amateur), four (Contender) or six (Showtime) fights. Each fight lasts four rounds or
      three minutes and the aim is to win one of the belts.

      5. King of the Ring: one boxer takes on all other boxers in his weight division in one long round.

      Additional fighters are unlocked by winning competitions. Most of the modes can also be played with two players
      through a wireless connection (DS).</story>

    <story>SimCity DS brings the classic series to the handheld consoles.

      As the Mayor placed in charge of running their own city, players use the touchscreen to build up and run their
      town, providing commercial, residential and industrial zones, protection against crime and fire, entertainment
      areas and even airports, highways and railways for the SimCitizens to travel.

      Players also have to contend with natural (and unnatural) disasters, the pressures of an ever-expanding city, and
      of course, public opinion, which can make a job very difficult if things get out of control.

      New to this version is the inclusion of wireless communication with other Mayors via a Post Office. Players can
      send letters to each other, giving a short summary of the state of their city. When players send letters to each
      other, they earn special monuments for their cities. Additionally, when disaster strikes, the Mayor can take a
      more hands-on approach in directly rescuing their SimCitizens.</story>

    <story>When Bart finds a mysterious game manual, he realizes that he and his family have become the main characters
      of the newest hit video game -- The Simpsons Game!

      Each of the Simpsons are playable in this sidescroller action game and feature their own wacky, special abilities.
      Homer can transform into a large blob and roll his way through levels. Bart can don a cowl and cape and become
      Bartman, using his slingshot and gliding ability to overcome the game's goons. Lisa can use an all-touchscreen
      Hand of Buddha to solve puzzles and remove obstacles from her path, and Marge can control mobs to overwhelm anyone
      who stands in her way.

      Each of the game's twelve episodes parodies some bit of precious popular culture, including spoofs of such classic
      videogames as Frogger, Space Invaders, Pokémon, and Madden. The game is chock full of video and voice overs
      featuring the original cast and written by the show writers. The voices, story, and cutscenes means the game's
      irreverent humor include plenty of references for Simpsons fanatics who will catch all the inside jokes from old
      episodes.

      Exclusive to the DS game is "Pet Homer," a sort of virtual pet game where the player collects various items to
      feed to Homer (and watch the crazy outcome), as well as several multiplayer minigames.</story>

    <story>Slingo Quest is a progression of Slingo games; Slingo is a combination of slot machines and Bingo. The player
      is presented with a Bingo-style card (usually 5x5 squares) and is given a certain number of spins. Each spin
      triggers 5 wheels to spin, one corresponding to each column. The player then marks off squares on the card if they
      contain numbers from the spin. Jokers can also show up during spins which allow the player to mark off any square
      from the column.

      Players can get extra points for various feats, such as clearing the entire card. Different cards have different
      Slingo patterns highlighted in red that are worth extra points if the player marks every square. Sometimes, slots
      can produce devils that take a percentage of the player's accumulated treasure (though the treasure might be safe
      if the player has demon protection).

      Further, there are bonus rounds to be played against a pirate where a lot of treasure is at stake. The player and
      the pirate take turns spinning on the same board. Occasionally, a treasure chest pops up which may contain
      treasure or it may confiscate treasure. The player that discovers the chest has right of first refusal-- they can
      choose to open it or make the other player open it.

      Other rounds present the player with a 7x7 game board, instead of a 5x5 board. Some rounds have 2, 3, or 4 5x5
      boards that are played concurrently.</story>

      The Sokoban DS version contains a total of 250 levels of varying difficulty and has full usage of DS 3D graphics,

      other characters include Miles "Tails" Prower, Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Knuckles the Echidna. Each playable
      character has four moves as well as a variety of "Trick actions" which, when performed, will raise your Tension
      Gauge. Filling the gauge allows you to do a Boost which will propel Sonic or Blaze at a high speed across the
      ground or along the air to defeat enemies or move certain blocks.There are 14 levels that play out over both the
      top and bottom DS screens, giving you a bigger view of your surroundings. You will race through the levels
      collecting rings, using "gimmicks" such as bungee ropes and giant waterwheels, performing tricks, collecting
      power-ups, and defeating enemies. When you beat each level, or "act", you will face a Boss Act which is played out
      over the top screen in 3D. In addition to these levels, there are Special Stages. These are played on the touch
      screen, and unlike the rest of the game, feature control with the stylus. Upon completion of the game, Time Attack
      mode will be available. In it, you play levels/boss acts for the best time record. Battle Play is a multiplayer
      mode in which two players compete to finish a level first. It can be played over single-card download or
      multi-card wireless.</story>

    <story>While flying in their plane across the ocean, looking for a strange energy source, Sonic and Tails' plane is
      struck by lightning! They plunge into the murky depths of the ocean...and awaken on a small island. A local, a
      raccoon named Marine, informs them that they are on Southern Island. With Marine and Tails' help, Sonic sets about
      to explore the nearby islands.

      Sonic Rush Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure game, and the sequel to Sonic Rush. Sonic's goal through these
      platform levels is to zip through as quickly as possible. By pressing the B Button while in the air, Sonic can
      increase his Tension Gauge by performing aerial tricks. Pressing Y uses a Super Boost, which will allow him to
      plow through anything in his path at amazing speed, but drains the Tension Gauge.

      When Sonic reaches the treasure chest at the end of each level, he will be given a material that can be used for
      construction of ships and other devices. At first, Sonic is stranded on Southern Island, but after the
      construction of the waterbike, he can travel to other islands and explore them. Similar to The Legend of Zelda:
      Phantom Hourglass, the player must plot a path to the next island using the stylus, and then provide limited
      control over the ship as it travels. However, Sonic has different ships, each of which are notably different from
      Link's steamboat.

      Sonic Rush Adventure also features a Battle Mode, where players can either play locally with a friend, or across
      the world through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Players can take each other on in a one-on-one race through various
      levels as each player aims to get to the end first.</story>

    <story>Soul Bubbles is very similar to Bubble Ghost and requires the player to save lost Spirits by transporting
      them in bubbles to the exit of each level.

      The player takes over the role of a Spirit Herder who is tasked with ferrying souls to the underworld. To move the
      Spirits and keep them relatively save, they need to be be enclosed in soup bubbles. The Spirit Herder then can
      blow those bubbles through the level, deflate them if they are too big and even cut them into two bubbles and
      rejoin them later when required. If a bubble bursts, the Spirit will slowly suffocate and eventually die if the
      player can't draw a new bubble around it fast enough.

      But the way to the Gateway Cube isn't an easy one and it's not just as simple as blowing the bubbles from start to
      finish in the 40 levels. Besides the natural dangers in form of rocks, plants or hungry critters that all destroy
      the bubble, there are also environment puzzles waiting to be solved like activating a switch which requires a big
      bubble. There is also Star Dust and so-called Calabash waiting to be collected. While the Star Dust will increase
      the light emitted by the Spirits and can be collected by simply drawing a new bubble around it, the Calabashs are
      well hidden but once the player found them all, he will unlock the eighth World called Agartha, the Land of the
      Dead.

      To help with the search, the Spirits will change their shape to heart if a Calabash is near or turn into yellow
      triangles if there is imminent danger.</story>

    <story>The pixelated aliens are back to celebrate their 30th anniversary!

      Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978
      classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync
      with the onscreen action.

      Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming
      fleet of invaders before they reach the ground. The main objective is to get as many points as possible before
      running out of lives.

      Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right
      descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player
      to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

      Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other. The Nintendo
      DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</story>

      strange distress call. They find the wreckage of an ancient escape pod. Its inhabitant is in cryogenic sleep and
      when revived tells them about a terrible new threat: the Krawl. The Krawl are an alien lifeform who consume whole
      planets, and they have already been spotted in this part of the galaxy.

      Fortunately, there is a way to defeat them. This requires the help of an extinct lifeform called Spectrobes.
      Rallen and Jeena must visit planets to find fossils of these Spectrobes, excavate, awaken and train them. There
      are almost 500 different ones for the player to collect and trade. To excavate a Spectrobe, the player must first
      locate it using another Spectrobe. Using the stylus on the touch-screen, one can carefully remove layers of rock
      and soil to dig up the fossil, without damaging it.

      The fossil must then be taken back to the space ship, put in a machine and awakened by using your voice or blowing
      in the microphone. The soil also contains various crystals and minerals, which can be used to feed and train the
      Spectrobes. They will evolve to stronger and more effective stages.

      The Krawl are on the planets in the form of vortexes. Walking too close to them triggers a battle, in which two
      Spectrobes join Rallen against the enemy. With a combination of buttons and shoulderbuttons the Spectrobes can
      unleash special attack powers or combine their respective attacks in real time action.

      Via WiFi and on a dedicated website players can battle against each other or exchange Spectrobes and items.
      Special collectibles can be downloaded. Items and Spectrobes can also be added to the game using game cards with
      holes through which the touch-screen must be touched in a specific order.</story>

    <story>Based off the 2007 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 3 puts players in charge of the titular hero as he
      tries to once again New York City safe from the combined menace of the New Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom.

      This version of the game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D stylized elements. The action is primarily
      controlled using the touch screen. Players use the stylus for combat, webbing, and item interaction. The game also
      allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man
      villains from the comic book mythos.

      One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When
      Spider-Man's "Rage" meter builds up, the black suit automatically takes over, allowing Spider-Man to become
      faster, aggressive, and more powerful.</story>

    <story>While exploring the thought-to-be-long-abandoned palace of the Ancient Demon King, the young thief Anise
      stumbles upon a startling discovery: the palace isn't abandoned at all, and it's crawling with demons, no less!
      Equally startling is the deadly booby trap she triggers in the process of opening a locked door. She barely
      outruns the giant boulder bearing down on her, escaping the palace only to fall into a surging river, unconscious.
      The fairy Kukri, imprisoned for centuries in the chamber Anise inadvertently unlocked, rescues her and takes her
      to the Castle of Albyon. Anise awakens in the presence of the King, whose son is being held by demons in the very
      palace Anise narrowly escaped from. Recent events have unshakably convinced the King that this thief is descended
      from the Legendary Hero of Albyon, he who slew the Ancient Demon King centuries ago, and so he commands her
      thusly: free the Prince from the vile demons... or be tried and convicted as a thief and locked away for life.

      the first adventure, and remains a mix of role-playing, tactics and action. The choice of the character and his

    <story>The third game in the Collapse! series has the same core gameplay as previous games but features several new
      modes including for the first time a quest mode. The following eight game modes are available:

      1. Classic

      Quest

      Relapse

      Strategy

      Puzzle

      Slider

      Continuous

      Countdown

      Initially, only classic and quest modes are available. The rest can be unlocked by playing the quest mode. The
      classic mode works in the same way as in previous games. The player is presented with a grid that is partially
      filled with coloured blocks. More blocks are added to grid, one row at a time, from the bottom of the grid. The
      aim of the game is to remove these blocks before they reach the top of the screen. To remove blocks the player
      simply clicks a group of three or more like coloured blocks. Some special pieces exists such as bombs that blows
      up surrounding blocks.

      In the quest mode the player enters a strange world where he progresses from level to level. For each level that
      is completed a new is made available. The quest mode features a store where the player can purchase different
      things for the money he earns for completing each level. For more money it's also play different casino mini games
      such as slot machines. All of the game modes are available in the quest mode and after a number of them have been
      completed they become unlocked for the player to play at any time.

      The relapse mode works like classic but new blocks come in from both top and bottom. In the strategy mode new
      block will only come in when the player clicks. In the puzzle mode the player has to clear all blocks from the
      screen and no new appear. In the slider mode the rows of blocks will slide left and right so that the groups
      changes. The continuous mode is an endless variant of the classic mode and the player has to last as long as
      possible. In the countdown mode the player has to score as many points as possible in two minutes.</story>

      comics.
      The main campaign gives you a hexagonal map of Metropolis which pinpoints your location as well as your current
      enemy's location and any disaster areas he may have caused. Since Superman himself is invulnerable, Metropolis
      itself has a health bar that keeps track of just how much damage the city is enduring, and which measures your
      level of success/failure.Your objective thus is to move around the map each turn to try and take control of each
      disaster area which triggers a timed 3rd person perspective sequence in which you control Superman as he flies
      through the city and uses his powers to solve whatever task is at hand (blowing out fires with his super-breath,
      destroying mind-control beacons with his heat vision, saving people, etc. etc.) catching up with your enemies
      triggers a fight sequence in which you must input the correct button-presses on cue to defeat your opponents. In
      between these rounds story segments that follow the movie's plot play out, which involve a unique 3D action
      sequence that mimics the movie's counterpart.

      Features a single-player campaign as well as two wireless multiplayer modes in which you can face-off against four
      other Supermen in unique disaster areas to see who gets to clear the objectives faster than the rest. Also
      includes a gallery of Superman comic covers that are unlocked by collecting Krypton crystals in the game.</story>

    <story>Surf's Up is based on the 2007 animated film of the same name, featuring surfing penguins and wacky hijinks.

      Surf's up for DS and PSP is a racing game that brings the player through an interesting adventure featuring all
      the characters from the CGI movie.

      The player can choose from a bunch of the movie characters and compete in races against other movie characters.
      Each character has their own specific skills and their own surf boards. The different levels/races contain
      jumps/ramps which enables the player to perform tricks using either the stylus to draw objects (DS) or repeating a
      button sequence (PSP). Performing tricks will give you a speed boost which might just help you finish the race
      first and move on to the next round.

      The levels also contain shortcuts and the race track is populated with different objects that can be used to gain
      a speed boost, distract or hit opponents and ultimately will help you finish the race first.

      The game also offers a multi-player mode which enables you to play with friends who have the game and even friends
      who don't have the game (but have a console).</story>

      in this case it is known as 'Yokai Great Decisive Battle mode', and features a RPG-style gameplay. In Yokai Great
      Decisive Battle mode, the player controls Don in a RPG gameplay. When the player encounters an enemy, the taiko
      drum battle starts.
      Like in Great Adventure of the Seven Islands, the player must hit the notes to deplete the enemy's health point,
      otherwise missing a note will deplete the player's HP. The player wins when the enemy's HP is completely depleted.
      Players can level up by gaining EXP via taiko drum battles. When leveling up, Don's HP, attack and defense stats
      will increase. Equipments such as head gears and clothes will also affect stats as well. In addition, some head
      gears like the bronze key can unlock special doors, depending on the type of door in question.</story>

      similar to Tales of Rebirth. Enemies and allies are all on 3 lines, with the player switching between them at
      will. The Touch Screen may be used for special attacks never before seen in the Tales series, allowing lots more
      variety in battle. The big feature of this game is the ability for certain characters to transform into
      werewolves, gaining extra power and speed at the cost of techniques.</story>

    <story>In Tao's Adventure: Curse of the Demon Seal, the player controls the young Air Speller by the name of Tao.
      When his village gets attacked by Ancient Monsters, he is sent by the council over to the town of Mondominio to
      seek the help of a friend of his father. Mondominio is famous for containing the Monster Tower which was sealed
      for many years until a lightning storm hit the tower and broke the seal.

      The game plays quite similarly to Azure Dreams. Most of it is based around leveling up, learning new spells, and
      collecting monster eggs from the monster tower, and then selling them in town or hatching them as pets that will
      aid you in your quest. The player begins with the basic elemental spells which are cast using the DS stylus. The
      battles, movements, and almost any action taken in the monster tower is turn-based. The higher the player
      progresses up the tower levels, the stronger the enemies become. With every five levels of the tower, the player
      will encounter a boss.</story>

      slightly isometric camera angle. The game can be played alone with a CPU ally or with a friend wirelessly with a
      selection of the four turtles, each with their own varying stats. Also much like Smash Up, while the game tries to
      blend both the new and the old TMNT universe all into one it leans a lot more heavily toward the new with its

    <story>At its base, Tetris DS is the same Tetris gameplay that's been around for years: rotate and arrange
      Tetriminos to create full lines and make them disappear. However, it also has a style very different from earlier
      Tetris games, new play modes, and online play.

      Graphically and aurally, Tetris DS is based on classic NES games. A portion of the graphics are sprites directly
      ripped from Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, Metroid, Yoshi's
      Cookie, and The Legend of Zelda. Remixes of music from these games are also used.

      Standard mode includes the standard endless play option, the standard "get 25 lines to win" option, and the
      standard versus mode where clearing multiple lines at once adds lines to the bottom of your opponents' well.

      Push mode is a versus game with a twist. The player's moves and pieces are shown on the top screen, while the
      opponent's are on the bottom screen, both with gravity moving towards the center. Instead of multiple line clears
      adding extra lines to the bottom of your opponent's well, though, the center is pushed towards their end, giving
      them a smaller play area. Push back and forth until one side loses.

      Touch mode presents you with a tall uneven stack of large Tetriminos. The goal is to nudge or rotate them by
      dragging or tapping on the touch screen to create full lines and eventually clear the stack.

      Puzzle mode offers 200 Tetris scenarios and presents you with a number of pieces. You choose the order and
      rotation of the pieces to try and empty the well.

      Mission mode gives you specific goals like "Use a square block to clear a line" or "Clear 3 lines with an L
      piece". Finish the mission and you'll be given another. Don't finish the mission and several rows of random blocks
      will be added to the bottom of the well before being given another mission.

      Catch mode has the Tetriminos falling without direct player control. Instead, the player controls a moving core of
      blocks which can rotate as a whole, as well as latch on to the falling Tetriminos. The goal is to create a square
      of at least 4x4, causing an explosion which keeps the size of your core small. Lose by allowing your core to get
      too large, or by losing enough energy; which occurs when you allow a Tetrimino to scroll past the bottom of the
      screen, your rotating core smacks into and destroys a Tetrimino, or you hit a falling enemy.

      Multiplayer Standard, Mission, and Push modes can be played locally using one copy of Tetris DS. Mission allows
      for up to 10 players competing for a high score. Standard allows for up to 10 players, and has an option for Mario
      Kart-like items to aid you or harm your enemies. Push mode remains a one-on-one experience. With Nintendo Wi-Fi
      Connection, you can play a two-player Standard game without items, a four-player Standard game with items, or a
      two-player Push mode game.</story>

    <story>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The
      first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally
      leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the
      park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can
      design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

      Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will
      combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything
      running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

      You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in
      attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure
      that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

      It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and
      Full add more strategic features.</story>

    <story>Tiger Woods PGA Tour is the first game in the long running golf series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game
      features a Quick Play mode and a Legends Tour mode. In the Quick Play mode the player gets to play single matches
      either alone or against three opponents. Five authentic courses and one fantasy course are available in the game
      and the player can choose to play stroke play, match play or skins. The Legends Tour allows the player to take on
      the best players from around the world. The player starts out on the Rookie Tour but by earning Tour Cards the Pro
      and Legend Tours are unlocked. By completing events on the tours the player earns cash that can be used to upgrade
      the golfer's attributes.

      The game features an analog control method using the touch screen of the DS. Before taking the shot the player is
      presented with a top down overview of the course that allows the player to adjust his aim. Once that is done two
      meters appear on the touch screen. One is u-shaped and controls the swing. The power of the shot is determined by
      how the player draws the stylus on the right side of the meter while the left side determines how straight the
      shot gets. There is also a boost meter that has to be rubbed repeatedly to add some distance to the shot. Once the
      ball is in the air the player can influence its rotation by dragging the stylus in the right direction.

      Multiplayer exists for up to four players through wireless communication. All players can play the game
      simultaneously so no-one has to wait for their turn.</story>

    <story>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is the second game in the series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game features
      touch swing controls where the player drags the stylus downwards to backswing and then back upwards again to
      shoot. A smooth motion leads to a more accurate shot, while the power of the shot is determined by how long the
      backswing is and the speed of the motion. At the same time the accuracy of the shot is determined by the angle of
      the swing. By sliding the stylus right or left, the ball may draw or fade although too much will lead to a hook or
      a slice. Once the ball is in the air, a close-up image of it appears on the bottom screen. By sliding the stylus
      repeatedly across the ball, the player is able to make it rotate.

      A more traditional tap control is also available. With it the player swings by pressing a button to begin a
      backswing. The swing meter bar will then increase until the player presses the button again to decide the power of
      the shot. After that the player has to press the button a third time to decide the alignment of the shot.

      The game feature a number of game modes. The play now mode allows the player to play a quick match. The player can
      customize the game by choosing rules (for example stroke play, match play or skins), course and number of holes.
      The courses are eight in total and include for instance Pebble Beach and St. Andrews. Up to four players can
      compete in the play now mode and team play is also an option.

      The practice mode allows the player to try out the game in his own pace without any opponents or other

    <story>In Time Ace, the player takes control of an eccentric inventor, Dr. Hugo Clock, in the year 1914 who invents
      a time machine and travels three years into the future, straight into the first World War. Upset by witnessing
      devastation that the first World War will cause, he is determined to stop it at all costs, however, his
      backstabbing assistant Dr. Klaus Scythe takes the time machine and plans to acquire weapons from the future to
      rule the world for himself and it is up to Dr. Clock to stop him.

      The main idea of the game is to fly in 3-D modeled planes, ranging from World War II fighter planes, to modern day
      jet fighters and up to space fighters of the future. There are 19 levels to explore, picking up various power-ups
      scattered throughout the level to upgrade armor, firepower and speed.

      There is also multiplayer ability using Wi-Fi where players can dogfight head-to-head in the plane of their choice
      or four players can play in a variety of minigames like racing.</story>

    <story>Time Hollow is an interactive novel in the vein of games like Phoenix Wright where the player talks to
      characters and examine areas to find clues and items to help them in their quest.

      The story takes place with the player taking control of a young man by the name of Ethan Kairos, who discovers
      that his family has mysteriously disappeared and sets off to find them. He then comes across a strange looking
      hollow pen and acquires it where he learns its unique and magical property: the ability to open portals to the
      past. Using this pen, the player will take Ethan to the past in search of clues for his family and hopefully
      prevent the awful tragedy.

      The gameplay mostly consists of exploring areas, searching for clues and items and encountering a plethora of
      different characters that can be talked to. Using these items and conversations with the various characters, the
      player must solve puzzles throughout the stages while using the stylus pen to draw portals to link the past and
      present and travel between the time rift.

      Junko Kawano (most notably responsible for the script of some of the Suikoden games, lends his talents for the
      character scripts for the game.</story>

      everything changed. The politics behind the ring got heated, and not in your favor. When you finally claimed the
      title, someone came for you. And now you're here. You've woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in
      Mexico, and you can't remember a thing; your name, what you do, and certainly not why you're here. Lost in a land
      that is not your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner
      goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you've got at getting home. But once
      you're in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot. Punches,
      grapples, throws, and stomps all come naturally, as if you were a seasoned professional... This is where your

    <story>Top Trumps NBA All Stars ties two exciting and successful franchises together and brings them to both the
      Nintendo DS and new 3DS! The game replicates an entire NBA season, complete with the official teams, playoffs and
      All-Star game - played through the medium of a card trading game. Like Top Trumps, the game plays out using cards
      with stats for each player. Take turns picking a stat to beat the corresponding stat on your opponent's card!
      Unlike a conventional game of Top Trumps the rules are tweaked to help replicate a real game of basketball -
      rather than winning cards from your opponent, you rack up points to claim your place at the top!</story>

    <story>After young Mackenzie's father died suddenly, she inherited the family detective agency. Now, with the aid of
      her robotic butler Cromwell and her short but helpful assistant Funghi, she sets out to earn her reputation as the
      Touch Detective. She'll chase down a stolen dream, search for a missing person, and more, as she attempts to
      become well known for her detecting skills.

      Touch Detective is an adventure game in the style of later Sierra adventure games such as Space Quest 6. Players
      navigate Mackenzie through various screens by touching the area where they want her to move. Mackenzie can
      interact with certain on-screen objects with another tap of the stylus - depending on the object, she may look at
      it, pick it up, talk to it (if it can strike up a conversation), or even touch it to see what it feels like.
      Mackenzie likes to feel objects to understand them, which is why she's the 'Touch' Detective. Mackenzie can also
      check and combine objects in her inventory.

      The top screen of the DS always has a close-up of Mackenzie herself. As she talks to other characters, observes
      objects and so forth, the top screen will display Mackenzie's thoughts - so while she may say one thing to a
      person ("Sure, I get it..."), she'll be thinking another ("What was that? I wasn't listening!"). It can be
      interesting (and sometimes insightful) to see the contrast between what Mackenzie says and what she thinks.

      Touch Detective features four different 'cases' for Mackenzie to tackle. After the first case is completed,
      players can also choose to take on the Bonus Case. In this case, there is no main story, but Mackenzie can choose
      to take on small requests from characters, as well as increase her Touch List, which records the feeling of
      particular objects in the game world.</story>

      linking the five main cases, with an extra bonus case containing 30 side quests, making it a much longer game than

      To shoot an enemy, the player taps the stylus on the screen and it is possible to target different body parts.
      Reloading is done through a clip in the bottom right hand corner, and the D-pad and face buttons are used to
      switch weapons. Ammo and health is gathered by shooting crates and the levels feature certain forks with different
      level paths. The available weapons are a handgun, shotgun, submachine gun and crowbar.</story>

    <story>A pure adventure game for the Nintendo DS platform. You play as teen Ashley. Raised by her aunt Jessica,
      Ashley believed both of her parents were dead; on the eve of her 14th birthday, she receives a strange letter and
      a device called a DTS from her father. She and her aunt are summoned to Blood Edward Island, which is where the
      game begins.

      Near the beginning of the game, you meet the ghost of a boy who can't remember his past. Over the course of the
      game, you will uncover the truth of both your own past and this mysterious boy's.

      Much use is made of the unique features of the DS. You will use the stylus, the microphone, and even the "sleep"
      feature in addition to more traditional puzzle solutions. Your character cannot die; there are no action or arcade
      sequences.</story>

    <story>The TrackMania series is now going portable with this Nintendo DS release.

      Race with over 100 tracks by yourself or with your friends. The new modes exclusive to the game are 'Platform', in
      which you must navigate through complex levels without using too many retries, and 'Puzzle', in which you must
      create your own map with checkpoints and a limited number of building blocks to connect the pieces, and race to
      the finish, while the 'Race' mode is left intact. The game includes three environments to race: Desert (the
      environment used in TrackMania Original), Rally and Stadium (the environment used in TrackMania Nations).

      Instead of complex racing simulators where you have to measure a correct speed to turn through narrow roads, this
      is an arcade-style racing game with high speeds (over 400 km/h!) and simple controls. All you have is accelerate,
      brake, horn and that's it! Of course, like it's PC counterparts, you can freely reset the track if you fall of the
      track, or if you want a better medal. There are three types of medals: bronze, silver and gold. You can either
      race with AI opponents or race by yourself. The main objective is to get to the finish line as fast as possible.
      The target time is given to you at the beginning of every track, depending on for which medal you are racing.

      The game also includes a built-in map editor, which allows you to create a custom map with your stylus.</story>

    <story>Transformers: Autobots is the first game of the double movie tie-in for the 2008 movie. In the Autobots
      version players take command of the good guys. The game start outs in the big city where the players learns how to
      control the custom Transformer. Tapping the touchscreen has the transformer change from a quick-moving vehicle
      into a huge robot. The robot form can climb buildings, smash cars or other world objects, fight Decepticons, and
      learn the basics of the mission on earth.

      From there the player completes missions in the city and travels to other locations. By scanning the large number
      of vehicles in the environment it becomes possible to transform into them. Some are just for fun, like the ice
      cream truck, but there are also helicopters and planes.

      Players can compete against your friends, including those who bought Transformers: Decepticons, in several game
      modes in local 4-player multiplayer. Through Nintendo Wi-Fi players complete daily missions to earn points for the
      Autobots side in the battle for the Allspark. Player profiles can be uploaded and looked up on the game's official
      website where other profiles or scores can be checked out or compared.

      Aside from the gameplay mechanics and visual style, the Aubots version is quite different from the Decepticons
      version, with its own characters, missions, focus on situations in the movie and a different conclusion. Unlike
      the console versions the Transformers are initially restricted in their abilities and need to level up to a
      role-playing-like upgrade system. The game's focus is largely on attacking as there are little to no means of
      defence (including blocking), instead there are plenty of health icons.</story>

    <story>Taking players back to the ancient Aztec ruins, The Treasures of Montezuma 2 is a match 3 tile game with
      hidden object elements. The game features the same gameplay and types of power-ups as the first game. However, it
      doesn't have any type of story and presents everything in a slightly different way.

      Players choose a male or female avatar and must begin the game in Adventure mode where the puzzles are grouped
      into 5 chapter stages. The objective in each puzzle is to explode tiles and extract all of the embedded gems
      before time runs out. Groups of three or more identical tiles are created by swapping one from one spot to
      another. That group explodes causing all gems to be "collected" while new tiles fall in from the top to fill in
      the spaces.</story>

    <story>You are a star, a big name on everyone's lips. People all over the country love you and now it's time to take
      the next step in stardom. To become an international superstar you have to travel to Rockopolis, the world capital
      of Rock'n'Roll and win the hearts of the fans across the city.

      Ultimate Band is a game somewhat similar to music games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band. To win over the fans the
      player has to travel to several venues across Rockopolis and play gigs. At each venue the player can talk to the
      fans to see what their preference is, and then play songs accordingly. The main game mechanic is divided into four
      different instruments, all with their own style of play; Lead Guitar, Rhythm Guitar, Bass and Drums. Notes fall
      down from the top screen towards the bottom screen, much like in any other music game. If the instrument is a
      guitar or bass, the player has to pick the right chords with either the D-pad or the face buttons (depending on
      lefty/righty settings) and then strum with the stylus when the notes hit the strum bar. If the instrument picked
      is the drum set, the player has to tap the right drum as the notes fall down the screen.

      The more "buzz" the player earns with the fans, the more venues, songs, instruments and samples are unlocked.

      There is also a recording studio where the player can record a song free-hand, and another recording studio for up
      to four players to simultaneously record a song together via Wi-Fi. The game can hold up to 12 saved custom songs
      and 12 jam sessions.

      The songs featured in the game are all covers of more or less famous songs such as "Rock Lobster" by The B-52's,
      "Take Over, the Break is Over" by Fall Out Boy, "Whip It" by Devo and several others.</story>

    <story>For Ultimate Spider-Man for the DS, developer Vicarious Visions takes the technology and gameplay style of
      their earlier Spider-Man 2 to adapt the storyline of the console version for the handheld.

      Based on the Ultimate Spider-Man comic series, the game follows up on the comic's storyline about Peter Parker's
      childhood friend Eddie Brock and the Venom suit. Three months after his apparent death, Venom roams the streets of
      New York again. Thus Spider-Man must not only deal with the usual assortment of criminals and supervillains but
      also his old friend, while both Trask Industries and S.H.I.E.L.D. have set their sights on Eddie, who struggles to
      take control of the Venom suit. The DS game follows a cut-down version of the console version's storyline, but
      differs a lot in the details. The story is told in comic-style cutscenes that emulate the drawings of series
      artist Mark Bagley and also feature voice acting.

      The game is a 2D side-scroller with real 3D graphics, with the camera moving and rotating to always keep the
      protagonist in view. Players will play as both Spider-Man and Venom, who have different abilities and are
      controlled in fundamentally different ways. Both must beat up various enemies and fight bosses, but other goals
      vary between the two.

      Spider-Man is controlled via a standard button interface, allowing him to jump, swing along his web, punch, kick,
      shoot web balls and use his web to zip to walls and ceilings. When attack moves are stringed into combos, a power
      meter fills up that allows Spidey to unleash a special move that can be selected beforehand from the touch screen.
      His Spider-Sense also comes into play: when in immediate danger, an icon flashes. Pressing the left shoulder
      button within time allows Spider-Man to dodge the attack that follows.

      A large part of Spider-Man's levels consists of rescuing innocents - freeing them from below heavy objects or
      carrying them away from danger. Lifting up the objects requires stroking upwards on the touch screen. The screen
      is also used for modifying electronics or disarming bombs. Lights flash up on a grid: green ones must be touched
      and red ones avoided.

      In contrast, Venom is controlled almost exclusively through the touch screen. Alternate button-based controls are
      available but don't offer the full variety of moves. Venom can attack through either his claws or his tendrils by
      tapping either close or away from him. He can also use his tendrils to pick up objects and enemies and throw them
      around or smash them to the ground, all done through stylus movements. A further use of the tendrils is a targeted
      attack launched by stroking away from Venom in the wanted direction.
      Another gameplay element that only applies to Venom is feeding. The Venom suit drains Eddie's health constantly,
      so he must feed on humans to survive. This is done by simply tapping and holding the intended victim.

      The game features branching paths: at some points, players can choose where to continue with the story (like
      Spider-Man choosing on whether to confront Shocker or the Rhino), leading to different sets of levels.

      A multiplayer mode is also available: it features five different characters and eight arenas for one-on-one
      fights.</story>

    <story>The classic game of Uno comes to the DS with different game modes. Players can customize the entire game
      setup based on the number of players, individual customization, game type, number of cards, alternate cards and
      house rules. The predefined game types include:

      1. Endless: no win conditions and endless rounds. Between each round chips, pot wins, first-out wins and poker
      hand wins are shown.
      2. Chips: earn 50 to 500 to win. Players start with 25 chips and can go into debt.
      3. Uno Wins: win 1 to 10 rounds by going out first.
      4. Poker Wins: win 1 to 10 rounds with a poker hand.
      5. Pot Wins: win the pot in 1 to 10 rounds.
      6. Survival: extra ante based on the number of players still at the table. Players who lose all their chips are
      eliminated.

      There are also four special modes available:

      1. Challenge Mode: play five unique or randomly-generated levels with different win conditions.
      7. Endurance Mode: maximize the score without running out of chips.
      8. Timed Mode: earn as much as possible before time runs out.
      9. Solitaire Mode: play all cards in a twist on the classic Solitaire card game.

      All the classic cards are available as well as the alternate poker rules for cards. Wireless multiplayer is
      supported for up to four players for the DS version, which is generally a port of the GBA release with stretched
      screens and ported sound. The number 52 in the title refers to the included game variation.</story>

      York Police Department in 1976. As the sister of your colleague has been kidnapped, you need to solve both that
      case and a number of others. In between the cases there are shooting and racing mini-games.

      Solving a case is a matter of finding clues at the crime scene, which can be viewed in 3D. By moving the camera up
      and down, you can look under tables or on top of tall closets. Finding certain objects unlocks questions in the
      question list. These questions are a multiple choice quiz. Choosing the wrong answer results in a penalty,
      choosing the right answer will lead to a higher rank. This game is a combination of adventure, action and puzzle.

      Wickie carries a slingshot, but that is not enough to defeat the more powerful enemies. Instead, he must rely on
      tricks and traps such as pushing boulders towards enemy patrols. There are five different game worlds that lead
      Wickie into different corners of Europe. Short cut scenes with the characters from the animated series tell the

      Scratch - Shake things up and drop items on enemies, or just shake them until they're dizzy.
      Split - Alter your environment by cutting a new path yourself.
      Slide - Get a closeup view of the action and add a little extra power to Joe's hits.</story>

    <story>Grab your shovel and tend a virtual garden with Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise! Dig, plant, water and landscape
      in an effort to attract many different species of Piñata in the hope of becoming a master gardener.

      Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise is essentially a handheld version of Viva Piñata with some tweaks and improvements.
      The game features a more streamlined tutorial mode, as well as more tie-ins to the TV show. Video clips from the
      show are given as rewards for completing certain parts of the game. There are also 'Episodes' - mini missions
      where the player must complete a certain task to succeed.

      Of course, there is also the standard mode of play - casually attract Piñata as you see fit, by using different
      plants and other Piñata as incentives. Earn awards for growing plants well, attracting Piñata, and encouraging
      them to romance with others. You can even trade Piñata with friends by using the Wireless connection.</story>

    <story>WALL-E is the video game adaptation of the movie of the same name.

      As the player plays through the levels, they unlock clips from the movie viewable at any time.

      The story mode seems to be altered the character's roles and different from the movie such as WALL-E can commonly
      use its laser, EVE is tasered by AUTO (referenced to WALL-E being tasered in the original.), WALL-E repairing EVE
      (in the original, EVE tries to repair WALL-E), and WALL-E survived from getting crushed by the Holo-Detector. The
      reversal of EVE and WALL-E being damaged was actually intended to occur in the movie, but was later changed.

    <story>This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld devices. At the screen you have a
      5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the
      holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while
      GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.

      The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach
      a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the
      standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush
      one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example
      ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which once active will
      give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are
      available, each with it's own graphical theme.

      The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate
      a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has
      two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so.
      The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles
      will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up.
      However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.

      The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what
      difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.</story>

    <story>Windy X Windam is a 2D-style fighting game based on a Japanese anime series. In the kingdom of Gawain, people
      have the ability to fly using a special force called "Windies." These Windies also grant fighters special powers
      to use in battle. The dual screens of the DS extend the battle arena into the air as players can fly to the top
      screen and take the battle to the sky. Aside from the standard punch, kick and throw commands found in most
      fighting games, players also have powerful "Ultimate techniques" which, when fully charged, unleash a fierce
      attack on the opponent.</story>

    <story>Winter Sports 2009 is the follow-up to Winter Sport 2008. There are two new disciplines: snowboard half-pipe
      and biathlon. Others include curling, skeleton, bobsleigh, alpine skiing and more.

      There is a local multiplayer mode featuring either hot-seat or split screen. Also the game features different
      weather conditions throughout the disciplines, and a physics engine that adds more realism and a more
      action-oriented approach compared to previous installments of the series.

      The difference between the DS and the console versions is that on the DS, there are less disciplines (9 instead of
      18). The DS version doesn't feature an online mode or a complex career mode like in the other versions of the game
      (where all disciplines can be played in a championship), but features a fast mode where players can go through the
      single disciplines and train their skills, as well as a campaign mode where players compete against the computer
      in different disciplines. The game is controlled with the stylus and the touchscreen of the DS.</story>

    <story>The World Ends With You is an action-RPG that puts players in the role of Neku Sakuraba, a sullen, loner of a
      teenager who wakes up to find himself in modern day Shibuya, Japan, with no memory of how he got there and a
      ticking clock in his hand that tells him to complete the mission... or face erasure.

      Neku and his partner Shiki Misaki find themselves as "Players" in a game that lasts seven days. Each day, players
      are given various missions to perform by the "Reapers" within a certain time limit, or be erased from existence.

      Players use collectible pins to amplify their combat powers against "The Noise", animal-like creatures which can
      corrupt the people and environment around them. Each pin is activated in a different manner, from tapping the
      touchscreen, making sweeping motions with the stylus, or even blowing into the DS microphone. Neku fights on the
      lower screen of the DS, while his partner fights on the upper screen. Their combat styles are different, but can
      be combined to form more powerful attacks.

      Players can purchase clothing to increase the effectiveness of their attacks, and gain PP points to enhance their
      pin abilities. PP is usally gained through combat, but can also be gained by coming into wi-fi contact with
      another person's DS.

      There is also a wi-fi mini-game called "Ten Pin Slammer", where players can use one pin at a time to knock the
      other players' pins off the gameboard.</story>

    <story>Yoshi Touch &amp; Go is based on a tech demo that Nintendo showed at trade shows to demonstrate the technical
      abilities of the DS. Like in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Yoshi is carrying Baby Mario on his back and is
      walking through the countryside. There are enemies, pits in the ground, and other obstacles you must
      circumnavigate. You do not control Yoshi; you must use the stylus to draw alternate paths (made of small clouds),
      kill enemies, and throw eggs for him. There is only one level, but it can be played as a Marathon game, Time
      Attack, Score Attack, and a couple other modes. You can also play against a friend in Versus mode.</story>

    <story>After failing to kidnap the Mario Bros. in the original Yoshi's Island, Kamek the Magikoopa has decided to
      set his sights higher. Instead of just kidnapping the famous brothers, he's sent an army of his toadies out to
      kidnap children across the world! Luckily, Mario avoids escape, and again lands in the hands of the Yoshis. It's
      up to the Yoshis to carry Mario across Yoshi's Island and rescue Luigi and the other babies.

      Yoshi's Island DS is a sequel to the SNES game, Yoshi's Island. In it, players control Yoshi as he travels to
      Kamek's castle to rescue Luigi. Yoshi can carry Baby Mario, Peach, DK, Wario or Bowser on his back - depending on
      the baby carried, Yoshi will gain a special ability; for example, Mario lets Yoshi dash, Peach allows Yoshi to
      float for a longer period of time, and Wario whips out a gigantic magnet to attract coins and other metallic
      objects. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy, a counter appears, and begins to slowly count down to zero. If it reaches
      zero, the baby is kidnapped, and Yoshi loses a life. Yoshi can increase his counter by collecting stars that are
      rewards for some puzzles and defeating certain enemies.

      Another feature of Yoshi's Island DS is the ability to hurl eggs to defeat foes. Yoshi can eat nearly every enemy
      - if you press down on the control pad when Yoshi is holding an enemy in his mouth, he will turn it into an egg.
      Yoshi can hurl his eggs at enemies and objects such as certain walls to destroy them. You can even pick up coins
      and other collectibles by throwing an egg at them. Finally, Yoshi can ricochet eggs off walls to hit things that
      he would otherwise be unable to reach.

      While the object of each level is to simply reach the end, avid gamers will aim to get 100% for each level. To do
      this, they must reach the end of each level with thirty stars, find the twenty red coins hidden amongst the
      regular ones, and collect the five flowers in each level. One special "Character Coin" is also hidden in each
      level - these have a picture of a particular baby on them, and can only be collected when Yoshi has that baby on
      his back.</story>

    <story>Zendoku takes the concept of the puzzle game Sudoku and adds role playing elements to it.

      The game replaces the numbers 1 to 9 with nine Martial Arts symbols like a panda or a dragon but the original
      rules remain in place. This means the player still needs to complete a column, row or 3x3 box were every symbol is
      only used once. The player can test his skills either in Classic Sudoku or in Zen-Mode where he needs to solve
      Sudoku puzzles under the pressure of time, but the core of the game is the Quest-Mode.

      At the beginning of the quest the player chooses from eight available characters. Four fight with weapons, four
      freehand but each one has a different quest, uses different fighting styles and has a different lucky symbol.
      Kingkage is for example a typical ninja. He uses the Ninjutsu-style, wants to be a legendary fighter and has the
      panda as his lucky symbol. Once a decision has been made. the player follows the story line of the chosen
      character on a 2D world map and when a fight occurs, the opponents play a round of Sudoku.

      Every time one of the fighters completes a column, row or 3x3 box an attack is launched and obstacles appear on
      the opponents board while an attack icon travels along a rail towards the attacked. If he now correctly places his
      lucky symbol on the board, the attack will be reversed back his opponent. Placing a symbol incorrectly will make
      the player lose health and causes several cells on the opponent's grid to automatically fill in.

      The game also features a multiplayer mode for two player in which they can either try to solve a puzzle together
      or play against each other in a battle.</story>
