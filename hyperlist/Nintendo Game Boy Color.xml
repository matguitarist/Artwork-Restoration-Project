    <story>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it's later
      counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode and level codes were
      added only for the GameBoy Color version.

      To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe.
      To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers,
      collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great
      Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered
      across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time
      limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted.

      There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in
      Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these
      stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In
      Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the
      Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired
      trophy!</story>

    <story>Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its
      namesake. Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then
      give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.

      You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation. Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and
      clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris. The game consists of five zones, each with a different
      background and some with special features. Each zone has 15 levels. In addition to the standard asteroids, there
      are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets;
      crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy
      asteroids that shoot back! And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super
      Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.

      There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are also three
      skill levels. If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship. All ships
      features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace. There are also
      limited power-ups you can pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.

      The game supports either one or two players. In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in
      a random zone and level. You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....

      Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of "Classic
      Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.</story>

      Different species have different abilities and need different approach. The battles system is a mixture of real
      time and turn based combat. Unlike most other console RPGs, there are no special battle screens.</story>

    <story>Babe the Pig, of the eponymous movies, was raised by sheepdogs and, hence, believes himself to be a
      "sheep-pig", who herds sheep as his foster parents do. In this game, you control the plucky little porker and
      direct his sheep management attempts, driving them forward toward the goal in exaggerated, frictionless Soko-Ban
      or Boulder Dash style with porcine barks until their movement is halted or altered should their course intercept
      an obstacle such as a fencepost, moveable haystack, pit or trampoline.

      Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by lovable characters from both of his feature films, and the 40
      levels borrow inspiration both from the calm pastoral setting of the first and the surreal urban folly of its
      sequel. While the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the material finds a
      surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, "that'll do, pig."</story>

    <story>Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to
      clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center
      of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must
      keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle
      of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy
      all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.

      Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games
      versus modes, one player's success results in additional balls on the other player's screen which they then must
      clear.</story>

    <story>Balloon Fight GB is a color remake of Balloon Kid.

      All features from Balloon Kid are still intact. The main new addition is that there is color. There is now also a
      world map, and the title screen and menu systems are slightly different. Through the world map, levels are given
      names, which were previously unknown since Balloon Kid did not give any names to areas or levels.

      Balloon Fight GB is notoriously rare, and it was distributed via the Nintendo Power Flash cartridge, which is no
      longer supported by Nintendo. As such, copies of this game downloaded onto one of these cartridges can get high
      prices and rarely is ever sold. Due to the nature of this cartridge, the game would have had to been downloaded
      onto the cartridge before the service was discontinued.

      This game is available today on the 3DS eShop as a Game Boy Color Virtual Console game. However, the game is only
      available through the Japan eShop, so 3DS owners in Europe and America cannot download the software.

      After the Nintendo Power cartridge writing service was shut down, it was possible to order prewritten Nintendo
      Power cartridges with Balloon Fight GB over the phone, and these versions came with a fold-out manual and a large
      button with the game's box art, among other things.</story>

    <story>Barbie Pet Rescue lets kids play with and care for a variety of domesticated animals. Visit Barbie and her
      kid sister Stacey at the Pet Rescue Center, where you'll wait for rescue missions, explore in the playrooms, or
      tend to pets in the Care Center.

      Rescue missions come in over the phone or via e-mail; after learning which pet is missing where, travel with
      Barbie on her scooter to one of three different environments in which to search for one of eight lost pets. In
      many missions, you'll have to figure out how to entice scared animals to come to you, or how to retrieve pets
      trapped in trees or other sticky situations. If you get stuck yourself, Barbie will give you hints. With each
      successful mission, you'll receive a printable Paw &amp; Purr Award that hangs on the Pet Rescue Center wall.

      Rescued pets come back to the Pet Rescue Center with you and Barbie to wait for their owners and receive a little
      TLC. Nurse them back to health in the Care Center, where you'll give recovered pets water, treats, vitamins and
      grooming. You may also need to bandage a hurt leg or pick burrs from ruffled fur. After creating a file for them
      in the computer and giving them a name you select from a list of suggestions, the animals go to one of two
      playrooms to wait for their owners.

      In the meantime, you can play with them, plus all the other pets already in the playroom--a kitten, bunny,
      hamster, puppy, and a turtle. Select which animal you'd like to pet, then use the cursor to stroke an animal's
      head or back or scratch it under the chin. The animals respond to your attention by licking, rolling over,
      purring, or barking.

      There is a related mini-game for each kind of animal--Kitten Keepaway, Puppy Treat Toss, Hamster Trail, etc.--and
      if you do well enough, you'll see the animal perform a special trick. A few of the games require the use of logic
      and spatial aptitude, but for the most part they challenge the players' mouse mastery and hand-eye coordination.

    <story>In 2000 Ubi Soft released two David O'Leary-licensed games. One, David O'Leary's Total Soccer 2000, based on
      the PC game with the same name. The other one was a manager game, O'Leary Manager 2000.

      The gameplay in O'Leary Manager 2000 is not only about the management aspects of football. It's a bit similar to
      Sensible World of Soccer, as you can play not only as the manager but also the player. This rendered using an
      top-down view similar to many Amiga games from the early nineties.

      In total there is 240 licensed teams from the top two divisions in six European countries. As the manager you get
      to lay up training schedules, buy and sell players, pick the right players for the right tactics, and a lot of
      statistics. The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or a text-based
      interface similar to Championship Manager, but with highlights shown in the top-down view. If you don't want to
      play through the whole season, you can play single matches against the AI or another player. The manager mode also
      supports multiple players.</story>

    <story>Beyblade Fighting Tournament was the second video game released. This game features some concepts and ideas
      that were later abandoned within the Beyblade franchise, though many ideas were continued on within the manga and
      anime.

      The standard game play involves visiting locations and the player fights their way through tornements to advance
      to the next stage of the game. As each tornement was won, more parts and bit-beasts are made able to be bought
      from the games shop.
      The player could only start with one of 4 arch-types, "Dragoon", "Draciel", "Dranzer" and "Driger". Intially by
      default the player could only choose Dragoons, although codes were released in magazines to acess the other
      arch-types.

      Within each match, however, aside from the launch the player had virtually no control on the beyblade once it was
      in the arena, resulting in many matchses being won more based on luck and the beyblades strength then player
      skill.</story>

      living in the common world of today, who has to live through different adventures.

      witches to go mad. Bibi Blocksberg now has find all the parts to put them together and to restore the witches'
      mental health.

      The game is an action-adventure. The seven levels, each corresponding to one witch and one part of the crystal
      ball, are full of monsters which hurt Bibi when she touches them. The health can be restored by finding sweets
      hidden in the level. Apart of monsters, there are persons which help her. In each level there is a magical item,
      often reachable only after getting through a little "game in game", that expands Bibi's magical powers, for
      example the broom that allows her to fly. The magic has to be used sparsely, because it costs magical energy,
      which can be recharged by finding little pulsating dots. This magical item is needed to get to the witch of the
      level, which Bibi has to fight. If she wins, the witch gets back to normal, gives her a part of the crystal ball
      and Bibi can go the the next level.

      There also is a password system that allows the player to jump to different situations in the game, so that one
      does not have to play it through in one session.</story>

      This version features a pseudo-3D environment, where the camera is positioned behind the boarder and the piste

      The two main game modes are 'Competition' and 'Challenge'.

      Competition features a 'race attack' mode (basically a speed race with another AI player), Trick Attack (trick
      points based over 5 courses, beating a course threshold to advance), Time Attack (best time), and Supreme Attack
      (race with tricks).

      Challenge modes is about beating any previous records set for a particular track and supported Time Attack (best
      time), Trick Attack (best trick points), Slalom Attack (time on a flag course), and Vs Race (which uses the Game
      Boy Universal Link Cable).

      There is also a practice mode and a 'ghost boarder' - basically a replay of the player's best race.

      Trick moves include Mute Grab, Nose Grab, Tweak, Stiffy, Indy Air, Tail Grab, Stalefish, Shifty Air, Meloncholy,
      Frontside Air, Backside Air, 180, 360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, Front Flip, Back Flip, Rodeo Flip, and McTwist; most

    <story>Bomberman returns to the Game Boy Color. The adventure is much the same as before, plant bombs to blow up
      blocks and enemies that get in your way of the exit.

      Much like Pokémon before it, Max: Blue is one part of the adventure (the other being Max: Red Challenger Edition).
      During both games, you can pick up "Charabombs", creatures that you can raise as your own, and fight against other
      players Charabombs. It's a simple bonus game of Rock/Paper/Scissors, but the only way to complete the entire
      adventure is by linking both games together via link cable and pass over levels from one cart to the other, as
      each game has unique levels, so as to collect all of the Charabombs.

      In Max: Blue you play as Bomberman himself, with all of the classic graphics and sounds that have been part of the
      series from the start.</story>

    <story>The second half of the Bomberman Max series, Red Challenger is much the same as Blue Champion in terms of the
      tasks at hand for the main character. However, instead of playing as Bomberman, you play as Max, who still is much
      the same as Bomberman except for looks. The graphics are also slightly different for each level compared to Blue.

      The task stays the same, plant bombs to destroy blocks and enemies in your way, as well as collecting Charabombs,
      creatures who act much the same as Pokémon where you raise the Charabombs and fight against other players. Certain
      Charabombs and levels are only available in Blue, so you must link with another Game Boy and the Blue Champion
      Edition to collect all of the Charabombs and complete the adventure.</story>

    <story>A Bug's Life is a platform game with different goals in each of 15 levels. Most of the goals deal with
      getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a
      level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie.
      If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50
      pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each
      enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player
      areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially
      buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve
      problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens
      scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some
      levels also included Flikâ€™s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect
      grain and kill off enemy bugs.</story>

      Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops

    <story>This version of Chicken Run is far different from its console counterparts and is loosely based on the movie
      itself. This version's gameplay is geared more towards Lemmings where the player takes control of the main
      protagonists, Rocky and Ginger, and leads their fellow chickens out of dangerous situations by collecting bags of
      feed scattered throughout the stage and use the corn to lay a path around obstacles and traps to the stage's exit.

      It features over 24 levels, ranging from the chicken coup to the dreaded pie machine and features obstacles such
      as cameras, dogs, spotlights and many more. Players can also use common household items scattered throughout the
      level to aid the player in deactivating various traps and help spring their fellow chickens from certain doom.

    <story>Columns was to the Game Gear what Tetris was to the Game Boy. Some years after the Game Gear had ceased
      production, it was ported to the 'Boy. To spice things up, the game has been given several game modes, and, most
      notably, a licence to several popular manga characters created by Osamu Tezuka. Play as famous characters such as
      Astro Boy, Kimba or Black Jack.

      Apart from the main Columns mode, this edition features a puzzle mode like that of the Nazo Puyo games, where you
      must remove a set of pre-installed pieces using a set of pre-defined dropping pieces. There is also a link-up mode
      for battling with friends.

      The Tezuka characters play no big role in the game, being displayed in a window to the right of the playfield,
      changing mimics according to how the game progresses. You have six characters to choose from, and three save slots
      to put them in. The save slots let you keep your score for upcoming sessions.</story>

    <story>As a furby you must dance! Woo-teh-loh-wah-boo! Shake it to the left, shake it to the right.

      A Furby is an owl-like monster with fluffy pink banana ears. They love to dance, sing, and slowly learn human
      speech. Specifically a Furby is an autonomous toy robot manufactured by Tiger Electronics, licensor of this game.
      These toys were among the first successful domestic robots. Here they will be dancing for you.

      Dancing Furby operates as a classic rhythm game, with a line of button prompts scrolling across the screen that
      you will have to press when they reach the current time mark, supposedly matched with the music. A Furby on screen
      will dance in accordance with your performance, commenting on your timing in Furbish, "noo-loo" being perfect,
      "e-day" being acceptable, and "boo" is shrilled for failure. At the end of each song you'll have you score
      calculated in "noo-loo"'s etc. and then be allowed to continue.

      Successfully clearing a stage will result in you being able to 'connect' the Game Boy's infrared port with the
      matching port on the forehead of a Furby toy. This will impart information about the song to your furby teaching
      it to warble Für Elise when you least expect it.

      You may also select a Furby to dance with in the game, be it spotted, striped, or lozenge-faced. Good performance
      will unlock more Furbies.

      Songs in the game include Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Für Elise, and a few 'popular' numbers.</story>

    <story>Acclaim's foray into trick-based BMX games spawned a unique version for the Game Boy Color.

      The basic design is the same as in the original console title and other post-Tony Hawk extreme sports games. In
      career mode, the player has to complete various goals in each level to advance and unlock further levels. These
      goals include reaching a certain score through tricks and combos, performing special tricks, or collecting items.
      The eight levels (shown in isometric perspective) are filled with half- and quarter pipes, ramps, rails and many
      obstacles to perform tricks on. Two dozen different tricks are available through various button combinations, some
      of which must be unlocked first by finding tokens in the levels.

      In training mode, unlocked levels can be practiced without the time limit present in career mode.

      The game also offers a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can take turns on a single GBC and the player
      with the highest score or the best trick combo wins.</story>

    <story>The popular pursuit of hunting comes to the portable screen in DEER HUNTER for the Game Boy Color. You play
      as a hunter looking to catch a nice trophy in one of four different areas using three different weapons. Hunt deer
      with a shotgun, a rifle, or a bow, using slightly different tactics with each. If you want to be successful,
      you'll have to use real-world hunting strategies. Search for droppings or other signs of movement to find the best
      area to wait in. Once there, use one of an assortment of tools to help you catch your prey: mask your odor with a
      cover scent, use a tree stand to camouflage yourself, or lure the deer with a powerful musk, a deer call, or an
      antler rattle. It's up to you to decide how to catch the deer; some methods are more efficient than others, so
      you'll have to find the one that works best for you. Detailed graphics and digitized sound round out the
      experience for would-be hunters.</story>

    <story>Based on the 1996 arcade game, Densha de Go! was one of the first commercial train-driving simulation games,
      and went on to spawn numerous successors.

      The player can choose from a variety of tracks and trains and will then have to drive the train to the designated
      stations while sticking to the tight schedule, stopping exactly at the marked positions, obeying all signs and
      signals, and ensuring passenger safety and comfort.

      Whenever the player makes a mistake, points are deducted from a counter which at the start of each round is
      initialized to a value depending on the selected difficulty. If it reaches zero, the game is over.

      The following lines are featured:

      1. Sagano Main Line (Sanin Line) from Kameoka to Kyoto
      2. Keihin-Tohoku Line from Shinagawa to Yokohama
      3. Tokaido Main Line (JR Kyoto Line) from Kyoto to Osaka
      4. Yamanote Line (Inner Circle) from Shibuya to Tokyo Station
      5. Tokaido Main Line EX from Takatsuki to Osaka, part of the rapid Tokaido Main Line from the original version,
      but this time with stops at every station (Windows only)
      6. Sagano Line EX from Kameoka to Kyoto, without the shortcut from Saga-Arashiyama to Tambaguchi from the original

      The gameplay is more arcade than simulation. The focus is on stopping at the stations at the perfect moment and
      position, keeping up with the schedule, obeying signals and speed limits, and ensuring the safety and comfort of
      the passengers. Mistakes result in points being deducted from a counter. If it reaches 0, the game is over.

    <story>King K. Rool has stolen Donkey Kong's banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In
      search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters
      (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are
      also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses,
      including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of
      villainy.

      Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is
      generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to
      throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do
      cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.

      The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas,
      where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a
      larger version of a minor enemy.</story>

    <story>One of the great traditions in mythology is the story of the lone adventurer conquering evil in teh face of
      seemingly insurmountable odds. The first installment in the Dragon Warrior series throws you into the fray with
      little more than a horned helmet, the clothes on your back and the generosity of Alefgard's citizens. As you move
      from town to town, fighting monsters and collecting gold, the details of your mission to defeat the Dragonlord
      will begin to unfold.

      Dragon Warrior II
      The second quest takes place many years after the defeat of the Dragonlord. An era of peace and tranquility has
      been broken by the monstrous armies of Hargon, who invade Moonbrook Castel to assassinate the King. As the Prince
      of Lorasia, you'll need to travel the countryside in search of like-minded adventurers then set off as a party to

    <story>In Driver, the driving (pun intended) force of the world is crime. The main character, an ex-race car driver,
      takes on the role of an undercover cop. It seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the
      test. He orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the inside. As a result, the
      game takes place from the perspective of a low-level gang member. The action speeds into a number of different
      cities, ranging from San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will take place.

      Basically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30 different challenges await the
      persistent gamer. The missions are divided between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will
      each require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy
      getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission.
      If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If
      the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought
      and intelligence.

      Driver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the player against a horde of maniacal
      police officers. The crazed cops will do anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the
      city with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway mode, the idea is to flee for
      safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only
      goal is to avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to impede your progress.

      Driver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind. It offers a password save system to keep your data under
      wraps.</story>

      Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original
      Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.

      The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number
      of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive
      Nemesite.

      Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must
      shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar
      to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a
      surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</story>

    <story>F-1 World Grand Prix is a Formula 1 racing game for the Game Boy Color, based on the Nintendo 64 title. The
      Game Boy Color iteration features an official license of the 1998 season and thus all 11 authentic teams, drivers
      and tracks from that year. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version the game is completely in 2D and is viewed from a 3rd
      person perspective.

      The game tries to deliver the most realistic racing experience on a handheld of its time. You can manually adjust
      many aspects of the car before each race, such as transmission, gear, and tyre types and the alignment of your
      spoilers.

      The game features five playing modes (Grand Prix, Exhibition, Challenge, Time Trial and Two Player), two
      difficulty settings and allows for three separate save games. You can turn damage and different weather types on
      and off.</story>

    <story>Supersonic jet dogfighting comes to the small screen in F-18 THUNDERSTRIKE for the Game Boy Color. In this
      one-player flight sim, you take the role of a daring pilot who's flying an elite fighter jet. Slide into an
      inside-the-cockpit view, battle against multiple enemies, and practice your aerial combat and evasion maneuvers to
      prove your air superiority. You can play in either Arcade or Simulation mode, each affording you a unique
      experience. Arcade mode offers looser controls that make things easier for rookie pilots, while experts will want
      to jump right into Simulation mode, which will challenge the ability of even the most experienced flyboy. Head
      into multiple missions of dogfighting action and perform aerial tricks that will break the sound barrier, but
      don't think that it's all fun and games. When the mission's complete, you'll have to carefully land your jet on an
      aircraft carrier.</story>

    <story>The Game Boy Color version of Stars 2001 is very loosely based on the PC/Playstation game with the same name.
      Much of what made the original special is gone. For example, the whole concept of Star Points, which was such an
      important part of the console game has been removed. Left is a football game with a quite ordinary style. Due to
      the Premier League license all twenty teams are real and have real world players (16 in each team). The gameplay
      resembles the style of many classic games in the genre and is viewed from an top down perspective. Play modes
      available are friendly match, full season or a custom league of the players' choice.</story>

      premise of the show is that Flipper the dolphin has taught Lopaka (a native Pacific islander boy) the secrets of
      the ocean, allowing him to survive underwater for long periods and communicate with sea life. Together the two
      must usually stop the evil plans of Dexter, a mean octopus.

      The game has you trade off between the two characters: Lopaka must find a magic crystal in his sprawling
      platforming levels, then Flipper must take the crystal and place it on an altar in his Ecco the Dolphin-style
      levels. Flipper also handles the boss fights, and the bonus levels that are accessed by collecting 100 pearls.

    <story>Hoshizorashi Dynamites Arawaru!! marks another platformer entry in the Ganbare Goemon series. Forgoing RPG
      touches, the game returns to the action / platformer roots of the 16-bit titles by casting you as Goemon and his
      pal Ebisumaru as they traverse several levels based on a bizarre version of feudal Japan in hopes of defeating the
      forces of an evil alien invader.

      The Game alternates between stages featuring either Goemon or Ebisumaru. Each character takes a different route
      towards the bad guy and as a result the stages scroll differently for each character. You can collect upgraded
      items and weapons but there's no character upgrading besides that. The game also features mid-level bonus rounds
      featuring the rest of Goemon's buddies in several arcade mini-games as traditional for the series.</story>

      to destroy both, so Godzilla now has to fight off the military to throw back the alien menace.

      There are seven levels in all. The player will travel through each level destroying the military to reach the end
      of the level and fight the boss monster. The only control the player has over Godzilla is his attacks as Godzilla
      will walk on his own from left to right on the screen in a linear path. There are four attacks to choose from:
      Stomp, Bite, Tail-Whip and the famous Radiation Breath.</story>

      bosses are present. Such encounters include fights with a cougar, Cortez himself, and also playing Indian

    <story>In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob.
      Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.

      The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City
      (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level,
      a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing
      cops all raise the score, but the
      big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from
      simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission
      will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will
      gain even more points.

      Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At
      the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the
      player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop
      and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But
      even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results
      in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.

      The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better
      overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over
      the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra
      lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain
      score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with
      unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.</story>

    <story>Hanasaka Tenshi Tentenkun no Beat Breaker is a hybrid of the game Simon and a match-3 puzzle game. Four
      buttons are required to play - left and right on the Control Pad, and the A and B buttons. The game screen is
      split in half. The top half contains eight columns, followed by a striped line, and then an empty white area. To
      the left of the game screen is the time bar. As you complete rounds, the bar increases. When the bar reaches the
      top of the clock, the level is complete. If your white area fills up beyond the striped lines, the game is over.

      Each round has eight notes played in a specific rhythm. After they are played, they play again, and this time,
      after each note is played, circles fall down the columns. Your goal is to press a button when the circles hit the
      striped line, which turns them into colored circles with either arrows, A or B on them. These then land in the
      bin. If you miss hitting a note, the circles turn into black angry face circles, which are more difficult to
      clear. Perform enough beats correctly and happy face circles will appear - these act as wildcards.

      When three or more colored circles line up horizontally, they clear from the screen and points are scored. While
      you could complete levels by simply pressing the same button in time over and over, the other buttons can be used
      to set up combos, allowing for bigger points. In addition, if you press a note incorrectly, sometimes a different
      button symbol will fall instead, which you must then strategically try to clear.</story>

      is to use his father's discovery to return to the past and destroy an earlier time machine, which upset the

      You play as Sebastian, the soldier sent back in time to rectify the present. Hands of Time features an overhead
      view and six levels, each of which is comprised of a small overworld with various objectives. Much of the game
      requires completing item-swapping sequences in order to progress, while avoiding enemy soldiers along the way. You

    <story>The second Harry Potter role-playing game follows directly on from the first, with mostly the same game
      mechanics, controls and even some of the graphics.

      To unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, young wizard Harry Potter must fight turn-based battles and
      solve quests. In this game, he is not alone, as a party system was added: his friends Ron and Hermione (and some
      other characters) will join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the previous game) can use card combinations
      of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have other means: Ron can
      unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences combat
      through "lecture attacks", using helpful hints like "Be Careful!" (which increases defense, for example).

      Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but aside from the party system, several other features were added:
      the Informous spell divulges information about strengths and weaknesses of enemies, which is stored and can be
      accessed later. To aid in finding one's way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added.

      Like the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game
      can be accessed from the main menu.</story>

    <story>In the first Harry Potter game for the Game Boy Color, the story of Harry's first year at Hogwarts School of
      Witchcraft and Wizardry is told in the form of a traditional role-playing game.

      Playing as Harry, one advances through the plot of the book and the movie by fulfilling quests, battling monsters
      and gaining experience and levels.

      Combat is turn-based, with Harry being able to use a variety of spells against various critters and other enemies.
      In addition, card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards Collector's Cards can be used to produce powerful
      magical effects. These cards can be found all over the freely explorable Hogwarts. Potions that refill stamina and
      magic points can be found, bought or mixed by Harry himself, but only with the right ingredients.

      As in other Potter games, Harry also competes for house points for Gryffindor, hoping to win the House Cup in the
      end.

      The game features several mini-games that, once found in the main game, can also be accessed from the main menu.

    <story>Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center is a hexagon; six more
      hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one
      system. Two-player link mode is also supported.

      Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon. The CPU
      or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played
      piece. Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in
      tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two
      sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces
      cannot be played. In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the
      shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)

      In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.</story>

    <story>This to-go version of Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 is a top-down racing game, featuring two game modes
      (championship and arcade), 6 bikers and a variety of tracks in different scenarios.

      Season mode features 3 championships, each with three stages composed of four races. The goal is to win all 9 gold
      medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and
      stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.
      The difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less
      time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a
      spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited
      space.

      While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups
      - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the
      player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock
      the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.</story>

      balance the scale are given to you by conveyor belt. One on the left and one on the right. But these objects
      differ in weight, so you must carefully choose the scales bucket you're going to put the objects in. To make
      things worse, all kinds of trouble appear on screen to make it just a little bit more challenging. Like crocodiles
      that eat object or jokers that throw around playing cards offsetting your carefully balance scale. The game stages

      aliens. Run through each side-scrolling level and use all the weapons available to you to take down the enemy.

      Konami Racing: Top down F-1 racing where the higher you finish in each race, the better the points at the end to

      On this occasion, the games are Parodius (an R-type style shooter with plenty of humor and crazy characters);

      (a collection of track and field events including the 100m sprint, hurdles, long jump, triple jump and more); and
      finally, Frogger, the classic top-down puzzle game where the aim is to move your little frog across the road and
      the pond, dodging cars and crocodiles along the way to the lilipad.

      Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. After finding out all carrots have been stolen from their garden, as Bugs or Lola Bunny
      the player will have to investigate. Bugs will have to explore the Warner Bros. studio to find out who stole the
      carrots.

      Like many platform games you walk from left to right through a level. There are five different worlds which
      represent the surroundings of characters Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd and the
      Tasmanian Devil. Each world is divided into several levels. The object of each level is to find all film
      clapboards present.

      Bugs and Lola can jump and hit things with a mallet (or rolling pin for Lola). They also both feature unique
      special abilities. Bugs Bunny can dig and move heavy chests and Lola can float down safely from large heights with
      her parasol. Players can switch between characters at any time.

      Power-ups in the game include carrots for energy required for special abilities, a super carrot that allows the
      player to fly like a helicopter (using his ears) and the habanero carrot, which makes the player invincible for a
      while.

      If you collect the letters EXTRA during the level you get to play a small minigame where you have to shoot
      firecrackers at moving targets.

      Each of the worlds ends with a showdown with the major character of that world. Usually this involves running from
      a vehicle that pursues the player, while avoiding obstacles.</story>

    <story>You play as Lucky Luke, lonesome cowboy, who draws his gun faster than his shadow. In a received telegram you
      read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good
      cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game.

      Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking. There are also objects to collect
      such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful
      items. You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull,
      feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions.
      Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun's barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should
      shoot at them for a certain number of times.

      Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in
      Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final
      level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again.

      Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo,
      or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra
      life.</story>

      the series on a handheld in three years. The versions on consoles and computers having migrated to 3D graphics,

      Game modes include Exhibition matches, Sudden Death games (first team to score wins), Full Seasons and Playoffs.
      Progress can be saved through use of passwords. Game features include many known from other iterations of the
      series, such as player injuries and substitutions, audibles, detailed statistics, control of weather and game
      time, and more. The playbook not only includes a wide number of standard plays, but also a variety of trick plays
      like fake field goals and reverse plays.

    <story>Mario Golf on Game Boy Color isn't a straight port of the N64 game - it's a totally different game in its own
      right. It is a combination of a golf game and an RPG. As in an RPG, you choose your character at the beginning,
      with various strengths and weaknesses, and throughout the course of the game, your character gains experience
      points through winning matches or playing mini-games. Experience points can be distributed to various skills, such
      as putting, which makes it easier for you to do well. There are quite a few skills, and no two characters you can
      create will play in exactly the same way.

      Although the story mode is the main part of the game, there's quite a few other modes to keep you busy, like
      Tournament, Match Game, Stroke, Training, and the two-player mode via link cable. It comes with a dictionary of
      all the golf terms you'll need, and an extensive range of statistics on your player.</story>

      The main mode, Mario Tour, has you starting off as a Rookie with low stats. By completing training programs and
      defeating other students, you're able to gain experience points, which allow you to boost your tennis stats. When
      you're not playing tennis, you can spend time wandering the Academy grounds: talking to other students, or just
      taking in the sights and sounds.

      In addition to the main game, there's also an exhibition mode (singles or doubles) for quick-play. And, if you get
      tired of playing the computer, the game supports the Game Link Cable for play against a friend.</story>

      is hidden. She can also pick Clue up and throw him. Clue can be thrown and he can swim. Other characters can stand
      on him to get a bit of a boost to their jumps as well. Mary-Kate serves as a trampoline of sorts. The other
      characters can bounce on her head for a big jump boost. She can also jump the highest of the three.

      In each level, you must use the special abilities of all characters to remove obstacles,open the cage that
      contains the puzzle piece and reach piece. There are five mysteries in all, each with eleven stages, for a total

      back, and others have completely disappeared. There are tons of mini-games to keep young gamers busy here,
      including a mini-golf outing, a cheerleading challenge, and many others. One of the game's best features is a
      creative music-making program that allows kids to punch in their own cool beats and tunes. You'll start out the
      game in the freshman class, but piecing together the map and completing a few of the side games will earn you a
      pass to the higher grades. Get good marks and chase after good-looking boys in this fabulous adventure.</story>

      such as collection.

      Controls can be done either Mary-Kate style, where you use left and right to turn the horse, or Ashley style,

    <story>Maya the Bee &amp; Her Friends is the first game based on Maya the Bee, a world famous German book, comic,
      and animated cartoon series. This licensed title is based on the animated cartoon series.

      In the game evil spiders have kidnapped insects and asking for honey as ransom. It is up to Maya and her friends
      to thwart their evil schemes.

      The game has the player control three insects one at a time, but together on the same screen, Maya the bee, Willy
      the bee and Flip the grasshopper. Each insect has its own abilities. Maya can pull levers and Flip allows the
      others to leap to higher places. In each of the 120 levels an insect has to be saved and the three have to combine
      their skills to puzzle their way through the spider's web, in a similar vein as The Lost Vikings.

      The game was released in Europe only and is identical to The New Adventures of Mary Kate and Ashley, but with a
      different license. The same engine was later also re-used in Mary-Kate and Ashley Get a Clue.</story>

    <story>Metal Gear Solid (original Japanese name: Metal Gear: Ghost Babel) for GameBoy Color is not the same game as
      the popular Playstation/PC installment of the series. It is not set within the storyline of Metal Gear series, but
      instead tells an unrelated episode featuring the same hero - special agent Solid Snake. A secret government
      project, codenamed "Babel", attempts to revive the Metal Gear project - development of a highly destructive mech
      weapon. But an organization known as Gindran Liberation Front hijacked the Metal Gear prototype, without which any
      further development would be useless. Solid Snake is sent to infiltrate Outer Heaven, a location not entirely
      unfamiliar to him, and to retrieve the prototype.

      The game is similar in style and gameplay to early Metal Gear games. It is viewed from top-down perspective, and
      its gameplay is mostly based on stealth. Snake has to sneak past the guards, using various tactics to distract
      them or to kill them silently. Weapons, gadgets, and moves are all similar to those used in the other Metal Gear
      Solid game. From time to time Snake will also encounter bosses whom he will have to defeat in order to proceed to
      the next area. Virtual Missions for Snake are also included in this release.</story>

    <story>Metal Walker is a mechanical take on Pokémon, where the story takes place in the future on an island where a
      mysterious element called core has been discovered. This "core" element was used to create a highly advanced race
      of robots called Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and protection for the people of the island. One day,
      however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent member of the island. The player
      then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt
      down the rebel robots and avenge his father's death.

      The gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for clues
      called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of
      capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them. Destroying these other Walkers results both in scrap
      metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or "evolve" Tetsuo's Walker into a more advanced form.
      Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be turned into capsules as
      well. Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles.

      The battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of
      the walls of arenas. Additionally, if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on
      the screen at one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple
      opponents.

      There are also three types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokémon, susceptible to the other
      (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks). Base
      camps can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players
      Walker.

      As the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, each with their
      own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the
      island. Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even exchange their base camps.

    <story>Everyone in Mickey's home town was getting prepared for a big carnival! Professor Ludwig Von Drake had just
      finished all the carnival floats and was showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all their friends. However, spying
      from his creepy mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, furious at the group enjoying themselves. Soon,
      he'd gathered his cronies and raced into town, swiping all the floats and decorations. All that was left was a
      letter challenging them to a race to get their things back.

      Mickey's Racing Adventure is an adventure game that centers around isometric racing challenges in various worlds.
      It's possible to play as Mickey and his friends, as they explore various parts of Mickey's town, earning money for
      car upgrades and finding train tokens to travel to different worlds and challenge Pete and his henchmen to various
      races. For a fee, Magica de Spell will also conjure up spells for you to use in races and get an edge on your
      opponents.

      The first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey Jr., you must play a special train mini-game. Pete
      has muddled the tracks leading to the worlds, and you must guide Casey Jr. by shifting the track tiles around so
      that he doesn't hit any dead-ends. There are also TNT detonators that you must set off by running into them before
      you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit.

      The game also allows you to play as Pluto - while he can't race himself, he can sniff around town and dig for
      secrets. He'll also find hidden tunnels which let you play a Digger-like mini-game where you must either collect
      all the bones underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area by dropping rocks on them. After completing the
      objective, Pluto must then head to the exit.

      Mickey's Racing Adventure also supports the Game Boy Color's Infra-Red feature by allowing you to send e-mail to
      your friends via the Infrared Communications port. Once you unlock the Print Shop, you can also use the Game Boy
      Printer to print out assorted Disney stickers.</story>

    <story>The Weasels have kidnapped Mickey Mouse's dog! All that was left was a ransom note with a picture of Pluto
      being hauled away in a van, and some scrawled writing taunting Mickey to try and catch them. Not knowing what else
      to do, Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete plans to race! You'll have to
      speed across the country to catch up with the weasels and rescue Pluto!

      Mickey's Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as Mickey's Racing Adventure. Players
      can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around
      various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San
      Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few.

      The Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style. You must complete four races in each world, and at the
      end of each race, you're given points based on your placing. The player with the most points at the end of the
      four races wins the trophy for that circuit. There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the
      Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint
      Splotcher (an oil slick).

      There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you've previously unlocked - while you can use
      it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough to beat the track's lap time and earn a gold star in every
      race. Another mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'. In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given
      to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving. The faster you perform these tasks, the better
      ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal). However, you will receive a time penalty
      if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.

      Mickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color's functions - you can play a two-player link cable race,
      transfer data from Mickey's Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64
      version of Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock many
      postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.</story>

      which costs time and puts you way behind. As an added bonus, there is a Two-Player mode that can be played on one

      haunted house. The boards also contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a different
      playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as its computer counterpart, but they do
      translate well to the small color screen. The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the
      game's arcade feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and how it has evolved
      over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the classic game with enough boards and extras to keep even

    <story>Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your
      kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your
      sibling.

      Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a
      punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These
      activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of
      these, although only by a small amount.

      In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your
      actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to
      imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to
      shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what
      he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and
      the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring
      involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount.
      Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop
      available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys
      you breed and with whom.

      During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things
      such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent.
      These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a
      clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.</story>

    <story>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who
      works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

      Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost
      Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from
      any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

      Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this
      time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of
      time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

      Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</story>

      sword to hack away at enemies that appear one at a time and even a first-person shooting stage that resembles
      Lethal Enforcers.

      There are three different characters to choose from, Rick O'Connel, Evelyn O'Connel and Ardeth Bay that they can
      choose at the beginning of each stage, each with their own strengths and weaknesses and depending on which
      character they pick will determine which stage layout will be present (ex. Rick &amp; Evelyn's water escape stage
      feature different traps and enemies they must avoid).

      There are eleven stages total and a password feature that allows players to pick up and play at their leisure.

    <story>NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC is a descendant of the original NBA Jam, and is created by some of the key team
      members. The game follows in the footsteps of NFL Blitz, featuring the option to save personal records and a cheat
      code system operated by pressing a sequence of buttons. It also features unlock-able characters, including NBA
      team mascots, and the "On-Fire" option that defines Midway's sports games. Players are able to perform special
      moves such as the alley-oop, the spin move, and the double dunk. The game also features a Create-a-Player mode
      that allows custom players to have tweaked abilities by winning matches.</story>

    <story>The first PC conversion of the arcade hit, NFL Blitz gives the National Football League the same over-the-top
      treatment that Midway had used so effectively with NBA Jam. Features include exaggerated muscle-bound player

      Player taunts ("This is MY HOUSE!"), unpenalized late hits, and amusing running commentary from the announcers

    <story>NFL BLITZ 2000 brings fast-paced, no-holds-barred football action to the field. Rather than offering a
      standard football game, NFL BLITZ 2000 changes the rules a little. The game is played seven-on-seven, and it takes
      30-yards to get a first down. But probably the most important rule change is that there are no penalties. When you
      start the game, you have the choice of playing in the Arcade or Season mode. Arcade has you pick a team and try to
      defeat all of the other teams in the league, while in the Season mode, you take your team through the grueling NFL
      season in hopes of making the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl. No matter how you play the game, you will not
      miss a second of the action, thanks to three different camera angles. Try to keep your helmet on while playing NFL

    <story>Nicktoons Racing for the Game Boy Color is conceptually similar to its console counterpart. It's a kart
      racing game but on the handheld it is viewed from a top down perspective. Some of the most famous Nickelodeon
      characters are competing on the race track and the player can choose to play as any of them.

      Two game modes exist: quick race and championship. In the quick race mode players can choose to play any track of
      the four available program environments. In the championship the player has to complete each track in a specific
      order.

      The game allows the player to race as the following seven Nickelodeon characters:

      1. Tommy
      2. Eliza
      3. CatDog
      4. Arnold
      5. SpongeBob SquarePants
      6. Dagget
      7. Norbert

      Tracks are divided into four different program environments: Angry Beavers, The Wild Thornberrys, SpongeBob
      SquarePants and Rugrats. There's numerous power ups that the player can pick up. For example: Checkered Flag will
      increase the car's top speed, wrapped package gives the player a free lap, stop sign will stop the opponents for a
      short time and the milk bottle causes the opponents to lose traction.</story>

    <story>In 2000 Ubi Soft released two David O'Leary-licensed games. One, David O'Leary's Total Soccer 2000, based on
      the PC game with the same name. The other one was a manager game, O'Leary Manager 2000.

      The gameplay in O'Leary Manager 2000 is not only about the management aspects of football. It's a bit similar to
      Sensible World of Soccer, as you can play not only as the manager but also the player. This rendered using an
      top-down view similar to many Amiga games from the early nineties.

      In total there is 240 licensed teams from the top two divisions in six European countries. As the manager you get
      to lay up training schedules, buy and sell players, pick the right players for the right tactics, and a lot of
      statistics. The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or a text-based
      interface similar to Championship Manager, but with highlights shown in the top-down view. If you don't want to
      play through the whole season, you can play single matches against the AI or another player. The manager mode also
      supports multiple players.</story>

      works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

      Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost
      Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from
      any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

      Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this
      time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of
      time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

      Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</story>

      infiltrate a hidden cyborg manufacturing facility. Along the way, she will have her first encounter with the
      nefarious dataDyne corporation.

      Perfect Dark is a prequel to the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. Players assume the role of Joanna Dark, just
      before her induction into the Carrington Institute. The game plays from a top-down perspective, and you battle
      enemies with a variety of high-tech weaponry, from handguns to rocket launchers. A weapon can be assigned to the A
      Button and the B Button, which represent your left hand and your right hand. It's also possible to search dead
      enemies for items and ammo by pressing Select near their corpse.

      Perfect Dark also includes a variety of mini-games which you encounter as you progress through the story. There
      are target ranges to practice in, vehicles to drive, sniper rifle sections, which are viewed through the sniper
      scope, and more. There are also boss battles against enemy cyborgs, helicopters, and other deadly enemies.</story>

      the graphics are among the best ever created for the Game Boy Color. Modes of play include: Normal, in which
      Ulysses walks from location to location; Athletic, in which the hero runs and jumps through each level of the
      story; and Stealth, which requires Ulysses to crawl and slink into hidden areas not accessible in other modes.

    <story>Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by a monster
      that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power
      Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to
      defeat such monsters.

      This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within.
      To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is
      within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing
      a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.

      Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the
      blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or
      quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast
      radius, etc.</story>

    <story>Puyo Puyo Sun is the third entry in the main Puyo Puyo series of real-time puzzle games, its title being a
      pun involving the Japanese word for "three". The evil Dark Prince has caused the sun to augment its size and power
      to dangerous levels, and thus the Puyo Puyo world is on the verge of being scorched unless you prevent it.

      The game features three distinct story campaigns, each pitting you against a different set of enemies which you
      must battle in classic Puyo Puyo fashion: In each stage you face off against an opponent in two different play
      areas, one for you and one for your opponent. As the blob-like "puyos" start falling in your play area, you must
      align them and create groups of the same color in order to clear the screen before you get flooded with puyos.
      Chaining puyos of different colors allows you to send several "garbage" puyos to the opposing player's play area
      in hopes of either flooding it, or slowing his advance, and whoever defeats the opposing player moves on to the
      next challenger.

      New for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can be added to combos for extra damage. Also includes 2P vs
      gameplay, challenge modes and galleries and other bonus features.</story>

    <story>Pokémon Card GB2: Great Rocket-Dan Sanjo!, released March 28, 2001, is the Japanese-exclusive sequel to the
      original Pokémon Trading Card Game, also for the Game Boy Color. Like its predecessor, the game was developed by
      Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo, and was first announced in January 2001 by Japanese website WatchImpress.
      It includes new enhancements, such as the ability to choose the gender of the player character, a training mode to
      help new players, a Deck Diagnosis to rate the effectiveness of a player's deck, and a new group of antagonists
      known as Team Great Rocket. The game features all cards from the original game, along with new cards from the
      fourth set, Team Rocket, as well as cards originally exclusive to Japanese vending machines and the Pokémon
      Trading Card Game Instructional Video Intro Pack, bringing the total number of cards to 445.

      Like the previous title, players must travel across the game world challenging non-player characters to simulated
      battles using rules adopted from the original tabletop version. All locations from the original are present, along

    <story>A mix between classic "Walls" and "Bubbles" puzzles games
      12 characters to challenge
      12 gems to win
      Intense competitions
      4 amazing game modes

      The general objective of Puchi Carat is to destroy gem-like blocks using a ball and paddle. Gems "fall in" from
      the top of the play area one line at a time and are connected to each other either horizontally or vertically.
      Hitting a gem with the ball will destroy it, and if the destroyed gem causes other gems to no longer be connected
      to the top of the play area, they fall off, scoring bonus points. Destroying a special flashing gem also destroys
      all regular gems of the same color in the playfield. There are also metallic blocks that take more than one hit to
      destroy.

      The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the playfield, which can move left and right to bounce the ball back
      upward. Unlike in most other Breakout-style games, missing the ball does not cost a life or end the game, but
      rather adds more lines of gems to the top of the playfield. Gem lines will advance on their own after a certain
      amount of time, as well as when the playfield is cleared entirely or drops below a certain number of gems. If the
      gems advance across the line at the bottom of the playfield where the paddle resides, the player loses and the
      game is over.

      The arcade version of Puchi Carat features three main gameplay modes: A single-player mode where the goal is to
      clear a certain number of gem lines, a story mode in which the player challenges each character in a head-to-head
      battle (where dropped gems are added to the opponent's playfield from the bottom), and a two-player versus mode
      following the same rules as the story mode. Each of the single-player modes offers three levels of difficulty.
      Various ports of the game offer additional gameplay modes (such as time-attack mode), more difficulty levels, and
      expanded storylines for each character.</story>

      has some tasks which range from watering a flowerpot to triggering a drawbridge that will eliminate several rows
      which need to be completed.</story>

    <story>The arcade hit Q*BERT comes to the Game Boy Color. The player takes control of an orange creature that hops
      around a course built of blocks. The goal is to change all of the blocks to the appropriate color by hopping on
      them. As the game progresses, blocks will require multiple jumps. Complicating the process, a snake that wants to
      destroy you hops around the course, and there are two balls that go down parts of the course undoing all of your
      work. There are more than 40 levels to complete with several that are larger than one screen. Since all of the
      action in the game moves in diagonals, there are two different control schemes to maximize your fun. If you
      remember playing Q*BERT at the arcade, you will enjoy being able to play it in the palm of your hand.</story>

    <story>Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage. Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs
      International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic
      waste. George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic
      wolf. The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing
      the entire globe.

      The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking
      planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks. The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by
      traveling to the cities where they are located. Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that
      must be destroyed along the way. Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and
      optionally another player that can play simultaneously.

      The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful "cartoon" flavor. Gameplay includes players climb
      buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them. Once all the buildings for a
      particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage. Players can get
      many different kinds of power-ups that make them more powerful or restore health.</story>

      dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in
      a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in
      both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

      By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike.
      Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable
      time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get
      busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

      Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle
      simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</story>

    <story>OCP Technologies has developed an organic and mechanical hybrid supercomputer which they've named "The Mind".
      Unknown to the scientists however, The Mind has secretly been infiltrating computer networks around the world.
      When the project is finally deemed complete, OCP puts The Mind in control of the security systems of Delta City.
      At the same time, a gang war erupts in the city and several laboratories are broken into and looted. The police
      recieve a lead on a gang leader named "Nexx" who may be involved and assign RoboCop, a cyborg law enforcement
      officer, to bring him in.

      RoboCop is primarily a top-down action game. Robocop can move up, down, left and right across the map. Enemy units
      should be shot at to engage, while civilian units need to be protected. RoboCop's objective varies by level but
      typically involves destroying a particular enemy or finding "evidence" items scattered throughout the level. Each
      level is made up of several maps screens. Between missions RoboCop returns to the police station where he can
      consult with his ex-partner Lewis, review the station's news or talk to Dr. Lazerus, the scientist in charge of
      cybernetics.</story>

    <story>Robot Wars: Metal Mayhem is the first video game based on the British game show Robot Wars. It was released
      exclusively for Game Boy Color on 7 December 2000.[1] It was the first of four games based on the show, with the
      first three selling over 250,000 copies.[2] The game was based on the third series of the show, and competitors
      such as its champion Chaos 2 feature in the game.

      In the game, a competitor robot from the series, or a robot created by the player, is entered into combat against
      a robot controlled by the game. A bout finishes when one robot's health bar is fully depleted. In the Tournament
      Mode, the first robot to win two bouts advances. The game features the arena obstacles and House Robots of the
      series, and in other modes, a selection of mini-games based on the show's side events.</story>

      simulation of tennis than other versions, the handheld edition features cartoony 2D graphics and outrageous court
      locations.

      All-in-all, the game includes eight different players and twelve different tournaments. Only five players and four
      tournaments can be selected from the start, the others are unlocked by winning events. The starting tournaments
      are realistic grand slam events: the Roland Garros French Open (the only one with a license), the English Open
      (i.e. Wimbledon), the US Championship and the Australian Cup, on clay, grass or turf. Winning them unlocks the
      more unusual locations: from street and beach tournaments to far-out events in the Antarctic or on the moon.

      All events are single elimination, starting at the quarter finals. Matches follow original rules, and are seen
      from a standard perspective behind the controlled player. All characters (players, officials and fans) are drawn
      in a cartoony style with oversized heads. The controls allow for a variety of moves including backhand and
      forehand shots, volleys and lobs.</story>

      Mini-games include target shooting, fishing, shooting hoop, tossing frogs and hammer shot. The events are

      The platform levels have various themes such as clouds, rocket ship, a gooey world, a haunted mine, a volcano, a

    <story>What do you say? It's Scrabble, right? True, but not as we know it. Ubi Soft has finally reproduced one of
      the world's most popular board games for the handheld gaming community. Yes, this is Scrabble for Game Boy Color.

      Visually, there's really not much to say about this Game Boy Color version. The game consists of a series of white
      tiles each with their own letter and value. Is that enough for you? Oh yes. You know Scrabble. Seven random
      letters, make a word out of 'em, score points. Fall out with opponent optional.

      Seven lettered tiles it is then, with which you must formulate the highest scoring word possible. Clearly, letters
      such as Q, X and Z have a greater value, but the number of legitimate words that use these letters is limited.
      Once you've chosen your word, you must place it on a board in a horizontal or vertical fashion. Certain spaces on
      the board contain score boosters that will increase the value of your chosen word. Triple Word Score is
      particularly useful. Your letter supply will then be replenished and you must repeat the process once your
      opponent has placed his word on the board. At the end of the game, when the supply of tiles is exhausted, the
      highest scoring player wins.</story>

      modes to choose from:

      1. Normal, which is a best two-out-of-three game set.
      2. Power, where the player plays a game of tennis with the ability to use power-ups during the match.
      3. Points Win, which the player with the most points within a two minutes wins the match.
      4. Sudden Win, which has no service breaks and the first player with two victories wins the game.
      5. Squash, which is still a normal game of tennis, but adds walls to both sides of the court.

      There is also the Championship mode where the player takes on several different characters on different courts in

      (easy, medium and hard). There is also a two-player mode using a Game Link and supports three languages to choose

    <story>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank." The Tank was based on
      alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been
      created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because the Invaders are
      back!

      Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this
      time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game stays close to its roots while adding many
      power-ups and enemies.

      You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and
      columns, at one of three skill levels. You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars,
      then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less
      common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in
      the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you
      can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several waves on each
      planet, you'll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the
      original coin-op.</story>

      jet pack, and get ready to become the ultimate Burai Fighter.

      Space Marauder is an scrolling shooter game with two modes of play. Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling
      with pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout.
      Either way, the player is armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the
      powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything on screen.

      Space Marauder is the Game Boy Color version of Burai Fighter. Game play is exactly the same. Like Burai Fighter
      it offers the same three difficulties (Eagle, Albatross and Ace), but the game features different level layouts.
      It doesn't include the Vs. mode.</story>

    <story>Space Station Silicon Valley is a based on the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. It keeps story, gameplay
      mechanics and even the basic level design while translating everything into a platforming perspective shown from
      the side.

      The story is about a space station which is populated by independent robot animals. A while ago the station
      vanished but now it is back on full collision course towards Earth. Of course humanity sends squads out there to
      end the threat, but everyone but the robot Evo gets lost. The player takes the role of Evo who has to solve 35
      levels in order to save Earth.

      The unique characteristic of the game is that Evo has the ability to take control over any robot animal he meets.
      In fact, he is required to do so because his life energy rapidly decreases when outside of a host. All those
      animals have different abilities which are used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the levels. There are
      varying goals to complete in each level which range from destroying a machine to guiding sheep to their pens.

    <story>Based on the popular Todd McFarlane comic book, Spawn sends the titular hero through four stages of combat.
      He must navigate various environmental obstacle while defeating enemies with his fists and guns.

      Spawn is a platformer with some shooter elements. It contains both horizontal and vertical sections. You must make
      your way through these and defeat the various thugs and occasional bosses. Mostly, you'll be punching and kicking,
      but there are some guns with rather limited ammunition to find along the way. There is also one stage where Spawn
      rids a motorcycle, somewhat along the lines of the surfing and skating levels in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

      There are three difficulty modes. In each mode, enemies can take more damage. One punch will knock out any minor
      enemy in easy and you can start at any stage. It takes two in normal and you must play through from stage one. On
      hard, it takes several, so the fighting becomes much more strategic. You must beat the game on hard mode to get

      Curt Conners' lab will lead him into a plot planned by a mysterious villain, involving the alien symbiote and
      several of Spidey's arch enemies.

      The game is a platformer, divided into several large levels. Progression is not strictly linear: some of the
      levels can be freely explored in any order before continuing with the story. Locations include the city, subway
      and sewers, the docks and a warehouse. The levels are usually crawling with enemies that Spider-Man can beat up
      with kicks and punches. Defeating them will eventually result in him gaining levels, becoming stronger and
      learning some new fighting moves.

      Spidey's special abilities come into play when he swings freely over the rooftops, clings to walls or throws web
      balls at enemies to immobilize them. His spider-sense will usually alert him when important locations or special
      obstacles are near.

      The game includes various boss fights with the likes of Venom, the Lizard and the Hobgoblin.</story>

      crew-mates and decides to send S.O.S. to their friends on Earth. While the help is coming, the first events begin.

      First of all, you should assign 3 crew-mates to the team in order to explore the planet. After you move out to the
      ground you may switch between team members, walk around the planet, go inside locations, interact with items, talk
      with friendly persons, and begin battle with hostile creatures. Each member has a certain number of skills, which
      may be used and developed in RPG style, and some unique abilities. The monsters are seen by your team and battles
      may be avoided.

      The battle flows in side-scrolling real-time mode, when you control main selected character in the team, while
      others act based on their own AI.

    <story>This little mouse has one big journey ahead of him, and you're just the one to help him out. Unfortunately,
      the Little family didn't foresee the possible conflict of interest in keeping a cat and mouse on the same
      household when they adopted Stuart, and that's proving to be a bit of a problem. Between newfound enemies and
      domestic obstacles, the tiny mouse is having one heck of a time! There are eight gigantic levels to conquer in The
      Journey Home, and each one is based on a scene from the box office smash STUART LITTLE movies (which are, of
      course, based on the book by E.B. White). You'll end up tackling a mini-golf course, Central Park, a model boat
      race, a bunch of toy cowboys, and more in this epic quest for peace. In addition, here are plenty of platforms and
      hazards to run, jump, and flip through, and three difficulty settings ensure that younger gamers and experienced
      veterans alike will find the game appealing.

      In Stuart Little: The Journey Home, kids play as Stuart Little, the clever, ever-cheerful mouse from the popular
      Stuart Little movie and classic children's book of the same name. In the game, Stuart's just joined the Little
      family, and there's plenty of action to master, such as sliding down the laundry chute as a shortcut or using the
      flip-top bin to get more altitude. The Littles also join you in your play, as does Snowbell, the family cat who
      just can't warm up to even the most lovable of mice.

      This side-scrolling game abounds with action that uses many of the movie's favorite locations. The Journey Home's
      eight levels of gameplay take Stuart through the thrilling model boat race, a topsy-turvy miniature golf course, a
      toy cowboy town, and New York's Central Park.

      Every level is filled with power-ups and items that let you boost your energy and gain points. Three play settings
      make this a game that kids with varying skill levels can enjoy.</story>

    <story>When on a pleasure cruise for his tenth birthday, a young boy is swept castaway to a remote island by a
      fierce storm that destroys the entire ship. With no family or friends, he must fend for himself on this strange,
      seemingly uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home.

      Survival Kids is presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to Link's Awakening. Players must try to
      survive through each day by getting enough rest, eating food and drinking water regularly. This can be risky, as
      certain foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while other foods can go
      rotten and make you sick if you eat it.

      The game also features a unique "merge" system, which allows you to create a number of different items by
      combining two other items. For example, combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a
      bent stick could create a bow. There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to the essentials,
      so it's up to the player to think as to what could be helpful in their quest to survive.</story>

    <story>The object of the game is to score points by dropping balls onto sets of see-saws, in rows of three or more
      of the same colour. The twist, however, is that each ball has a different weight, determined by the number written
      on the front of it. The higher the number, the heavier the ball. This means that if a ball is placed onto one side
      of the see-saw which is heavier than the total value of the balls on the other side, the balance would be upset,
      sending the top ball flying across the playing field to land on another column. Cascade 'throws' can be achieved,
      and the game is over if a column reaches too tall. A variety of bonus balls, all with special uses, also feature.

      Teiruzu Obu Fantajia Narikiri Danjon?) is a role-playing video game for the Game Boy Color released by Namco on
      November 10, 2000, selling 136,000 copies. Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon's characteristic genre name is
      Dungeon RPG (ãƒ€ãƒ³ã‚¸ãƒ§ãƒ³RPG Danjon RPG?). It is the first sequel in the Tales series, which normally does not
      have connected storylines. The story begins 205 years after the beginning of Tales of Phantasia.

      Due to the limits of the Game Boy, the game uses a battle system called Petit LMBS, a turn-based variation on the
      Linear Motion Battle System used by the rest of the series. As in normal LMBS, the player controls only one
      character and does so via button combinations instead of a dialogue choice, while party members are
      computer-controlled. A remake of the game was later released on PlayStation Portable called Tales of Phantasia:
      Narikiri Dungeon X.</story>

      scrolling platform levels, in order to free his friends Babs, Pluck and Hampton from the clutches of Montana Max.

      Each level is populated by several enemies out of a total of 23 different enemy types. They can be defeated with
      different types of balls that Buster has at his disposal (football, soccer and baseball), that vary in their
      behaviour. The Baseball travels at slow speeds horizontally and explodes if it hits walls. It stuns all enemies
      close to the explosion. The Soccer Balls bounces of the floor and is bound by gravity, meaning that it will drop
      of edges etc. The Football travels very quickly and diagonally bounces of everything for a set amount of time.
      Soccerball and Football 'kill' with direct hits.

    <story>The Game Boy Color version of the original Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six game scales back the 3D visuals of the
      original game in favor of an almost top-down view, but builds on the same premise of the player controlling a
      member of the Rainbow counterterrorism unit, responsible for resolving hostage situations and neutralizing
      threats, in sixteen missions.

      The limitations of the platform are not traded in for an arcade-like approach. Just like the major computer
      version it stresses careful planning and tactics. After a briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the
      player assumes the role of the commander and assembles a squad of eight operatives, each with different statistics
      and abilities, based on character traits such as aggression and self-control, physical elements such as stamina,
      and specific skills including stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of weapons. They
      can be divided into up to four independent teams. Next, the operatives are outfitted with a selection of six
      different rifles, six different handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including heartbeat
      sensors and door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away, but that is not sufficient for later
      missions. In the planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out
      waypoints on the map and determine the course of action.

      The actual missions are shown in 2D where the different characters can sneak around, blow up doors, rescue
      hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a tactical approach. The general plot points and mission objectives
      are true to the computer version.</story>

    <story>Another round of Top Gear rally action on the GBC. On this occasion, depending on where you finish each race,
      you are awarded points. These points then go towards improving the stats of the rally car you are using (speed,
      braking, acceleration and top speed).

      Championships are split into seasons, each harder then the last. You can opt to change the weather conditions
      (day, night, sunny, rain, snow) or practise on the track to get used to the corners and timing.

      You can also play against a friend in two player mode.</story>

    <story>Top Gun: Firestorm takes the player to the skies again in twelve missions where numerous aerial and ground
      based enemies need to be fought to arhieve victory.

      The story is very loosely based on the movie of the same name. The player guides the well known pilot Maverick
      through a series of realistic training missions to receive graduation from the Top Gun school. The story is
      advanced in several stills throughout the game.

      The player will fly a F-14 Tomcat on an isometric map. He has to complete several objectives in each mission. To
      achieve those he has four different weapons at his disposal (machine gun, bombs, rockets and missiles). The
      gameplay is somewhat similar to the Strike series.</story>

    <story>On their way to help in the battle against Sargon, a crew of adventurers each skilled in their own way
      encounter a storm that rips a hole in their ship. Safely reaching Lamini, or Land of Towers, the friendly people
      of the land help repair the damaged ship. As the crew members are looking for a job, they meet the Mayor of the
      town who is in need of messengers. He tells the adventurers that Lord Baniff has not been heard from in weeks, and
      that he needs them to seek him out in his Tower and bring word of his condition. Entering the doorway into the
      Tower, the entrance collapses behind them and they must find their way out.

      The gameplay is similar to other first-person realtime D&amp;D games like the Eye of the Beholder series, though
      not as complex. There are four characters in the game and you choose one to control. Spell incantations are
      learned from scrolls and are cast by combining the correct syllables. There are 15 levels to explore and tons of
      monsters and items to find. You can play the game in cooperative mode with another player using a link cable.

      In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it's up to you to gain as many
      points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here's how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving
      gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the
      bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level.
      There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last.
      You'll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100

      If you enjoyed the multiplayer modes in Turok 2, then this is for you.

      Instead of the usual Turok single player missions, you must control your character and complete certain missions
      (from getting the most frags in a time limit, finding an item, or lasting the distance). Before a match you also
      get to choose which weapons to use, and you can unlock heaps of more weapons and character skins as you complete
      the objectives.

      Multiplayer is the main aim of this game, and there are plenty of 4 player game modes to choose from (frag and
      tag, capture the flag, Bloodlust, etc.) as well as a 2 player co-op Trial mode (much like the single player
      missions) time trials and frag fests.</story>

    <story>During a joyride in his biplane, the engine blows and Wario crashes into the woods. It's here where he finds
      a hidden cave with a magic Music box. Before he can say "I hate Mario", the box pulls him inside and into a room
      with a dark figure, who strikes a deal with him. Find all of the missing Music boxes and he can leave. And any
      treasure he finds he can keep.

      Much like Wario Land 2, Wario can't die from any attacks by the enemy. However he can change form after certain
      attacks, which can both help and halt his progress in each level. New forms of Wario include Invisible Wario and
      Ball of Yarn Wario (an un-controllable ball of yarn, with Wario inside).

      Also, basic attacks such as swimming and the butt stomp don't become available to Wario until after completing a
      certain amount of levels, meaning you have to go back to completed levels to access other areas full of loot.

    <story>Seeking revenge on Wario after he stole their treasure in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, special agents from
      the Black Sugar Gang of Kitchen Island sneak into Wario's newly built castle, steal back the treasure, and leave
      the castle and the surrounding area a mess. As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call
      your own.

      In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by
      an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other
      Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of
      the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and
      Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can

      Warlocked brings real-time strategy gaming to the Boy Color set in a fantasy warfare scenario. The key to victory
      is a balanced mix of resource gathering, building, exploration and combat. Adding a magical twist to the

      Using a Game Link Cable, you can test your war skills against another player. Two-player battle maps are earned by
      progressing through the single-player game. Warlocked also enables you to build your own personal armies with
      resources that you have saved in your campaigns in single player mode, and then trade them with a friend using the

    <story>"Wendy: Der Traum von Arizona" is an action adventure for children of any age.

      You play the party of Wendy, a German children's cartoon star. She and her friend Bianca are dreaming of going on
      a riding holiday in Arizona. To get the money required for it, they have to win horse tournaments.

      There are seven levels. They are divided into two types: There are action-adventure levels where you have to
      accomplish different tasks -- like helping your parents or shoeing your horse. To do this, you have to speak to
      different people, find and use items at the right location and succeed in some mini-games, all the while keeping a
      safe distance from evil animals (like sheep...) which hurt you when touched.

      Between these action-adventure levels, there are the tournament levels in which you perform in several different
      riding disciplines, often with some qualification stage before.

      At the end of the game, there is another arcade sequence in which you have to drive the taxi to the airport. If
      you have done this, you can enjoy the ending.

      After finishing the game, you can switch to a "tournament mode" where you can replay each tournament to get as
      much points as you can.</story>

    <story>While exploring her house's attic, the little witch Wendy discovers a treasure chest. Upon opening it,
      magical stones are released from their prison, and head to a castle which is suspended in the sky. The power of
      the stones upsets gravity, and the castle comes crashing to the ground, right on top of Wendy's house! It's up to
      Wendy to set things right again!

      Wendy: Every Witch Way is a combination of a side-scrolling platformer and a puzzle game. As Wendy, players
      explore the castle in search of the troublesome stones that have upset gravity. Wendy has the ability to control
      gravity herself – by pressing up or down on the control pad while jumping, Wendy will cause gravity to reverse in
      that direction. Most enemies and obstacles in the game world are also affected by the gravity switching – you'll
      need to manipulate gravity frequently to progress through the game's different puzzles.

      Stars can be used to power up Wendy's magic. For every star that she collects (to a maximum of five), her magic
      will increase. Beginning with a small weak shot, you can power your magic up to a spread shot that fires in three
      directions. The stars also act as Wendy's health meter – if you get hit, you'll lose a star, as well as some
      magical power. Get hit when you have no stars left, and you'll lose a life.

      At the end of every world, there is a short bonus stage with Wendy riding on her broomstick. In these stages, you
      must attack enemies and collect stars as Wendy automatically flies to the next world.</story>

    <story>Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American
      F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II.

      It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of
      islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to use rockets to take out
      the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine
      guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.


      You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from assaults by
      Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those
      by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.

      The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese
      soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps &amp; trucks. Also missing in this version are the
      Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a
      barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you
      bonus points.</story>

      Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17's
      WORMNET.

      For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an
      artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind
      effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move
      around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns
      to exploding sheep.

      Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their
      cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.

      Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge

      player's character another shot at the title if they rescue Stephanie.

      There are six levels to choose from as the player will transverse these stages and fight off referees, street
      punks security guards and even other WWF superstars with a punch, kick, a dropkick or through various weapons
      scattered throughout the stage such as steel pipes, nightsticks, 2x4's along with many more objects. Not only does
      the player have to defeat enemies they also have to avoid various traps and pitfalls such as patches of fire,
      floor traps and laser cannons to name a few.

      There are also power-ups that are located in various places throughout the game which can replenish the player's
      health and power bar among many others. Additionally, when the player fills up their power bar they can unleash
      their character's unique finishing move such as the Stone Cold Stunner or the Pedigree on a selected enemy. There

    <story>WWF Wrestlemania 2000 is THQ's first WWF licenced game after making two previous WCW titles. Wrestlemania 2K
      picks up where WCW/NWO Revenge left off. The graphics are by far superior as well is the animation. Wrestlemania
      2K adds three highly sort after features: Cage match, custom entrances and Create A Wrestler feature.

      Wrestlemania 2K features more than 50 real WWF stars as well as the option for 16 custom wrestlers. All the
      wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide shows) and entrance
      performances. A great improvement over the previous game is the "road to Wrestlemania" mode, an enhanced
      tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be challenged by other wrestlers in a 12 month
      journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.</story>

    <story>Like it's bigger brother on the PlayStation, X-Men: Mutant Academy on the Game Boy Color is a fighting game
      starring Marvel's famous mutants.

      The character roster includes four X-Men (Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm and Gambit) and five evil Mutants (Magneto,
      Toad, Mystique, Sabretooth and Pyro). There are also two additional secret characters, whose unlocking codes are
      revealed upon beating the game's story mode.

      In addition to the story mode, in which one character takes on all the others in consecutive fights, there is a
      training mode, battle mode (featuring teams of three characters each), survival mode (one character taking on all
      others with only a single bar of health) and a versus mode utilizing the Game Link cable.

      The Game Boy's two buttons are used for kicks and punches (or basic mutant abilities like Cyclops' eye beam).
      During a fight, a rage bar will slowly fill, which allows using powerful special attacks activated through button
      combos.</story>

      You can change the character at any time during the game, which is important as your characters power level
      decreases as you go. When you change a character, the character you take out rests, and the power level increases.
      Also, some areas can only be completed by using the certain powers of each character.

      Apart from the normal mode of play, you can also play a second version, where you must fight all of the Boss

      1) Hack and slash with his claws (the main attack)

      2) Jump (very important to get through levels)

      3) Heal (stay still, and he will heal a little at a time. Just be careful, each level has a limited amount of time
      to complete, so don't stand around too much)

      and 4) If you press the attack button (see (1)) several times in a row, Wolvie will go off in a rage. Although
      hard to control in this state, his attack range improves. He also loses a little health every time)</story>

      that will increase the player's abilities depending on the next event the player enters. Players may be able to

      Ranger Smith.

      Boo Boo: "But, Yogi, the Ranger isn't going to like this."
      Yogi: "Not to worry, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!"

      This is a puzzle game requiring strategy. A cloud above will hold several colored balloons while moving left or
      right. When it reaches the screen edge, it drops down a bit. You have a picnic basket with two balloons attached.
      By pressing the B button, you can rotate the balloons 90º and swap the colors. By pressing the A button, you
      release the balloons. The object is to get three balloons of the same color to touch. They will then pop and will
      be gone. Remember, the cloud is moving so time your release so the balloons go where you want. You are trying to
      clear all the balloons to move on.

      Every fourth level is a boss level where you have Ranger Smith on top of the cloud. He stomps the cloud to lower
      it and drops a stone. If the stone hits your basket, you will release your balloons, whether you want to or not,
      and will not be able to move for a couple seconds. Once you clear all these balloons, you will have defeated
      Ranger Smith and will move on to the next area. If you match a balloon with an arrow in it, the cloud will move up
      a little. If the balloons reach the bottom, you lose. You can then choose to restart the level you were on or end

    <story>Zebco Fishing! is an officially licensed fishing game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 different lures
      and 2 lakes to fish on. The player can participate in a tournament and Blackjack Bass. The tournament mode gives
      you a limited time to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you have to catch 21 pounds worth of fish, similar
      to the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, you get its weight and can decide to "hit" or "hold". If you
      exceed the 21 pounds you lose.

      The player can row his boat around the lake until he has found a suitable fishing location, where he can cast his
      line and wait for the fish to bite. Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it
      in. When you do so you must make sure your line doesn't break by keeping an eye on the tension.

      Weather conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each type of lure
      also improves the odds in specific types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells the
      legendary Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.</story>
