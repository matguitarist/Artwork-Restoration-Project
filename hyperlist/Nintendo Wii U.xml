        <story>Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel to Batman: Arkham Asylum and is set about one year after Bruce Wayne
            became Batman. The main villain is the drug lord Black Mask who assigns eight powerful villains - e.g. Bane
            or Firefly - to assassinate Batman once and for all. During the course of the story, Batman also has to deal
            with Joker for the first time. It is also long before Arkham City was established and therefore Batman can
            explore the whole city; the new city part has about the same size as the known area. However, the different
            setting does not make a whole lot of difference - because of a curfew there are no civilians to be found.
            Batman can use the Batwing for fast traveling (there is no active flying involved) and visit his Batcave.

            also a difficulty level with a different type of effort required and they are marked either for a younger or

            island for over 1000 years. Sonic accidentally unleashes a powerful villain named Lyric, a member of a
            robot-snake race called the Ancestors, who wants to get enough power to feed his war robot army with the
            Chaos Crystals to destroy all that is organic and create a world of twisted metal and robots. To stop
            Lyric's evil plan, the group must set aside their differences and find the Chaos Crystals before Lyric. The
            stakes have never been higher, and the only chance to beat Lyric is to come together and work as a team.
