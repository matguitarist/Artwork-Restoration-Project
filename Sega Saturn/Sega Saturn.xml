    <story>The story of Advanced V.G. follows a similar template as those of the previous Variable Geo games: the
      strongest young women in the country hold a tournament, which is sponsored by various restaurant chains, which in
      turn ask the competing girls to pose as waitresses working in said restaurants, for promotional purposes. The
      girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young
      martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition.

      Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic "kick" and "punch" moves, while the
      various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game,
      "Normal", "Vs.", and "Story". The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an
      AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo "computer vs. computer" gameplay, with the
      possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the eight heroines is available as a playable character in these
      modes. The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only, and follow her story.

    <story>Airs Adventure takes place in an environment reminiscent of 17th century Europe. The game follows the story
      of an aspiring knight (default name Henry), who is framed for a crime and is about to be executed. However, the
      beautiful princess of the country feels mercy and stops the execution at the last moment. As the hero tries to
      uncover the truth about his conviction, fate brings the two together, and they begin a journey to discover distant
      lands in search for adventure, and perhaps even develop feelings for each other...

      The game's combat is a rather simple version of the traditional Japanese-style RPG system. The player controls a
      party that contains only Henry and the princess. Whenever enemies are encountered, a separate battle screen
      appears. Commands are executed via a standard menu, allowing physical attacks, defense, as well as offensive and
      supporting magic spells. Graphically, Airs Adventure combines pre-rendered character sprites with partially
      polygonal backgrounds, with an over-the-shoulder view.</story>

    <story>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in
      three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³)
      and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain
      goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or
      activating switches.

      Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens
      (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the
      Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are
      beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.

      Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades
      and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like
      grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps
      (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are -
      but only if they are moving.</story>

    <story>Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name.
      There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an
      all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including
      operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace
      accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like "a blanket
      covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people." The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an
      influential mercenary company, known only as "the Bureau," has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot
      named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative
      contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.

      Naturally "the Bureau" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed,
      Gert Staun's battle walker, called the "Slambird" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the
      Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move,
      fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and
      not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between
      an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player has no power to control
      this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will
      automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.

      The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side
      will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing
      difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators,
      land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly
      armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get
      enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of
      unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety
      of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic
      trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These
      cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can
      be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are
      automatically used instead of missiles.</story>

    <story>The basic lore of the series is built around a Queen who fairly and wisely rules a Cosmos. By balancing
      elemental forces with the help of nine Guardians, she keeps the various planets in her domain stable and her
      people content. However, the powers of the Queen and the Guardians fade over time, and successors must be
      appointed. In the first game and its various remakes, the protagonist is a 17-year-old girl named Angelique
      Limoges who has been chosen by the current Queen and her aide Dia as one of two candidates from the Royal Smallney
      Girls' Academy to become the next Queen. She is transported to the Flying City to begin her final examination.

    <story>Pu-Li-Ru-La is a psychedelic side-scrolling arcade beat 'em up set in the magical land of Radishland. As the
      story goes, some evil magical entity has stolen the keys of time for the towns in Radishland, freezing time and
      turning every animal and creature into evil magical contraptions. Only Zac and Mel, empowered with their "invented
      magic sticks" are able to escape the curse and must thread through Radishland turning all the monsters back into
      their original form and recovering the keys of time.

      Gameplay-wise the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up in which you control your character in a 2.5D isometric
      plane as he clears each stage by beating the many wacky enemies with his stick and a few magic spells that are
      randomly selected whenever you start the game. At the end of each stage there is a harder "boss" creature you must
      defeat and upon doing so you proceed to the next stage.

      The game is notable for its surreal graphic design, featuring digitized graphics merged with hand-drawn sprites
      and featuring mostly colorful nonsensical graphics. Features single player or co-op two-player gameplay modes.

    <story>In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest, where a lot of gambling and
      corporate cash is involved.

      Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a virtual tank of massive
      firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up
      power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.

      Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a "wire framed" virtual
      environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose
      the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking
      missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or
      shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control
      it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.

      Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash.
      The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features.</story>

      The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it
      fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas.
      There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the
      playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the
      task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.

    <story>Long time ago, at the dawn of Japanese legendary history, the godly princess Kushinada defeated the Aragami,
      monsters who drew their power from an energy source called the Blue Seed. But in every epoch, the Aragami return
      to bring death and destruction to Japan.

      Enter Momiji Fujimiya, a regular Japanese teenage girl... until she discovers that she carries the power of the
      princess Kushinada within her. She joins a secret government organization that specializes in fighting Aragami,
      receiving missions from her boss, Daitetsu Kunikida.

      The structure of the game is mission-based: upon receiving a mission, Momiji and the other agents (mostly young
      women) explore various locations in Japan, talking to people and locating the supernatural source of danger.

      The game has dungeon navigation, turn-based combat, and party management, but in other aspects it differs from
      typical Japanese RPGs. There are no random enemies, and generally not many battles. There are also no levels or
      experience points of any kinds. The battles utilize a card system. Depending on the character's agility (which can
      be increased with items), she/he can execute a number of offensive, supporting, or defensive moves by choosing a
      card from the available deck. Battles are won by planning and learning the enemy's strategy rather than by
      leveling up.

      Each character also has special abilities that must be used to solve puzzles. For example, one of the characters
      can use dynamite to blow up walls and discover hidden passages.</story>

    <story>Bomberman Wars is a video game in the Bomberman series released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation on April
      16, 1998. The main character is King Bomber who rules over his kingdom. The object of the game is to conquer all
      the pieces of the Bomber country. Eventually you fight the main villain, Bagular, and his four henchmen.

      This is one of the earliest games in the Bomberman series to stray away from its party game roots and focus more
      on the single player component (though it did have a VS mode). It is the third Bomberman game for the Saturn, and
      the second for the PlayStation.</story>

      This game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of

      connected to any bubbles it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the level is complete. One
      result of this change that may appear strange to players of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top

    <story>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams is a one level themed "demo" of NiGHTS into Dreams. It was originally released
      in November 1996 for the Sega Saturn.
      Due to its freebie nature, Christmas NiGHTS is a much smaller game than NiGHTS into Dreams - there is only one
      level (Spring Valley - almost identical to the level seen in regular NiGHTS) however unlike the original it is
      playable as Elliot as well as Claris. When playing as Elliot the stage is mirrored.
      Christmas NiGHTS is Christmas-themed, and so its graphics and music have been replaced with winter-esque versions
      of the original stage (but only in winter). For example, Ideya Captures are now giant floating Christmas trees,
      and NiGHTS wears red attire rather than purple. Gameplay is largely identical to the original game, including the
      A-Life system altered by defeating enemies.</story>

    <story>Clockwork Knight is a game that depicts the sometimes friendly, sometimes combative, secret lives of toys.
      Betsy has a huge number of toys that come to life in the absence of humans and normally play nicely with each
      other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with some other
      knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time until a rogue toy
      shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other toys against Pepperouchau.

      The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages constructed of elaborate series of toys,
      traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks,
      sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with
      a key sword that has offensive use as well as the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas.
      The second stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an
      impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch
      out for the jet transformer boss at the end of the room.

      Other stages include missions through other areas of the house including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the
      game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other
      friendly toys between levels who give you the opportunity to gamble with your earned coins.</story>

      such as driving on grass or hitting the rails without losing speed) and in one of three lengths: Normal (identical
      to the arcade original), Grand Prix (2.5 times longer) and Endurance (10 times longer).

      On the downside, detail and frame rate suffered a drop to fit the game into the limited hardware of the Saturn and
      Personal Computers, and lacking any kind of multiplayer, comparing to the two to eight player rumbles of the
      arcade version.</story>

      The game doesn't mess too much with a background story- it's a 3D one on one fighter that takes place within an
      arena of limited space. Each character has their own unique way of fighting, their own abilities, and even their
      own hobbies and likes. (For example, Ryu Hayabusa- yes, he of Ninja Gaiden fame- likes sushi, mountain climbing,

      can play through all 10 events in standard order.

      Points are awarded for your performance in each event and, when completed, you will be rewarded with your final
      decathlon score. There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game.
      In this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that
      event in order to progress. Once you've qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.

    <story>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced
      with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating
      code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and
      the defence software to fend them off.

      The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a
      handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and
      scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.

      A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major base functions. You use this
      interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you
      find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets
      remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success.

      As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your
      ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.

      gameplay to its predecessor, as well as to the main Shin Megami Tensei series. Set in a futuristic cyberpunk
      environment, the game contains many characteristic elements such as two weapon types (swords and guns) for the
      main hero, a female companion who can learn and cast magic spells, and a party of six active combatants, of which
      four are demons. Like in many other Megami Tensei games, the player can communicate with randomly encountered
      demons and recruit them into the party by selecting appropriate dialogue choices. These demons can also be fused
      with each other to create more powerful ones.</story>

    <story>A conversion of Sega AM1's arcade 3D scrolling fighting game based on the first Die Hard movie. One or two
      players work their way up and down a skyscraper in attempting to rescue the President's kidnapped daughter.
      A large number of fighting moves are available through the simple controls of punch, kick and jump, plus movement.
      Many weapons are available from knives and broken bottles to machine guns and rocket launchers. Other objects can
      be picked up and used as weapons such as chairs, an aerosol and lighter combo and even a grandfather clock!
      Between several of the stages are reaction tests that require a button to be pressed quickly, usually punch, kick
      or jump. Failure means an extra fight has to be won often with little or no reward in terms of items.
      The climax sees the heroes fighting the mastermind (who has many swords on his person) on the roof of the
      skyscraper.
      Also included is an old Sega arcade game, Deep Scan, used to gain extra credits for the main game.</story>

    <story>Die Hard Trilogy is split into three games, each game representing one of the movies, obviously.

      Die Hard 1 is a third person shooter in a style similar to Tomb Raider. You are John McClane and must fight
      through twenty floors of terrorists in the Nakatomi Plaza. The game has an invisible wall effect which allows you
      to see John even in small hallways.

      Die Hard 2 is a first person rail shooter in the vein of Virtua Cop or Mad Dog McCree. Once again you take the
      role of John McClane firing upon terrorists who happen to be ransacking the Washington/Dulles Airport in search of
      a South American dictator and druglord.

      Die Hard 3 is a fast-paced taxi racer through the city. John must this time speed through New York City defusing
      bombs and ramming evildoers off the road behind the wheel of a cab.</story>

    <story>Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents)[1] is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter
      (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in the video
      game industry, for having ushered in the popularity of the first-person shooter genre. The original game was
      divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an
      updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.

      In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as "Doomguy", fighting his
      way through hordes of invading demons from Hell.[2] With one third of the game, nine levels, distributed as
      shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15â€“20 million people[3] within two years of its release, popularizing
      the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the FPS genre, it pioneered
      immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via
      packaged files in a data archive known as "WADs". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter
      games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as
      "Doom clones". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of controversy.

      The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion
      packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for PC DOS, the
      games have later been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it
      spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose
      mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have
      continued making WADs, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular
      attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using new technology, and an
      associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Doom 4 was announced as in production in 2008 and was later retitled simply
      as Doom</story>

    <story>Aliens have landed in futuristic Los Angeles and it's up to the Duke to bring the pain and show them the
      door. After the initial entries of side-scrolling platform games, Duke Nukem 3D introduced a first-person
      perspective to the series and turned the game in a full-fledged shooter with 2.5D graphics.

      Duke's arsenal includes pistols, pipe bombs, laser trip mines, Nordenfelt guns, a chain gun and various rocket
      launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects
      in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches
      and security cameras. As a mature game, the protagonist is also able to hand strippers a dollars to have them
      remove their top.

      The character, voiced by Jon St. John, also regularly delivers commentary on the events through one liners. There
      are 28 levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a
      Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and
      members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to
      medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, nightvision, protective boots, a hologram known as the holoduke, and a
      jet pack to reach higher areas. Most of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles
      needed to progress or access secret areas.

      The game includes network play through the IPX protocol, for deathmatch and cooperative games.</story>

    <story>Enemy Zero is one of the horror titles by Warp, closely connected to D (and its sequel D2 for Dreamcast). It
      also features the same heroine as in D series.

      The crew members of the spaceship Aki were in a state of suspended animation. All of a sudden, the ship emergency
      program woke them up. What has happened? Apparently, a hostile alien life form had penetrated the spaceship. Now
      Laura, the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her way through the maze-like
      corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more
      intimidating because they are totally invisible.

      The game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you enter a room, the enemies can't
      attack you, and you can explore it from 1st person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you
      wander through ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are invisible, you'll have
      to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means
      it is attacking from the side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the distance
      between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.</story>

      private investigator Kojiroh, and the special agent Marina. The original version was a full-fledged hentai game
      with explicit sex scenes. Subsequent releases removed those, but still contained a lot of sexual innuendo in the
      dialogues and images of half-naked girls.</story>

    <story>"Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96
      was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and
      opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

      There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the
      game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the
      incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than
      the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.

      The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for
      better-than-minimum system

      FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league
      to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's
      possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play
      domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of
      the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</story>

      PlayStation, SNES, Mega Drive and Sega Saturn followed.

      FIFA 97 was the fourth game in the FIFA Series and the second to use the Virtual Stadium engine. Unlike the first
      game to use the engine, FIFA 97 features polygonal players as opposed to the 2D sprites used in FIFA Soccer '96.
      The engine however received complaints for being sluggish in the PC and PlayStation versions.

      David Ginola (then a Newcastle United player) graced the cover of the game in the European market. He also was
      used for motion capture for the polygonal models in the game. Bebeto (the Brazilian striker) was featured on the
      cover for the Americas and Asia-Pacific markets.</story>

    <story>Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into the realistic fighting engine
      of the first Virtua Fighter. The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most
      involving gameplay.

      In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers. Fighting Vipers has drastically
      different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2. Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is
      simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for "casual" gamers.

      Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult. But Fighters Megamix
      manages to do so by offering many options. The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters
      Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay. Other options
      are unlockable while playing the game.

      One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters. Not only
      are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden
      characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the arcade-only Sonic
      the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com
      version.

      This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the United States and was directed by Yu
      Suzuki.</story>

    <story>Armstone City, year unknown. The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament with the grand finale being held
      on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers, young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their own goal on
      mind. All eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with a burning desire to
      meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman,
      construction worker and former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky, plus
      Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.

      While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers included several changes, such
      as a wall surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can
      only be broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to opponent
      hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw.

      Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably faster, with combos done by fast
      button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional
      push on the d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a
      fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter,
      but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.

      Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game options allow the player to tweak the
      difficulty setting, number of rounds before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit,
      if the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes: Original (based on the arcade
      version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their
      armour, allowing to perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to change the
      disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.

      Another mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or fighting demos recorded by the AM#2
      staff, each with the ability to choose a camera. As usual with Sega's fighting ports, extensive bookkeeping is
      included, as well as a few hidden characters.</story>

      a racing game - it is a racing simulation, wherein the player makes choices regarding the construction (and

    <story>Galactic Attack is a coin-op conversion of the Japanese arcade game RayForce (GunLock for European arcades).
      A top-down shooter, there are seven levels to play, ranging from battles in the atmosphere of planets to battling
      over mountain ranges, each with their own standard huge bosses at the end of each of these levels. The player
      takes control of a starfighter called the RVA-818 X-LAY, out to destroy any opposing forces.

      The story has the future of Earth governments gathering together to construct a massive super computer called
      Con-Human to help with the planet's environment, providing nutrients to the earth and caring for the ecosystem.
      However, a cloned human is linked with the system and makes Con-Human a sentient being. The system eventually
      becomes insane and starts to create natural disasters, wiping all nearly all of mankind and destroying the
      ecosystem, driving the survivors into space to develop colonies on other planets. Con-Human then makes Earth into
      a giant fortress and is assembling a massive armada to destroy the remaining survivors, but before it can attack,
      the survivors amass a first strike in order to reclaim the Earth.

      The goal is to fly around in the level, using the primary laser weapon to destroy various enemies flying in and
      out of the screen. Players can upgrade this weapon by collecting "L" icons floating around when enough enemies are
      destroyed. There is also a secondary weapon, a lock-on missile launcher, that has the ability to fire upon eight
      different ground enemies at once.</story>

    <story>Fatal Fury 3 retains the format and controls of the previous game in the series, Fatal Fury Special. However,
      the two-plane battle stages have been revamped into a three plane format known as the Oversway System. The player
      fights primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or "oversway" into either of the sway lines
      at the background (LP+LK) or foreground (LK+HP). When the player performs an attack in a sway plane (or an
      Oversway Attack), their character will return to the main plane. Likewise, the player can attack an opponent who
      is in a Sway Plane with an Anti-Oversway Attack. The player can also do a "Quick Sway" to avoid an attack, leaving
      the opponent vulnerable to a regular attack.

      Other new techniques introduced in this installment includes controlling the height of the character's jump, block
      an opponent's attack at mid-air (Air Guard), and a new type of combo techniques known as Combination Arts,
      allowing the player to cancel a specific series (which varies between characters) of regular attacks from one to
      the other. In addition to the regular Special Moves, and the Super Special Moves which can only be performed when
      the life gauge is flashing red, each character also has a "Hidden Ability", which is a stronger version of a Super
      Special Move. A Hidden Ability occurs once in every 1024 chances whenever the player inputs the command for the
      character's Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability can also be used by activating "Super Mode" before a match using
      a secret code. The player then enters a specific command for the Hidden Ability when the life gauge is flashing
      red. Unlike Super Special Moves, a Hidden Ability can only be used once per round.

      Fatal Fury 3 also features a Fighting Level system when fighting against the computer. When the player completes a
      round, their performance is graded from D to SSS. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the Single
      Player Mode is determined then by the player's average.</story>

    <story>Loosely based on the classic medieval Chinese novel "Water Margins" (Shuihuzhuan) by Shi Nai'an. The game is
      a fantasy RPG set in an imaginary universe, its main theme being political struggle. The hero of the game is the
      young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire, presently controlling the land of Toran.
      Through a series of events the hero becomes involved in a rebellion against the Empire, led by an organization
      known as the Liberation Army. Will the hero find a new home there, will he be able to tear himself away from
      everything that has been sacred to him, including his own father?

      Suikoden is a console-style RPG with several unusual additions. There are three kinds of combat in the game, the
      most common one being the traditional turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active
      party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow limited usage of offensive and healing
      spells. There are also army battles, where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians,
      etc., and one-on-one fights.

      The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as their home base and fortress.108
      characters can be recruited in the game, a tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in "Water Margins". Many of those
      characters will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while others will act as strategy
      advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various ways.</story>

    <story>Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive
      Entertainment in 1997.

      Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second
      title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play
      Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel
      to the hockey game, also released in 1997.

      Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in
      software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.

      Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the
      genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity
      and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed
      and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach
      was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with
      a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.

      Other highlights amongst Grand Slam's feature set included:

      - A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a proposed trade was in its best
      interest.

      - Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each batter's strengths and weaknesses.

      - Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat,
      light- hearted commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an
      in-game JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.</story>

    <story>Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the
      Sega Saturn in 1997. It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact
      known as the 'Spirit Stone'. The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble
      knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and
      even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes
      use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.

      The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.
      Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles. Combat
      itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the
      right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.

      The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters.
      Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water,
      etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage. There are a large
      number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.</story>

      franchise. The player controls a futuristic tank, and there's hardly a human character to be seen. The enemies are

    <story>Treasure's unique scrolling beat-em-up/RPG hybrid, Guardian Heroes introduces the player to a motley crew of
      heroes (Consisting of a swordsman, a ninja, a cleric and a mage), formed to find a "legendary sword". The game
      begins with the heroes in a bar, having found this sword, as they decide what to do with it. Before they have a
      chance to come up with an idea however, they are interrupted as an Imperial General charges in and warns them they
      are in grave danger. Seconds later, Imperial troops swarm into the inn and the heroes are forced to take flight
      along with this general.

      The fighting mechanic is slightly deeper than the average scrolling beat-em-up, with light and heavy attacks,
      special moves (executed the same way you'd expect a normal beat-em-up to work), magical attacks and the ability to
      block. As you defeat enemies you gain experience points, with which you can upgrade your character between levels
      - sharing them between various factors such as strength, speed, constitution and magic resistance.

      Even more interesting however is the hugely branching storyline, which changes according to decisions you make (of
      which there are many) and which character you select to play with.

      Also of note is the fact that even in one-player mode there are always two of you on screen - you command the
      other character by changing his "mood" - aggressive, cowardly etc. - of which there are six. On top of this, it is
      possible to play the game as a more traditional beat-em-up with up to six players/bots, and in this mode you can
      play as any character that you have encountered during the main game mode.</story>

    <story>Gussun Oyoyo is a puzzle game developed by Irem for the Arcades in 1993. In the following three years, it saw
      several ports (and a sequel) for consoles. These ports were handled by different developers, and are subtly
      different interpretations of Irem's source. Irem themselves would eventually produce a PS1 sequel in 1996: Gussun
      Paradise, known in Europe as Yoyo's Puzzle Park.

      The core gameplay of the series is to help Gussun and his brother Oyoyo (Vic and Vinnie respectively in Risky
      Challenge) escape a flooding stage by building a stairway with Tetris blocks. The goal is to reach the ceiling
      before the water level drowns the pair. Gussun and Oyoyo move independently based on their AI, similar to the
      titular rodents of Lemmings, and the player needs to anticipate their AI pathing and their habit of occasionally
      freaking out whenever scary things happen.

      In addition, the player can often choose between Emily and George as their "cheerleader". Emily is a young woman
      who frequently changes costumes while George (originally Yousame) is a buff bodybuilder. Later ports removed
      George.</story>

      championship, a world league or a penalty shoot out session. Each team counts with an "Ace" player (you can guess
      who he is by seeing "Ace" above his head during a match), or in other words, the man with the best skills in the
      team. The game also counts with a system that lets you execute special actions during a match, but these have to
      be "exchanged" for something called units (you start every match with 20 of them), so for example, if you want to
      execute an Hyper Shoot (the most effective shoot in the game) you will have 6 units less. These actions must be
      executed by your "Ace", and he can be as far as the area as he wants, because in all cases the shoot will still be

    <story>A futuristic racing game with hover cars, in the same line as Wipeout, using a modified version of the Magic
      Carpet 2 engine.

      Gameplay takes a straightforward approach, with the directional keys controlling the steering and throttle, and
      three keys to fire the minigun, missiles or charge the booster. While the minigun has unlimited ammo, both fuel,
      armour and missiles must be replenished by passing through some marked areas or picking up powerups in the track
      or by left destroyed opponents. While the vehicles float on the track they are still influenced by the ground
      material: they slow down on dirt and even more on water. Each track has a number of shortcuts or alternate routes
      that offer powerups, and some tracks feature gates and ramps that open or close randomly.

      Includes 9 tracks and several game modes (for Saturn owners and PC players with the 1.2 patch installed) such as
      single race mode (with option to change the number of laps), a Championship mode, Split Screen, Clone Race
      (beating the ghost of the best race time), Death Match (Where instead of finishing first what matters is finish
      alive and with the most kills) and Hot Seat, where up to eight players can compete in the same race by taking
      turns, with the computer taking control of the players' vehicles waiting for their turn. There are six hover cars
      to choose from: the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder and Vampyr and the slow but armed to
      the teeth Berserker and Jugga. In addition to the natural capacity of each, their Minigun, Missle and Booster
      capacities can be upgraded by picking up powerups during the race. There are Eight teams to choose from, which
      change the colour of the vehicle: Mad Medicine (white), Bullfrog (aqua green), Storm Riders (purple), Fire Phreaks
      (orange), DethFest (blue), Foo Fighters (yellow), Gorehounds (red) and Assassins Anonymous (black).</story>

    <story>Three men and a cowboy plot to assassinate tyrannical criminals in the old days of Japan. They go around at
      night, kill people, and sometimes have to fight something really weird like a magic monster. There are hand drawn
      art pieces that accompany the story between levels, but for the most part, you can ignore them. Plot really
      isnâ€™t that important in a game like Hissatasu. Itâ€™s more about the action than anything.

      Hissatsuâ€™s sprites are all in live action, but itâ€™s background are all hand drawn sprites. The effect ends up
      being very surreal, like youâ€™ve got live action people walking around in a cartoon world. It doesnâ€™t help that
      all of the special effects use sprites, which only compounds the weirdness. The music is good, but very quiet. I
      guess it makes sense, as youâ€™re walking around at night and killing people, sometimes without them even knowing.
      Sometimes the tracks get intense, but itâ€™s usually because something really cool is about to happen, like a boss
      fight or some kind of supernatural enemy is appearing.</story>

    <story>With disregard for a background story, Funcom Dublin offers a Wipeout-esque mix of racing and driving at a
      very fast pace. Completing laps within the allotted time does not suffice, you also need to destroy a certain
      amount of vehicles. Contrary to the aforementioned title, you drive ordinary racing cars, if you count out the
      mounted weapons. These include mines, concussion missiles, smart bombs, heat-seeking missiles, lasers and
      firewalls. Some are provided by taking out enemies, but power-ups, time bonuses, energy, armor and a handicap that
      turns the screen upside-down, can also be collected.

      Five cars are available, with different statistics and built-in weapons. The initially weak weapon is soon
      replaced when you collect upgrade icons. To activate these, you have to complete a bonus stage after which you can
      also save your game. To add to the game's length, each of the twelve tracks, based on the settings "city",
      "mountain" or "space", has three variations: reverse, at night or the combination of the two. Other features
      include a small diagram showing approaching cars to time your mines, and pumping electronic tracks to match the
      game's pace.</story>

    <story>True to the comic books, the Hulk relies on no other weapons than his massive muscles to punch, kick and

      Spin or the Floor Hammer. Rare bonus items also allow the Hulk to summon one of the four Pantheon team members
      Atalanta, Ulysses, Ajax and Hector to assist in the thick of battle.

      Most levels include at least one arch-enemy, such as Piecemeal, Trauma &amp; Lazarus or the U-Foes. Luckily, the
      Hulkâ€™s regenerative powers allow him to regain health slowly. Little seems to be left of the Hulkâ€™s legendary
      leaping capacity, however, so the green meat ball is forced to hop from platform to platform every now and then.

    <story>This arcade game is based loosely on the 1996 blockbuster movie "Independence Day." Interspersed with
      cutscenes lifted from the film, the game consists of flying a jet through various missions in order to take down
      the gargantuan, city-destroying spaceships. This entails flying around the 3D level and taking out targets such
      as: communication uplinks, shield generators, the occasional alien fighter craft, and ultimately bringing down the
      major alien ship via a strike on its main cannon. Powerups are plentiful, such as medical packs that heal your
      jetcraft, bonus weapons, bonus planes, and an item that freezes enemy planes for a brief time.

      Mission settings include the Grand Canyon, Washington D.C., and New York City. There are other missions that are
      provided on a need-to-know basis (as stated in the manual). The game also features 2-player head-to-head action
      via a network or null modem link.</story>

      or Hard), and the Oracle provides clues to help along the way.

      The graphics for the puzzles are designed in an Egyptian or Mesopotamian style. Music plays in the background to
      provide atmosphere, but it can be turned off, if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an
      Oracle's well. There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where you begin the game.
      In each room is a puzzle you have to solve to get a jewel which must be taken back to the Oracle's well.

      The puzzles in this game can be compared to those found in The 7th Guest. The Chinese Checkers puzzle in Shivers
      rivals many of the ones contained in Jewels of the Oracle.</story>

    <story>The original guitar hero with the Elvis attitude and purple hair pompadour, Johnny Bazookatone, has been
      imprisoned in the year 2050 in Sin Sin Prison by El Diablo, the Lord of the Underworld, who is jealous of his
      talent and kidnaps other musical legends as well in this 3D side-scrolling platformer. Johnny's guitar Anita has
      been taken from him and he sets out to escape and vanquish foes on his way to be reunited with Anita.

      He can perform moves such as 360-degree spin jumps, and hover jumps among others, while using his bazooka guitar
      as a weapon. When powered up, it can emit a special sonic blast that fries anything within hearing range. As you
      make your way through the demonic levels such as Hotel Demonique, Hell's Kitchen, and Mr. Diablo's fiery
      Penthouse, you can acquire more weapons, power-ups and find secret passages that lead to bonus levels. The game's
      soundtrack includes the title track contributed by Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora and Tico Torres.</story>

    <story>Based on the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa and officially licenced by player of the tournament Jonah
      Lomu, this game plays as more of an arcade style of gameplay rather than a sports simulation. Players can compete
      in the full World Cup, a round-robin league, or a knock-out cup.

      The 32 included teams range from the All Blacks of New Zealand and Springboks of South Africa to minnows such as

    <story>Jung Rhythm is one of the few music-based games on the Saturn. Gameplay is similar to Space Channel 5, in
      that a music sequence is played and then the player is required to repeat that sequence. In Jung Rhythm, the
      required buttons scroll across the bottom of the screen while the music is playing. You merely press the displayed
      buttons at the correct time.

      The graphics are made up of 3D models for the characters, and have a unique cartoon-style. The graphics suit the
      style of game and are quite nice. The music has a very quirky Japanese pop-style. The songs are all quite catchy,
      and you will find yourself humming the tunes long after you have turned the game off. The lyrics are all Japanese
      (with a few exceptions), but this doesn't take away from the gameplay.

      There are some negatives to the game. Sometimes you will enter the button presses exactly, but still get booed.
      And conversley, you will sometimes make a mistake, but still get a wow. This doesn't happen enough to ruin the
      game, though.

      If you have a Saturn, and you want a solid music-based rhythm game, there are few choices. Luckily, Jung Rhythm
      fills the gap nicely.</story>

    <story>K1 Fighting Illusion Show is by far the best boxing game available for the Saturn. XING really did a good job
      in bringing this Asian sport featuring many types of arts to the Saturn. The Saturn port features all the best
      fighters of the time (1997) such as the now deceased Andy Hug, Ernest Hoost, Peter Aerts and Nobuaki Kakuta.

      The arenas are fully 3D with multiple camera angles to choose from and nice solid looking fighters which are also
      quite big for a full 3D game. Games like Sega's fighters as classed as fully 3D however I disagree since the
      backgrounds are 2D.

      Many modes of play are available to choose from starting with the standard 1 &amp; 2 Player Vs modes as well as
      Tournament and Team Battle modes. Plus there's even an AI setup mode.

      If you're looking for a different type of fighter other than the standard Sega fighters or Capcom / SNK 2D
      fighters then I recommend K1 Fighting Illusion Show.</story>

    <story>Keriotosse! is an action game for the Sega Saturn.

      What a nice surprise this one was, looking more like a late generation PlayStation game rather than a Saturn game,
      Keriotosse! is one of those everyman for him self type fighting games. Well, I say fighting games but it's more
      like do anything possible to survive the battle. You and 3 friends or 3 CPU controlled characters if you're doing
      a one player game, take to an area in an all out battle to survive. Use any means necessary to survive including
      using the level's obstacles, your own magic or just brute force. All characters are 3D polygons yet look very nice
      indeed. The areas you battle within are also 3D based yet don't look it thanks to the quality textures used. There
      are also quite a few nice transparency effects on some of the levels.

      Are you a big Poy Poy fan? Sad that such a game never came out on Saturn? Well, ease up, because Keriotosse! is
      here. In Keriotosse! 4 characters are dropped in 1-story arenas where the goal is to be the last person remaining.
      You eliminate your foes by kicking them out of the playing field, or you can use your designated special move to
      help knock them out</story>

      SNK's flagship series returns for another year. Many of the changes in this year's KOF release come in the form of
      improved graphics, sound effects, music and totally redone character sprites. The gameplay of the system has been
      altered with the addition of "Rush" multi-hit combos and new moves for practically every character. The storyline
      of the series receives heavy focus in this release with the Orochi Saga swinging into high-gear.

      The King of Fighters '96 has 27 regular characters plus 2 boss characters (who can be unlocked with the use of a
      code). Newcomers to the tournament include Mr. Big from the Art of Fighting series, the bosses from Fatal Fury
      (Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard), and completely original characters like Leona Heidern, Mature and Vice. Other
      features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default "Team Fighting"
      mode or the traditional "Single Fighter" style of gameplay, plus the "Versus" and "Survival" gameplay modes.

    <story>Another year, another KOF. Additions this year come in the form of slightly improved graphics and sounds, new
      moves and a new game mode. Gameplay is much more plot-driven, as you have middle-bosses that can change depending
      on what team you select. In addition, there are several special endings which are only shown when certain "Edit
      Team" combinations are selected.

      As of The King of Fighters '97, you can play in either the Extra or Advanced game modes. Extra Mode is the typical
      AOF/KOF scheme, in which your power gauge fills up as you defend yourself or charge yourself up. The new Advanced
      Mode, on the other hand, only allows you to charge your gauge as you perform special moves and attacks, similar to
      the Street Fighter series. Extra allows one to sidestep attacks while Advanced allows the character to roll past
      and dodge attacks; Advanced also allow a character to perform a potent "Super Desperation Move" (or SDM) at any
      time provided the character has at least two full bars of charged energy stored. In contrast, SDMs can only be
      performed in Extra when a character has less than a quarter of their health left.

      New characters include the New Face Team, the Fatal Fury Outlaw Team (featuring the KOF debut of "Blue" Mary Ryan
      and Ryuji Yamazaki, and the return of Billy Kane), and Kyo's pupil Shingo Yabuki. In total, The King of Fighters
      '97 sports 29 separate characters (without counting the six Orochi-related boss characters, which are all

    <story>Initial D: Koudou Saisoku Densetsu is a 1998 racing game for the Sega Saturn tying into the Initial D media
      franchise. It was the only game in the franchise released on a Sega system; Sega themselves would later license
      the franchise for an on-going series of arcade and console games.

      Initial D, a popular long running manga series, has spawned not only an equally popular anime series and a
      live-action movie adaptation, but several video games over the years. The series' first appearance on home
      consoles occurred in 1998, with the release of Initial D for PlayStation and Sega Saturn.

      The series follows Takumi, an indolent teenager who, after delivering tofu for his dad's business in the early
      hours of the morning, finds himself to be something of an expert in the art of drifting down mountain roads. This
      in turn leads to him and others racing each other on a variety of Japanese mountains â€“ perfect video game
      fodder.

      The main guts of the game is the Story Mode which sets up a series of races via some FMV clips and static CG
      images. There is no voice acting in either of these which is immediately jarring and something that instantly
      stands out when played today.

      The music deserves a mention also. Anyone who has even a basic knowledge of Initial D will know that it is defined
      by not only fast paced drift racing, but an equally high energy Eurobeat soundtrack. Inexplicably, this is missing
      entirely from the game. The music used sets the atmosphere well, but fans will notice the change and will lament
      what feels like a missed opportunity to add to the authenticity of the game.</story>

    <story>Steeldom or to give it it's original Japanese name of Koutetsu Reiiki is the follow up to Hyper Reverthion
      also available for the Saturn. The game features fantasy based robotic creatures which are piloted by different
      members. The game plays very much like it's original but now with more fluency and moves. It's still difficult to
      control though which makes playing it at first a pain. Once you've mastered the controls though you'll find
      yourself enjoying this nice little game. The graphics are much sharper than Hyper Reverthion and even feature some
      transparencies ! The music is quite similar to the original game which is no bad thing. The tunes range from
      average to really good, as you'd expect from Technosoft.

      If you're looking for something a little different then maybe this could be a nice pick up for you. A special
      mention must go to the fact that this game is one of the very few games that support the Saturn's link cable.

    <story>In the early 21st century, the Earth is under attack by aliens. In five areas of the planet, they have
      erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also
      taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed
      "Krazy Ivan". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's
      perfect for the job.

      The player controls Ivan's "Steel Cossack" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five
      areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground
      vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the
      Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.

      The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and
      other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which
      recharge shields or rearm weapons.

      After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.

      Between the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian
      accents) continue the story.</story>

      Takumi Corporation, a company made up of former Toaplan members which formed shortly before Toaplan's closure.

      Naxat Soft were responsible for bringing the game to the Saturn, adding Plus to the title as well as CGI

      new beings on the planet when one day it disappears.

      This is where the player takes control of a cat-girl character by the name of Kittchu, who is accompanied by a
      pink seed-pod that resembles a pig, traveling the planet from continent to continent in a tornado whirlwind,
      vanquishing enemies in an attempt to recover the "Mother Flower" and bring order back to the planet.

      The gameplay is reminiscent of the earlier Zelda games, where the player uses various weapons to hack and slash
      enemies, likewise the players seed companion will charge at enemies from distance. To obtain weapons, the player
      must search for weapons seeds and using water left behind vanquished enemies to grow them. There are six different
      color coded seeds to be found which are powered up through four different levels which gives over 120 different
      weapons to be used. Likewise, health recovery items are acquired in the same manner, by using water to grow

    <story>Magic Carpet is a first-person perspective game, in which you are a mage who flies on a, well, magic carpet

      equilibrium" within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level.

      To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it
      "yours". To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A
      balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level and collect "your"
      mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won't be able to hold much mana, so you'll have to keep casting the
      "castle" spell at it to make it bigger.

      The levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can hurt you with their attacks, but
      killing them is often necessary, as upon death they will release some of the mana you need to complete the level.
      To attack your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal: fireballs, lightning bolts and meteors.

      There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal yourself, surround yourself with a
      protective shield, teleport around, summon a skeleton army, or even modify the terrain by creating volcanoes and
      splitting landmasses. Not all spells are available to you from the beginning, though.

      Throughout all the levels, you are on your flying carpet, which can move in 3 dimensions. You can bring up a
      top-down map at any time.</story>

    <story>The balance in the magical world of Cefiro is supported by the prayers of the lovely princess Emerald. When
      the evil Sage Master imprisoned her, the existence of the entire world was endangered. Using her spiritual powers,
      the princess contacted three Japanese high-school girls, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, turned them into Magic Knights, and
      summoned them to Cefiro, where their goal is to save her and to restore the balance.

      This adaptation of the eponymous manga and anime series is an action adventure, somewhat similar in style to Zelda
      games. The protagonists are all the three girls, but the player can controls only one of them at a time. Each one
      has advantages and disadvantages, as well as different fighting styles: Hikaru uses swords, Umi a rapier, and Fuu
      a bow. The player advances through the game by exploring the world, talking to non-playable characters, and
      fighting enemies in real-time combat. There is no experience system; new abilities (among them swimming and
      jumping) are gained as dictated by the story, and must be used in certain points in order to advance.</story>

    <story>This is the very first coin-op game (and home conversions) in the Magical Drop series. Similar to other
      titles in the series, the goal of the game is to clear the screen of constantly advancing objects called ?drops'.
      The player character, stuck at the bottom of the screen, has a grapple which can be used to pull down a single
      drop, change its colour and put it back in line. Drops disappear when a line of three or more drops of the same
      colour is created.</story>

    <story>Magical Drop is played in a style and gameplay similar to Compile's (now Sega's) Puyo Puyo and Taito's Puzzle
      Bobble franchises; a "stack" of random colored bubbles descend from the top, and a player is defeated when a
      bubble hits the bottom. Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player's "clown" at the bottom, and are
      destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. "Chains" are formed either
      when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick
      succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the
      opponent's stack to descend faster.</story>

    <story>Marvel Super Heroes is a 2D fighting game and the second Capcom title to feature characters from the Marvel
      comic universe. The gameplay is very similar to X-Men: Children of the Atom, but with a simplified Super Combo
      gauge and the addition of infinity gems. Each character starts with a set of gems. These can be activated during a
      fight to improve speed, power and defence, or provide special abilities to create crushing stone walls, open up a
      rift in space, or reverse the opponent's controls. The use of the gems is inspired by the The Infinity Gauntlet
      comic book series.

      There are ten playable characters. The heroes are Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Psylocke,
      Spider-Man and Wolverine. The villains are Blackheart, Juggernaut, Magneto and Shuma-Gorath. Anita from the
      Darkstalkers series is a hidden character in the Japanese version. The bosses are Doctor Doom and Thanos. During
      the boss fight Thanos steals all the player's gems (except for mind) and uses them with new effects.</story>

    <story>Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter is a 2D fighting game and the first to combine characters from
      Capcom's Street Fighter series with those of the Marvel comic universe. It is also the first in Capcom's games to
      introduce a tag team style of combat where the player can call for another character during a fight.

      Matches consists of two-on-two battles where the player can only control one character at a time. The other
      character can be called in regularly or while doing an attack. The off-screen one also regains some health while
      waiting. Both opposing characters need to be defeated to win the match, and when one dies the other is called in
      automatically. The tag team options introduces Variable Attack, Variable Counter and Variable Combination where
      the two characters team up to attack, counter of perform a special move.

      Most of the X-Men characters were already present in X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes: Cyclops,
      Storm, Juggernaut, Magneto and Wolverine, with the addition of Rogue, Gambit and Sabretooth. The Street Fighter
      characters are gathered from Street Fighter Alpha 2: Ryu, Ken, Cammy/Chun-Li, Charlie, Zangief, Dhalsim, M. Bison
      and Akuma. The final boss of the game is Apocalypse.

      The PlayStation version does not include the tag team feature and relies on the more traditional best-two-of-three
      round setup.</story>

    <story>You are the genetically engineered Clan Mechwarrior. The Clans are invading the Inner Sphere. Join either the
      Wolf Clan or the Jade Falcon Clan as they pursue their own agenda against the Inner Sphere and other Clans. Take
      your advanced Omnimechs into battle against all comers. Win high warrior ratings (by using less mechs or smaller
      mechs than needed, completing secondary objectives, etc.) and you'll get chance at a promotion trial where you
      face superior odds in an arena. If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can make it all
      the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan!

      Mechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this
      time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns.
      Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in
      order to use less than the "par" force in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as
      this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than anything that came before. Let
      addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each other online. When 3D cards came along, special versions were
      created to take advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it's nonetheless a

    <story>Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story is a trilogy of Sega Saturn games set during the One Year War story line. The
      games are unique among Gundam games in and that rather than placing the player in a behind the shoulder third
      person view, they instead put the player in a first person view from the inside of the Mobile Suit's cockpit.

      Gundam. In short, the player is a grunt, and has to work their way through a series of particularly tough
      campaigns. Each game is merely a chapter in the overall plot, and see the player being awarded with progressively
      more powerful mobile suits as they progressed.</story>

      the Outworld. The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than
      the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two
      player mode including same character duels.

      To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung,
      Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks,
      uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts,
      long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.</story>

    <story>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from,
      who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of
      an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page.
      Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're
      here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

      Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger.
      Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its
      mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by
      clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the
      game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

      The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

      The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and
      re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</story>

    <story>The game itself is a pretty standard 3D action-platformer - just get to the end of the level while killing
      bad guys along the way. By default, the camera always faces forward, so Jajamaru automatically strafes when moving
      left and right, which makes it a lot easier to control than most 3D games. The view automatically rotates at 90
      degree angles whenever you hit a turn in a hallway, although you can also adjust the camera with the trigger
      buttons. Like the old games, Jajamaru's main weapons are his shuriken, although he can also find a number of
      spells to attack all of the enemies on the screen and such. There are boss encounters every few levels, which are
      a bit harder to deal with - the camera tries to stay focused on the enemy, so you're constantly circle strafing
      them. Unfortunately, it tends to get lost or hung up, which makes dodging their fire pretty annoying. The
      platforming aspects are awkward when they show up, but they're relatively rare.

      It's a pretty simple and straightforward game, and surprisingly avoids most of the control faults associated with
      early 3D action games. However, it's not particularly pretty, and its simplicity also means that it's quite easy.
      There aren't many levels, so it can be quickly conquered without much time or effort. It's a bit hard to find for
      either platform, and while it's agreeable, it's not compelling enough to justify searching for. Although the
      PlayStation and Saturn versions may look identical on the surface - they have the same cover, and the same
      cutscenes - the level layouts are different in each version. Also, the Saturn version is technically an updated
      version, as it was released later, denoted by the "kin" after the name, meaning "gold". It has a map screen, where
      little old school sprites of Jajamaru, Princess Sakura, and the Catfish pirate show up. Every few stages, you'll
      also get to play a level of the original Ninja Jajamaru-kun game, just to remind you of its heritage.</story>

    <story>Noon is a multiplayer puzzle game that allows up to four players. It takes the overhead gameplay style of
      Bomberman and mixes it with standard puzzle style gameplay. Your goal is to cover your opponents playfield with
      bombs.

      Bombs are made by connecting a row of three or more balls and attacking them, causing them to â€œexplodeâ€ and
      reappear as bombs on your opponents playfield. This is called a NOON. There are five different colors: Orange,
      Yellow, Green, Blue and Multi/Rainbow. When lining up the balls, they must all be the same color. The lone
      exception being the multi color, or rainbow balls which you can mix with any one of the other colors. Rainbow
      balls are key to Rainbow NOONs. These are like regular NOONs only when the Rainbow Ball or balls explode it will
      make adjacent balls explode as well, regardless of color.

      Once you fill your opponents playfield with bombs a counter will begin to countdown from 10. Upon zero you will be
      victorious. If your opponent manages to clear a majority of the bombs from his playfield the counter will stop. If
      you fill his playfield again the counter will resume again from where it left off. Clearing the playfield of bombs
      requires you to either push them off manually or destroying them. To destroy them you simply have to push them
      either against a wall or another bomb/ball until it squishes. You can also squish normal balls. This can come in
      handy if balls of the wrong color are blocking a potential NOON or when you want to ruin an opponent's potential
      NOON. Another positive aspect of squishing balls is that it refills your special attack meter. Each character has
      their own special attack that ranges from filling your opponents playfield with bombs to lining up a row of same
      colored balls for a devastating NOON.</story>

    <story>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the

      The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some
      excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of
      present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder
      of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient
      dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody
      helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three
      sides in the conflict... or are there more?

      "Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you

      game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles,
      you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and
      can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon

    <story>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the
      rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.

      The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some
      excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of
      present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder
      of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient
      dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody
      helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three
      sides in the conflict... or are there more?

    <story>Pappara Paoon (ã ±ã £ã ±ã‚‰ã ±ã Šãƒ¼ã‚“) is a puzzle game released for the Sega Saturn exclusively in Japan.
      A very bare bones, what you see is what you get type of puzzler. There is a vs. CPU mode and a 2P mode.

      You shoot colored "blocks" (ranging from triangles to circles, etc.) to the side of the screen, trying to "push
      out" your opponent. It's a halfway interesting concept. If you liked playing "connect four" growing up (I know I
      did) I guess there are some similarities. You connect four or more like-colors to burst blocks. It's not a
      terrible game per se, it's just not all that exciting or addicting.

      Interesting note though, in 2P mode you can play it one of two different ways. One is where you and your opponent
      can go all out crazy and keep launching blocks OR you can make it more like Chess where there are turns. This is
      probably the coolest feature of the game. It slows the game down and makes it into a real thinking man's kind of
      puzzler. For this gameplay system, it works brilliantly.</story>

      only control the aim, but also how hard you shoot the ball, making it go in an arc across the playing field and
      down the slope. Also, when you make balls disappear the remaining balls fall further down the slope using somewhat
      good physics.

      You can play the game in the usual Story Mode, vs Mode and Endless Mode varieties usually found in this kind of
      puzzler.</story>

    <story>Pebble Beach Golf Links is a golf course on the west coast of the United States, located in Pebble Beach,
      California.

      Widely regarded as one of the most beautiful courses in the world,[3] it hugs the rugged coastline and has wide
      open views of Carmel Bay, opening to the Pacific Ocean on the south side of the Monterey Peninsula. In 2001 it
      became the first public course (i.e., open to the general public for play) to be selected as the No.1 Golf Course
      in America by Golf Digest. Greens fees are among the highest in the world, at $495 (plus $35 cart fee for
      non-resort guests) per round in 2008.

      Four of the courses in the coastal community of Pebble Beach, including Pebble Beach Golf Links, belong to the
      Pebble Beach Company, which also operates three hotels and a spa at the resort. The other courses are The Links at
      Spanish Bay, Spyglass Hill Golf Course, and Del Monte Golf Course.

      The PGA Tour and Champions Tour play annual events at Pebble Beach, AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am and the
      First Tee Open. It has hosted six men's major championships: five U.S. Opens and a PGA Championship. The course is
      included in many golf video games, such as the Links series and the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series.</story>

    <story>The game plays in a vertically tilted orientation, very close to Silpheed. There are times when it tilts less

      Everything is rendered with polygons in a 3D environment, from popcorn enemies to bosses to backgrounds. Itâ€™s
      evident that Planet Joker carries an epic feel thatâ€™s ultimately unmatched by the game itself, with a general
      design that evokes old anime series such as Gloizer X.

      After choosing one out of seven huge available robots, the player must go through seven stages of rather
      repetitive action. The mecha characters differ in power, speed, defense and â€œchargeâ€ , which is certainly
      related to how fast the shield function recharges after being used. This shield makes the player invincible while
      active, and can only be used again after the shield bar has been fully recharged.

      Another special attack is the bomb (C for a radius detonation and W for a straight wave attack), whose stock is
      replenished by appropriate incoming icons. The regular shot can be changed according to a power-up that comes down
      staggering and cycling colors (blue, green and yellow).</story>

      battle in classic Puyo Puyo fashion: In each stage you face off against an opponent in two different play areas,
      one for you and one for your opponent. As the blob-like "puyos" start falling in your play area, you must align
      them and create groups of the same color in order to clear the screen before you get flooded with puyos. Chaining
      puyos of different colors allows you to send several "garbage" puyos to the opposing player's play area in hopes
      of either flooding it, or slowing his advance, and whoever defeats the opposing player moves on to the next
      challenger.

      New for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can be added to combos for extra damage. Also includes 2P vs

      This game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of

      result of this change that may appear strange to players of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top

      player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the playing field without attaching to anything (except for

    <story>An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter
      gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out
      Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The
      mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.

      id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation
      is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows
      for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of
      simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.

      In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct
      episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a
      minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier
      games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.

      Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme
      of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic
      military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments
      inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through
      magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by
      earth colors.

      The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons
      in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade
      launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a
      low-tech feel. Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the
      Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.

      Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels
      can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and
      free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the
      levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially
      designed for deathmatch.</story>

    <story>Quarterback Attack with Mike Ditka is a 1995 football game published by Digital Pictures for the Sega Saturn,
      3DO and DOS. It features Mike Ditka as head coach of the player's team. The only player players can control is the
      quarterback and the defense is rendered in full motion video.

      The game was developed on a budget of two million dollars.[1] The video footage was filmed over two weeks.[1] When
      asked if it was difficult to call up his usual energy when working with a film crew instead of a real game-day
      situation, Mike Ditka said, "I've been called a lot of things, and being called 'an actor' has been one of them.
      It's not that hard to do, really."[2]

      Footage from the game was used in the film Game Over.</story>

      Rayman is side-scrolling platformer starring the titular Rayman, a big-nosed chap with no arms or legs. Rayman can
      jump and use his hair to hover for a short period of time. He can also attack by throwing his fists, or winding up
      his fists for a more powerful punch. He can occasionally find special power ups that grant him unlimited flying
      power, giving him the ability to navigate through tricky mazes.

      Aside from the platforming action, the other notable feature of Rayman is its large, detailed and vibrant
      graphics, which have helped it to stand out from most other similar games in the genre.</story>

    <story>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the
      original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
      place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish
      line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter,
      your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place.

      There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of
      these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are
      also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to
      pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have
      to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have
      completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult
      level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.

      There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start
      the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a
      different bike class.

      If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this
      and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are
      competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over
      again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.

      The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs
      performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These
      songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</story>

    <story>Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have
      to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices
      are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your
      fighter, as well as its special attack.

      Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight
      the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The
      game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are
      thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from
      swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging)
      they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of "boss" robot is put in your way. These "bosses" use special
      weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can
      be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an
      added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some
      one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!

      The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take
      cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a
      ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the
      left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course
      different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.</story>

    <story>Robotica was the first firstperson shooter for the platform and a first generation game for the console. It
      is somewhat similar to Space Hulk, only that the player takes the role of a machine that rebels against the robots
      to save mankind. The weapons include a punch, Vulcan gun, Missiles, and Lasers. The main environment is made up of
      various hallways. The player runs through the various stages collecting keys, using computers, and triggering
      lights. The enemies are relatively basic but are dangerous in numbers.

      The game is set in 2877, 800 years after the world's peacekeeping unions have collapsed. They are replaced with
      World Silent Security Service, a global world order to maintain the security on earth and in space. However, over
      time the role of the order is questioned, and the Reformist Faction rebel group sends three pilots in Laocorn
      assault robots to the WSSS' space station Daedalus in earth's orbit. Two are immediately destroyed, but the player
      gets to control the remaining robot.</story>

      possible threats, the Imperial government of Japan brings together 6 young ladies from around the world to form

      proud spiritual armor, the Kobou, these young women are the frontline of defense against the demon worshippers,
      but they haven't a leader to guide them into battle.

      And, with a single letter, young Navy ensign Ichirou Ohgami's life is about to take a very interesting turn...as
      the chosen leader of the Hanagumi! Ohgami now has to gain the trust of the members of the Hanagumi if he expects
      to keep things under control.

      The gameplay of "Sakura Taisen" is a combination of Japanese-style adventure, "dating simulation", and strategic
      turn-based combat. Most of the game is spent exploring the theater, to which your military base is disguised.
      Depending on your decisions - where to go, which girl to look for, how to answer the questions (there is a time
      limit for responses) - you'll develop different relationships with the girl, which will influence not only further
      dialogues and the ending, but also their parameters in battles. During combat, you navigate your hero and the
      girls over the field and attack the enemies physically, or charge for powerful special attacks. Each turn you can
      perform two different actions, and your walking distance, as well as attack range, is limited and unique to each
      character. There is no experience points system and also no equipment.</story>

      The game plays like the Columns game series, except you play as members of the Imperial Floral Assault Troupe.
      Each member has their own strengths and weaknesses as pertains to playing.

      As an added bonus, while playing you can perform attacks against your opponent similar to the special attacks in
      the Sakura Wars series. You can also eliminate some of the lower gems in your area. These can both be performed
      after creating enough gem chains to fill up your super meter. You can also store your attacks to make them even
      more powerful the next time you fill the meter. At the third storage, you must either attack, erase some of your
      gems, or you can store it up to get three butterfly like blocks that the bottom block will eliminate all of one
      color, whichever color block it touches.

      The game ends when either you or your opponent's gem area is filled to the top, leaving no room for more gems.

    <story>Samurai Shodown III was to be the start of a bold new direction for the franchise. The most obvious
      difference between this game and the others in the series is the notably darker aesthetic. The more light-hearted
      characters (Earthquake, Cham Cham, and Gen-an to name a few) from the previous games have been excised, and even
      the kabuki master, Kyoshiro Senryo, received a redesign, transforming him from a flamboyant stage performer into a
      grim-faced, muscular man. All of the characters have been completely redrawn. The animation is very smooth for all
      characters, another departure from the graphical style of the second game.</story>

      Sangokushi, or Romance of the Three Kingdoms, that focuses on a single major character from the conflict. The
      central character is the noble general Liu Bei of the Shu kingdom of the Three Kingdoms conflict. The game splits
      its time between strategic battles featuring multiple soldier units and an ?adventure? mode where Liu Bei visits
      towns, discusses topics with NPCs, purchases new equipment and recruits for his army. He is usually accompanied by
      his sworn brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.</story>

      Despite its name it is not a direct sequel to Saturn Bomberman, though like most other Bomberman games, the
      gameplay is very similar. Saturn Bomberman Fight!! is unusual in that the game is played in an isometric
      perspective, with a stronger focus on the standard Bomberman battle mode. Characters can now jump over obstacles
      and throw bombs without the need for powerups, and each character has health meter which is subtracted from
      whenever they are hit. It also features more voice acting than in previous titles, which may explain why the game

      Savaki is visually a pleasant surprise with it's 60 fps animation, real time shading, light sourcing, shadow
      reflextions and 3D arena. It even plays very well indeed. There are a vast array of different fighting types to
      choose from too. Karate, Taekwon Do, Muetai, Jeet Kun Do, Dentou Karate, Boxing and of course Free Style for those
      big fat thugs without any real skill. The only down side to Savaki is that there is only one background arena.
      Surely it wouldn't have hurt the programmers to add a few more. Still, overall Savaki is a very nice fighter for

      not self-destruct. But, being a robot, Scud has no money, and must turn to freelance jobs to pay for his original
      target's life support. The game can be played with either a controller or the Virtua Stunner (or other compatible
      light gun). With a controller, the game is a side scrolling shoot-em-up; but with a light gun, it becomes a first
      person shooter. You can play with any combination of controllers and guns, but the game is essentially meant to be
      played with two guns (Scud himself uses two guns). The game is fueled by music from "DJR/IB3 LTD." (Darryl J.
      Reavis &amp; Illuminado Berrios, III), Fidget-X, and Unbelievable Jolly Machine</story>

    <story>A collection of three of Sega's most popular arcade games of the 1980s, translated for the Sega Saturn -
      Outrun, After Burner II and Space Harrier.

      In Outrun, get behind the wheel of your Ferrari and reach the checkpoints in time. Choose your destination as the
      road forks, and make sure you make it to the finish line before the timer reads zero.

      After Burner II allows you to fly the most feared jet fighter in the skies - the SSF-14 - and annihilate the
      enemy. With two Vulcan guns, heat seaking missiles and an afterburner, as well as support from the crew of the
      aircraft carrier Sega Enterprise, the object is to shoot the enemy from the sky - before they get you.

      Space Harrier is a shoot 'em up set in a fantasy future world. Armed with a gun and a jet pack, it is your job to
      rid Dragonland of the demon Absymbel and his evil forces.</story>

    <story>Sega Rally was a major success in the arcades, bringing rally-style racing to the masses before the Colin
      McRae games. Four detailed tracks have been created, with a succession of stomach-churning bends and jumps, and
      you can choose from 3 different cars. As well as the main championship, there is a time-trial mode featuring a
      ghost car to beat, so you always know how your run compares with your best-ever. Two machines can be linked for
      multi-player action. The handling of the cars is unrealistic, to put the focus on action and instant playability.

    <story>After Virtua Racing, Daytona USA and Sega Rally, yet another classic SEGA arcade racer (this time, from the
      Model 2C CRX architecture) is converted for home users. After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega took on the
      popular European Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real models (Alfa Romeo
      155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel Calibra V6) as well as some hidden cars. Some models
      feature four-wheel drive (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have rear-wheel drive (forcing the
      player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn't skid). Because of this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and
      less forgiving than in any of the previous titles by Sega.

      Like with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an "Arcade" and a "PC"/"Saturn" mode (the
      biggest difference being the time constraints and inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with the usual
      Championship (three races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also available. There are
      three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual with contemporary Sega arcade racers), and two viewpoints
      (behind and front bumper) are at the disposal of the player.
      As usual, there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those proficient in the game.

      Another feature was the "Global Ranking" mode, where players of either version could e-mail Sega of Japan a
      password containing his times, and compare them to the World's finest players, as well as in special one-day only
      "Global Net Events".</story>

    <story>Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 (known as Sega Worldwide Soccer PC for the PC and Victory Goal Worldwide Edition in
      Japan) is a football video game by Sega released for the Sega Saturn in 1996. It is the successor to Victory Goal
      and was later followed by three more titles: Sega Worldwide Soccer '98 still on the 32-bit console and two
      editions of Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000, the second being Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000 Euro Edition for the
      Dreamcast.

      Sega Worldwide Soccer 97, produced by Sega themselves was one of the killer apps in the peak of popularity for the
      console.[1] It was preceded by Victory Goal, an already ageing football game (one of the debut titles of the
      console). The game featured international teams and league, play-off and tournament modes. Although it used
      fictional player names (due to the lack of a license), the non-volatile memory of the Saturn allowed editing of
      names. The team kits were as close to the official 1996 kits as possible. The gameplay was also highly praised,
      and was the top-rated football game until ISS 64 was released one year later. Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 was later
      ported to the PC, under the title of Sega Worldwide Soccer PC.</story>

      a suitable fourth planet from an alien sun. However, none of the other Caravans had followed. After 93 years of
      civilization on the new Mother Planet, the investigation of the missing Caravans finally leads to a horrible
      discovery: the previous Caravans had been attacked and conquered by a powerful regime of alien-humans. Commanded
      by the mysterious Shienryu, the alien space fleet invades the Mother Planet and constructs fortresses across the
      world, destroying and replacing any established human influence. In response, a defense team called "Burn Dragoon"
      is founded which calls for the best pilots and navigators to defend the new planet from the invading regime.
      Players control either of two double-piloted ships going against the bases of the regime based both on the new
      mother planet and in space.</story>

      Dado que el juego se lanzó antes del final de la serie, la historia del juego es diferente de la serie al revelar

      correctamente una combinación de teclas. En secuencias que no son de combate, el jugador también puede estar

    <story>Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots of a young general, fighting
      to preserve the peace in your world. The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of
      Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the
      abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies and deceit in your
      quest to prove the King innocent.

      The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who's played them will be
      comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D
      landscape and 3D characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional
      RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to NPC's and searching various items. However, the main
      selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences.

      The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique "friendship" system, whereby the more
      two characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will
      start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as the rock-paper-scissors
      nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear, spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone
      hiding in a forest is going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully intact, and anyone
      who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be very comfortable with the combat system.

      It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force III: Episode I, and was therefore
      only the first episode in an intended series of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released
      outside of Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the storyline.</story>

      Domaric. Although loyal to his father and his country, he senses that there are other forces at work beneath the
      tensions between Aspinia and Destonia. He attends the conference in Saraband on behalf of Destonia, along with his
      brothers Arrawnt and Mageron. As discovered in Scenario 1, much of this influence comes from the Bulzome sect, as
      well as collaborating separatist factions within both Destonia and Aspinia. Medion works parallel to Synbios of
      Aspinia, often disposing of rogue Aspinian elements to spare Synbios's force from fighting against its own
      countrymen. At the end of the game, Medion is forced to battle with Synbios' force when Julian steps in to stop

    <story>Scenario 3, Bulzome Rising, stars Julian, a mercenary who appears as a secondary character in both Scenario 1
      and Scenario 2. He is for all intents and purposes the true main character of Shining Force III. His initial
      motivation as the story begins is to track down and kill Galm, one of, if not the, most powerful member of the
      Vandals, a powerful race of beings that existed over 1,000 years ago. Julian believes that Galm killed his father
      and is seeking revenge. This story arc is first introduced in an earlier Shining game, Shining the Holy Ark, in
      which Julian appears as a young boy who asks the party to search for his missing father.

      Julian joins Synbios in the midst of his quest in Scenario 1, but after an encounter with Galm, he is tossed over
      a waterfall at the suspension bridge and believed by Synbios' army to be dead. He reappears in Scenario 2,
      apparently washing ashore at the site of a battle between Medion's army and the Bulzome Sect. Knowing the sect's
      ties to the Vandals, Julian agrees to fight alongside Medion. As it becomes clear that the sect is trying to kill
      Gracia, a child intended to become the next Innovator (A Shining Series figure equatable to a god), Julian takes
      on the task of protecting him and helping him realize his destiny.

      Scenario 3 starts about 60% through scenario 2's story, and focuses primarily on battles against the Bulzome Sect
      and their allies in both Aspinia and Destonia. While scenarios 1 &amp; 2 happen at roughly the same time, much of
      scenario 3 takes place after both, but there is some "overlap". Eventually Julian leads a three-party coalition
      consisting of the armies of both Synbios and Medion, to engage in the final conflict against Bulzome, a powerful
      Vandal long sealed in another dimension, and the true orchestrator of the conflict.</story>

    <story>Part of the Shining game universe, "Shining the Holy Ark" is a pure console-style RPG (unlike Shining Force
      games, that were strategy/RPG hybrids). You play the role of a young swordsman Arthur, who decided to work as a
      mercenary for various people needing his services. On his first mission, the King of Enrich sends him to a mine,
      in order to find and punish a renegade ninja who has escaped from him. However, an accident occurs that makes
      Arthur realize that he'll have to do much more than his usual mercenary assignment, and that there is a true evil
      in the world that must be defeated at all costs.

      The game features 3D graphics and utilizes first-person perspective for dungeons and battles. The turn-based
      battles are of a traditional Japanese RPG kind, except the addition of "Pixie System". In various places in the
      game you can find pixies who can later be used as allies in battles.</story>

    <story>SimCity 2000 is the successor to the ground breaking city simulation game Sim City. You are once again the
      mayor, but this time you can fully customize the terrain before building your city. The graphics are isometric,
      whereas the original had graphics displayed in a top-down fashion.

      This title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building "light" zones, subways,
      hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and
      your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the
      first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.</story>

      players against a horde of flying enemies. There are three different characters that can be played as, each with
      their own weapon and fighting style. Various magic scrolls can be found by defeating enemies which allow the
      player to cast several different types of spells including lightning and fire.

      The story itself concerns an evil being who sets out looking for a Power Stone and cuts down all in his path with
      his sword, the Sol Divide. It is up to you to stop him, battling your way through several stages in both Arcade
      and Original Mode (which contain different areas and require different tactics to beat, the Original Mode being
      designed as a more difficult experience for players who want to progress on to a higher challenge).

      Defeating enemies rewards the player with different items to help them on their journey, including the
      aforementioned magic scrolls, healing potions, magic bottles (only when playing Arcade Mode) and protection
      accessories (if playing Original Mode).</story>

    <story>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny
      aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge,
      evil Monstars.

      The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as
      the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two
      flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.

      Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one
      involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There
      are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.

      The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team
      Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using
      multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.

      The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le
      Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus,
      Bang, Blanko and Nawt.

      There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory,
      but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will
      get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.

      The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played
      multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the
      rest of the team is substituted in and out.

      There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade,
      lighthearted feel to it.</story>

      a maximum of five. Rival horses are not available for selection to the player: their names are, for instance, the
      ominous- or hilarious-sounding Â«Mr DeviousÂ», Â«Red VisionÂ», Â«Sunk StarÂ», Â«HelpMeÂ», Â«OhMygodÂ»,
      Â«NutseaterÂ». The names are also differentiated by being written all in capital letters the latter ones, normally
      the former.

      Before the beginning of the race, while horses approach the starting point, the name of the circuit, course plan,
      prize money and circuit time record are displayed. During the race, the indicators on the screen are: the course
      plan (with a moving coloured circular indicator representing the position of each contender), the chronometric
      indication of time, the horse's energy bar with a line composed of three segments beside it: a red one (that means
      the horse is in its full strength), a yellow and a blue one (denoting lack of strength); a representation of the
      horse's face, which portrays its, more or less fatigued or strong status and how intensely it is running.</story>

    <story>Another Street Fighter sequel (this time for Street Fighter Alpha) adds even more to the classic fighting
      series.

      New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another
      Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same
      type of moves. Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.

      The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the
      required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which
      there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)</story>

    <story>Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the
      series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and
      Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail
      since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.

      The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training
      and Entry.

      World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run
      into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three
      levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).

      Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds
      per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)

      Versus - Two human players battle it out.

      Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.

      Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes
      in the game (especially handy for Training).

      Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old
      favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.</story>

    <story>Tenchi Muyou! Rensa Hitsuyou is a puzzle game based on the Tenchi Muyou! franchise.

      This is a match 3 style puzzle game combined with the popular Anime Tenchi Muyo. Its gameplay consists of lining
      up chibi versions of the series characters and pulling off combos. Your main objective is to pull off as many
      combos as you can and keeping the water and blocks low by lining up blocks of the same color, which in turn fills
      your opponents screen with water. When your opponents chamber fills with water and they no longer have room for
      any more blocks, it's game over.

      There are ten levels, each pitting you against characters from the series. This game can be very difficult at
      times especially at the later levels. I like the fact that you can choose different characters from the Tenchi
      Muyo universe. I liked that some characters are more defensive than offensive. For example, when some characters
      gather enough blocks they will do a special move depending on what character you are using. They might lessen the
      water that fills your screen, or another character might be more offensive by flooding your screen completely
      giving them a somewhat unique feeling. There are also some hidden unlockables that you can acquire after you meet
      certain conditions. With its charming gameplay and wonderfully animated animations, an average amount of
      replayabiliy and funky music, it makes for a fun distraction for Saturn puzzle fans.</story>

      first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally
      leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the
      park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can
      design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

      Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will
      combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything
      running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

      You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in
      attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure
      that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

      It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and
      Full add more strategic features.</story>

      can be selected, along with its weapons, after clearing all the stages on 1 credit (no continues) and entering a

      Microsoft Windows. It became available for download from PlayStation Store as a PSone Classic for play on the
      PlayStation 3 on January 10, 2008, in PAL regions.[4] The game utilizes 3D environments and truck models. The
      soundtrack features hard rock music. It was the first game to feature vehicles with independent
      suspension.[citation needed]

      In 1996, ASC (publisher) hired Top Dog Entertainment in Austin, Texas, to develop Hardcore 4x4 II (the second
      version). The first Sony PlayStation developer in the Americas, Brett Butler, was lead programmer. He travelled to
      England to collect the game code and world builder tools. Both were defective, so he spent the first month
      repairing the code base. He then designed new tracks, rebuilt the graphics engine in MIPS RISC R3000 assembly, and
      hired artists and designers to create new tracks, menu interfaces, and vehicles. The title was completed in late
      1997 as Top Dog went out of business shortly after Brett Butler left the company.[citation needed]</story>

    <story>Tokimeki Memorial: Taisen Tokkaedama is a puzzle game released in Japan
      based around the characters in Konami's immensely successful Tokimeki
      Memorial game, a (Japanese) high school life and dating simulation. Tokkaedama is the second puzzle game based
      upon TokiMeki, the first is called Tokimeki Memorial Taisen Puzzledama which has more similarities to PuyoPuyo
      than Tokkaedama.

      There are some differences between the PS1 and Saturn versions. the two versions have completely different sets of
      levels for Hirameki (Puzzle) Mode, secondly, the Saturn version, taking advantage of the system's internal
      clock/calendar, lets you enter both your birthday and Shiori's (just like in the actual Tokimemo game).

      Again, taking advantage of the internal calendar, the Saturn version will
      occasionally have character sketches on the "now loading" chalkboard. However, the Saturn version doesn't seem to
      have any attract mode demo battles though it does have some the music as CD tracks on the game disc. Most of the
      other differences between these two versions of the game are fairly minor.</story>

    <story>Lara Croft is a Tomb Raider, an archaeologist who explores ancient sites in search of valuable artifacts. In
      the game, Lara Croft is hired to retrieve an artifact from a tomb in Peru, which turns out to be one of three
      parts of the Atlantean Scion. Soon betrayed by her employer, Lara Croft travels to Greece, Rome and Egypt to
      recover the other parts before this powerful device falls into the wrong hands.

      Tomb Raider is a 3D action/adventure game in which players control Lara Croft from a third person perspective. The
      camera follows Lara as she climbs, jumps, and swims through detailed environs overcoming environmental obstacles
      and deadly fauna. Moving through levels often involves finding spots where Lara can climb, looking for spots where
      Lara can use her acrobatic ability, and sliding blocks and pushing levers to solve puzzles and open passageways.

      Lara is armed with, now trademark, twin pistols with infinite ammunition, but she can pick up higher caliber
      weapons to take on deadlier human opponents. Lara also comes across restorative health packs and has a compass
      with which she can orient herself. Lara’s opponents include animals, gunmen, as well as primeval and supernatural
      beings. Careful explorers can also find secret areas and avoid traps.</story>

    <story>Giant robots really hate giant monsters, and vice-versa. Never has this been more apparent than in Bandai's
      recent Japanese release, Ultraman Legend (or more specifically, Urutoraman: Hikari no Kyojin Densetsu). Based on
      the popular Japanese television series (some incarnations of which have made their way to the States in the past),
      Ultraman Legend is a 3-D fighting game, of sorts.

      In an interesting departure from the norm, the game tackles 3-D using rail-based movement (similar to Crystal
      Dynamics' Pandemonium). Instead of acting within a large circle, the gameplay takes place along a railed line.
      This only becomes apparent when one of the fighters is launched backward and begins to appear into the foreground
      (often knocking over those large buildings that have become a staple of Japanese monster movie cinema), until the
      screen compensates and reverts to the standard 2-D side shot. Like I said, "3-D fighting game, of sorts."

      If you're a fan of the old TV series, you're in luck: The gang's all here. The heroes consist of the original
      Ultraman, Ultraman Jack, Ultraman Taro, Ultraman Ace, and Ultraseven. The real stars are the monsters though, such
      as the earth burrowing Gomora, bizarre doughboy Eleking, Godzilla lookalike Redking, the "evil Ultraman" Ace
      Killer, clunky robotic King Joe, Gamera-like Bemstar, colorful lobster-head Metron, and Ultraman's main nemesis,

    <story>Valora Valley Golf is an exaggerated approach to the world of golfing. While it does feature traditional golf
      course hazards like water hazards and bunkers, lava pits and greens on top of a mountain are also present.

      The courses ranges from basic looking golf courses with long fairways where the player can drive the ball 450
      yards in one shot and giant water hazards to ancient ruins and a course inside of a volcano.

      The controls are simplistic, click one time to bring up a meter, clicking again to set the angle and once more for
      how much power to drive the ball with special shots are obtained at the end of the meter. It doesn't feature any
      real life golfers or courses.</story>

    <story>Darkstalkers 3, titled in Japan as Vampire Savior: The Lord of Vampire , is the second sequel in the
      Darkstalkers series of fighting games by Capcom, originally released in arcades in 1997. The game retains the
      character roster of Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors, omitting Donovan, Huitzil and Pyron from the lineup. Taking
      their place were four new characters: Jedah, Lilith, Q-Bee and B. B. Hood. It also features a secret
      character/mode, Shadow, where the player assumes the identity of the defeated character for the next fight (e.g.
      if Morrigan is defeated, the next fight the player will play as Morrigan).

      Vampire Savior eschews the traditional round-based system in favour of what is dubbed the "Damage Gauge System",
      where battles take place during a period of one round, with each fighter having two "life markers" (equivalent to
      two life bars) by default, which diminish after one character runs out of vitality. The player can also regain a
      portion of their life during battle if they manage to avoid taking further hits. The game also introduces the
      "Dark Force System" which allows players to perform special abilities unique to each character for a limited
      period.</story>

      strategic elements than adventure elements.

      The combat takes place in a series 3D grid based maps and each character in the party has a certain amount of
      movements they can perform each turn. As the game progresses, other characters join and leave the party and as
      they increase in level they can progress along different paths of development. Between each battle there is a cut
      scene that develops the plot using the same 3D engine as the combat (and often the same areas).

      In between battles you have the opportunity to talk to people in cities as well as purchase different equipment
      for the up coming battles.</story>

      that is running riot in some unspecified town. Dropped into a series of locations, one or two players must arm up

      Starting the game armed with just a trusty old six-shooter, players can pick up more powerful, state-of-the-art
      weapons -- such as machine guns and shotguns -- as they progress. As these are hidden away in crates and the like,
      finding these weapons is an important part of the game and they can give players extra firepower when they most
      need it. In particular, such weapons can be extremely useful when trying to take on the customary end-of-level

      Lau are invited to the World Fighting Tournament, and are joined by the master of drunken Kung-Fu Shun-di, who
      wants to prove he's more than an old geezer and Lion Rafale, who's fighting for his freedom. Each fighter has his
      own style, from the lightning fast attacks of Pai to the powerful slams of Jeffry.

      Home port of Sega's popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game modes include classic arcade mode,
      2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer character progressively learns and counters players' technique),
      Ranking Mode (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style analysis is shown based on number of specials
      and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two teams composed of five fighters go against each other,
      the first to beat five characters being the winner) and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and then see them
      fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked version available only in Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the
      same style from the first game, adding more moves to each fighters' roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick
      and punch, being possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the player is able to control their
      fighter, aiming to knock or push the opponent outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the
      quickest, which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves that require more button
      presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with the previous game, fighting is realistic (except the
      physics-defying leaps), and each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.

      While in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical quality (such as the texture
      details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps to bring the arcade
      experience home.</story>

    <story>Virtua Racing or V.R. for short, is a Formula One racing arcade game, developed by Sega AM2 and released in
      1992. Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under
      development, the "Model 1". The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully developed into a
      standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run
      in 1988) and Atari (Hard Drivin' in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of polygon count,
      frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple camera angles and 3D human non-player characters,
      which all contributed to a greater sense of immersion. Virtua Racing is regarded as one of the most influential
      video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games and for popularizing 3D
      polygonal graphics among a wider audience</story>

    <story>Virus is an adventure game with elements of a shooter, similar in concept to Snatcher, but with much more
      developed and frequent combat. During the adventure portions of the game, the player views locations and talks to
      characters from first-person perspective, interacting with the environment by selecting command icons from a bar
      on the bottom of the screen, and then moving the cursor on the screen to select the object to interact with in a
      point-and-click fashion.</story>

      the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the
      character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level
      aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass
      (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d
      logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them
      costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.</story>

    <story>Winter Heat is the home conversion of the DecAthlete (also known as Athlete Kings) sequel, replacing
      decathlon by Winter sports. Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight
      athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade
      are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi
      Kadiena).

      The game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The
      events include:

      1. Speed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over
      200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button to gain speed.

      2. Ski Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the
      angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early
      will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).

      3. Downhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to miss the gates, and the challenge
      is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action
      button to jump hills perfectly.

      4. Short Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad controls the direction of the
      athlete along the speed button to control the pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold
      second position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less
      button presses.

      5. Skeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the
      tunnels. By pressing the action button it's possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the
      athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.

      6. Slalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint the
      player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early
      or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.

      7. Aerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a "click-along" version, the player starts by
      setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by
      mashing the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when
      the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To
      complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses

      8. Bobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow down.

      9. Speed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or
      the athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above
      the power bar.

      10. Snowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike
      the other two events, it's possible to miss a gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.

      11. Cross Country:
      The stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during
      downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina.</story>

    <story>WipEout XL is set in the year 2097, around four decades after its predecessor. Instead of the F3600
      anti-gravity racing competition, the game features an even faster and more dangerous tournament: the F5000 AG
      league. The gameplay system is similar to that of the previous game: players race against each other or computer
      in high-speed futuristic environments, liberally picking up weapons scattered around the stages and using them
      against the opponents to finish the race in the highest position.

      Each vehicle is provided with a shield; once this shield is breached (by weapons or other kinds of damage), the
      craft explodes. As in the first game, the vehicles move at very high speeds. The game's four difficulty levels are
      used to crank the speed up and down, with the highest setting corresponding to the highest speed. In addition to
      the main championship mode, there are also challenge modes, winning in which rewards the player with faster game
      settings, new tracks, and new vehicles.</story>

    <story>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a
      generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm
      explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

      Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left
      and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it
      loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a
      worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After
      attacking, the turn ends.

      There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind
      settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as
      ropes and girders.

      There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with
      affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</story>

      that make the whole experience stand out from its brethren. Banpresto also added some cool new modes. There is a
      better Versus Mode with new ideas remixed from the SNES sequel. You'll notice Puzzle Mode makes a triumphant and
      welcome return. There is also a single-player Survival Mode that makes the Tetris allusion complete. This mode is
      pretty laid-back for those of you that want to relax and zone out. For the masochists, the last new mode presents
      a challenge that is more focused on killing and staying alive in a frantic environment.</story>

    <story>Zoop is a puzzle video game developed by Hookstone Productions. Some of its rules resemble those of the
      arcade game Plotting (known in some territories as Flipull), but unlike Plotting, Zoop runs in real time. Players
      control a colored triangle standing in a 4x4 square in the center of t h e screen. Lines of different colored
      objects appear from the four rows on each side of the box. The goal is of the screen. Lines of different colored
      objects appear from the four rows on each side of the box. The goal is to destroy those objects before they go on
      your square. A, B, and C shoot. If players shoot an object of the same color as them, the object will be destroyed
      and they will move on to the next object in that row. When players have depleted the row, they will move back to
      the square (facing the opposite direction). If they hit an object of a different color, they swap colors with that
      object and return to their square, allowing them to shoot different-colored objects.</story>
